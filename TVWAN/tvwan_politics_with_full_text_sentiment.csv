Electoral system queried,31/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6652,"Leader of the Opposition, Douglas Tomuriesa, raised questions in Parliament today on the biometric voting system and a fallback strategy should the system fail during the 2027 General Elections.
He raised concerns about the Biometric voting system being pushed forward by the Minister for Administrative Services, Richard Masere.
Tomuriesa directed this specific question to Prime Minister James Marape. The Leader of the Opposition said the government must ensure that voters can still participate effectively, regardless of potential technical issues.
Tomuriesa queried the government on what their contingency plans are should the Biometric voting system face challenges in the next elections.
He called for a reliable electoral process. Tomuriesa emphasized that any failure of the biometric system could undermine the integrity and smooth functioning of the elections.
Prime Minister James Marape, in response, said the Government committed in the 2022 elections that it would make it a priority to provide transparent and fair electoral roll platforms to allow people to vote fairly and freely.
Tomuriesa raised critical questions about the preparedness and resilience of the electoral framework, particularly the implementation of new technologies like the biometric voting, which aims to enhance transparency and security.
As the conversation on this issue develops, it is likely to prompt further discussions on electoral processes, voter confidence, and the measures necessary to uphold democratic standards in Papua New Guinea's upcoming 2027 election.
The Prime Minister acknowledged that there is a need for a better voting system. So the government is making sure to tidy the election, including the common roll.",Politics,Anticipation,,,,

The Committee determined that the Notice of Motion cannot be placed on the Notice Paper because Constitutional Amendment No. 48 (Motions of No Confidence) Law 2025 is in operation.

Marape welcomes fresh VoNC,30/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6640,"Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed yet another Motion of Vote of No Confidence filed by the Opposition in Parliament today, Wednesday, October 29, 2025.
He said it is part of the democratic process and reflects the Constitutional rights of Members of Parliament to choose their leaders freely and without pressure.
Speaking after Parliament was informed of the new Motion’s admission by the Private Business Committee, Prime Minister Marape said he holds no fear or resentment towards the process. He said he will not resort to Political Camps or “behind-the-scenes lobbying” as often seen in past political struggles.
Prime Minister Marape has welcomed any challenge. He stated it is not the first and may not be the last. But remains focused on governing and serving the country.
The Prime Minister emphasized that he has faced multiple Political and Legal challenges since assuming Office on 30 May 2019, including the 2020 Political Impasse, numerous court cases, and repeated attempts to destabilise his government.
“We faced Politics in 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024, and now again in 2025. But through it all, our Government has stood firm. We delivered the highest number of MPs returned for any Party in a National General Election since the Somare Government in 1982 National General Election. We have grown our country's economy by over K50 billion since 2019. The records speak for themselves — in economic management, infrastructure delivery, and service expansion,” he said.
The Prime Minister reaffirmed his commitment to democratic principles and political maturity, saying that Papua New Guinea must move away from the destructive culture of political camps and secret deals.
“Under my watch, there will never be a Political Camp. We have just celebrated 50 years of Independence. It is time we mature as leaders. Members of Parliament have the full freedom to make their choice without coercion, without fear, and without inducement. Exercise your God-given Freedom of Choice,” he declared.
PM Marape said that history has shown that frequent changes in Government between 1975 and 2002 contributed to the country’s slow growth and instability. He urged all Leaders to rise above narrow politics and place national interest first.
He also made it clear that he will not interfere with the process or engage in political maneuvering, saying he will even travel out of the country next week to give MPs total freedom to make their choice in his absence.
Meantime, he called on ordinary Papua New Guineans to also prepare for their moment of choice, reminding them that the 2027 National General Election is only 14 months away.
“I encourage every Papua New Guinean who has a political opinion — your right to construct a Government comes at the polls in 2027. Vote purposely. Vote for a Leader of your choice and for a Party that represents your values,” Prime Minister Marape urged.
He reminded the nation that democracy gives equal opportunity to every citizen and political party to seek a mandate through the ballot, not through destabilizing Parliament.
“This Vote of No Confidence Motion is just a distraction. Let us remain focused on the real opportunity ahead — the 2027 Elections.”",Politics,Trust,,,,

Electoral Commissioner Simon Sinai said all election materials including polling kits and ballot papers have been dispatched to all provinces, adding that election managers and their assistants have been working tirelessly to sort out material distribution according to the number of wards and polling teams in each province.

The LLG President will be elected by the elected ward councilors in the chamber.
Voters in 14 coastal provinces will be issued two ballot papers. One ballot paper is for the candidate contesting the ward and the other, for the candidate contesting the LLG president. Voters will directly vote for the president.
Mr Sinai said provinces can decide on when to commence polling, but it must be done within the specified polling period of October 27 and November 10, 2025.",Politics,Trust,,,,

Construction will follow a Papua New Guinea-led design and consultation process, and draw on local craftsmanship and expertise.

Museum Deputy Director, Prof. Dr. Alexis von Poser, also highlighted digital recordings of PNG’s traditional music and cultural performances currently preserved by the museum.
In a separate visit to the Federal Archives, the Governor General viewed early German colonial records of land occupation and registration in former German New Guinea territories, particularly in parts of Madang and East New Britain.
The Archives, led by President Prof. Michael Hollmann, has embraced digital technology to make its colonial records more accessible globally.
Discussions are currently underway between the PNG Lands Commission and the Bundesarchiv to trace and identify historical records of land ownership from the colonial period. The initiative could support PNG’s land administration and cultural preservation efforts.
Sir Bob’s visit underscores the growing partnership between PNG and Germany in preserving and understanding shared histories — a step toward reclaiming and recognizing the legacies of PNG’s colonial past.","International, Trust",International,Trust
Voters welcome MKA election,17/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5273,,,,"The one-day polling for the Motu Koita Assembly (MKA) elections took place today, after being deferred due to logistical requirements.

LLG polling deferred,10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5174,,,,"The 2025 Local Level Government elections in Papua New Guinea has been further deferred to late September. This postponement is aimed at ensuring a smoother electoral process, allowing more time for preparation and implementation of necessary logistical arrangements.
According to the PNG Electoral Commission, a range of complex and unresolved administrative and fiscal challenges will not allow for the agreed LLG election schedule to be met, forcing a revision of the LLG election timetable.
Polling was initially scheduled for July 12, 2025. It is being deferred to the end of September to avoid a clash with activities surrounding the country’s 50th independence anniversary.
The decision to delay the polling also arise from a variety of factors, including;
-	The unprecedent scale and complexity of the elections underway,
-	Proclamation and late notification of new Wards and LLGs,
-	Administrative irregularities requiring resolution by DPLGA; and
-	Funding and procurement delays
Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai said after careful consideration and consultation with key stakeholders, he invoked his powers under Section 79 (2)(b) of the organic Law on National and Local Level Government Election to delay the commencement of polling for LLG elections.
Sinai also stated that under section 96A, he is withdrawing the writs in those LLGs where the proper conduct of the elections cannot be assured.
Local Level Government elections are crucial for governance at the grassroots level. Sinai said ensuring a fair and efficient electoral process is essential for the democratic functioning of the country.","Politics, Anticipation",Politics,Anticipation

This significant meeting with the Head of the Commonwealth comes as part of the Prime Minister’s broader participation in the Harmony Summit, which brings together participants from different parts of the world - indigenous voices, philanthropists, scientists, private sector champions and others to advance global dialogue on environmental sustainability and ecological stewardship.
Marape, who will arrive in London from the United States where he was engaged in other official duties, will be received at Gatwick Airport by Betty Palaso, Papua New Guinea’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. The PNG High Commission is coordinating the Prime Minister’s itinerary in the UK.
The highlight of Prime Minister Marape’s visit will be his one-on-one audience with His Majesty King Charles III at 11:10am London local time.
This personal meeting underscores the shared commitment between Papua New Guinea and His Majesty in the fight against climate change and the preservation of nature’s biodiversity.
“It is an honour to meet His Majesty King Charles III once again, and I thank him sincerely for the personal invitation,” said Prime Minister Marape ahead of the meeting. “Papua New Guinea shares the same values as His Majesty in protecting forests, preserving biodiversity, and promoting indigenous wisdom in sustainable development.”
-	PNG plays a critical role in global conservation efforts:
-	It is home to 7 percent of the world's biodiversity,
-	Co-hosts 13 percent of global biodiversity, and
-	Is part of the largest oceanic ecosystem in the world.
“Papua New Guinea comes to this Summit not just as a participant, but as a key advocate for stronger global recognition of our vital contribution to Earth’s biodiversity and climate stability,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
“Our forests, seas, and cultures are not only rich in beauty and tradition, but they also serve as the lungs and conscience of the world.”
Importantly, the Prime Minister’s meeting with King Charles III comes ahead of Papua New Guinea’s 50th Independence Anniversary on 16 September 2025.

Lae candidates urged to use clean tactics,28/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5020,,,,"Candidates contesting the Lae Urban LLG are being urged to use clean campaign strategies.
Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, made the call after being made aware of the use of misinformation and fear-based campaigning tactics by candidates.
Rosso said several individuals have been using his name, as well as contentious issues like evictions, to gain political mileage by misleading the public.
“I want to make it very clear that the Lae City Authority (LCA) is a legally sanctioned authority and is here to stay for as long as I am the Member for Lae,” Rosso stated.
He emphasised that LCA has played a pivotal role in transforming the city, with real development outcomes now visible across Lae, and attributed this to the proper and transparent use of public funds.
“From road upgrades to public spaces and services, the LCA has delivered, and the transformation of Lae speaks for itself,” said the Deputy Prime Minister.
Rosso also took the opportunity to address ongoing confusion and political manipulation surrounding several eviction cases in Lae.
“Bumbu Barracks was a court-ordered eviction initiated and won by the Police Department. It had nothing to do with my office or any political interference,” he clarified.
The DPM also explained that the area behind the National Polytechnic Institute of PNG is a designated flood zone, where no permanent structures should exist.
“There were also serious issues involving theft, property damage, and even attempted sexual assault on students by some individuals residing there. Public safety must come first,” Rosso said.
“For Kapiak Street eviction, the land in question belongs to PNG Ports, which obtained a court-ordered eviction through legal processes.
“Again, it is a legal process through court order by the legal title holder, PNG Ports.”
DPM Rosso also acknowledged the complex land ownership dispute currently unfolding over the former Department of Primary Industry land at Three-Mile.
He said the land has allegedly been illegally sold to individuals, and it is now being contested by DPI, the Livestock Development Corporation, and the Fresh Produce Development Agency.
“I am working to resolve this matter in a fair and lawful manner, but I urge people to be cautious of false land sales,” he warned.
Rosso urged all candidates to run clean, fact-based campaigns and stop using the struggles of people for political gain.
“Leadership is about truth, responsibility, and serving our communities; not manipulation, fear, or false promises.”
He ended his statement by calling on the people of Lae to stay focused on unity and progress.
“Let’s work together to continue building a better, safer, and cleaner Lae City.”","Politics, Fear",Politics,Fear

“I rise today not with joy, but with a heavy heart. Heavy from the weight of broken promises, from the cries of a grieving nation, and from the silence that has gripped this Parliament for far too long.
“When Prime Minister James Marape took office in 2019, we watched with hope as he declared the vision to “Take Back PNG” – a powerful phrase that stirred the soul of this nation. A million hopes were pinned to that phrase. He told us we would become the “richest black Christian nation on earth.”
“ We believed him. We believed because we wanted to believe—that at long last, a leader had come to bring dignity, opportunity, and justice to our people.”
However, he said that belief lies shattered.
Sir Puka further stated that this was not a vote of ambition as it is a vote of accountability and a vote of conscience.
“Mr. Speaker, what is the role of government if not to uplift its people?
“What do we say to the father in East Sepik who cannot afford a bag of rice because inflation has eaten away his wage?
“What do we say to the mother in Tari who cannot find medicine for her child because hospitals are collapsing under neglect?
“What do we say to the student in Lae who dares to speak out against corruption, only to be branded a terrorist under a law designed to silence truth?”
Sir Puka claimed that under this Prime Minister, the country have seen betrayal after betrayal including:
-	He promised jobs: Yet youth unemployment remains one of our greatest ticking time bombs.
-	He promised food security: Yet we import over K2 billion worth of rice each year, while our land—some of the most fertile in the world—lies idle.
-	He promised justice: Yet corruption has become institutionalised. ICAC remains toothless, and major scandals—remain unresolved.
-	He promised safety: Yet our women are raped, our children murdered, and our towns turned into battlegrounds. And still, the Government shields itself behind amended laws and calls the people’s pain “fake news.”
“Mr. Speaker, this Prime Minister did not just fail. He changed the rules to protect himself from the consequences of failure.”

Sir Puka Calls For Speaker To Resign,01/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3828,,,,"Member for Abau, Sir Puka Temu has called on Speaker Job Pomat, Deputy Speaker Koni Iguan and the five members of the Private Business Committee (PBC) to resign in light of the Supreme Court ruling declaring their collective actions unconstitutional.
The PBC members include: Provincial Member for Hela Phillip Undialu (Chairman), Southern Highlands Provincial Member, William Powi (Deputy), Provincial Member for Manus, Charlie Benjamin, Provincial Member for Gulf, Sir Chris Haiveta, and Provincial Member for Western, Toboi Yoto.
Sir Puka said that before the ruling, the Private Business Committee acted with an inflated sense of authority, which gave them the misleading view that they could overly scrutinise, dissect, and examine motions of no confidence.
“The Supreme Court ruling now confirms that the committee must not act outside its jurisdiction of being custodians of the principle of ‘collective responsibility of the Executive to the People’ and ensuring this motion of importance reaches the floor for Parliament to decide.
“Complicating or frustrating the process of moving a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister frustrates the rights of the people. The judgment has made it clear that section 165 of the standing order is unconstitutional and that the committee should not be nit-picking motions of no confidence based on its perceived defects.
“This also confirms that the actions of the committee last year to deny three motions of no confidence naming Governor Allan Bird as the alternative prime minister was wrong, unconstitutional, and a ploy to protect the Prime Minister.”
Sir Puka recommended that the PBC membership be overhauled to only include the Speaker as Chair, two members from Government, and two members from the Opposition.
“They must meet any day and not just on Wednesdays during Parliament sitting days. Other functions for Private Member Bills be referred to other relevant Parliamentary committees on Bills,” he said.

Court orders Speaker to recall Parliament,31/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3810,,,,"The Supreme Court has ordered the Speaker of the National Parliament to recall Parliament to meet on April 8, 2025 and to facilitate debate on the motion of no confidence of November 27, 2024.
The five-men bench consisting of Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika, Justice Cannings, Justice Hartshorn, Justice Kariko and Justice Dingake declared that the Private Business Committee's decision of November 27, 2024 to reject a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister was unconstitutional and was in breach of s111 (right to introduce bills etc) of the Constitution.
The court ruled that the Parliament's resolution of September 12, 2024 to reject a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister did not perforce of ss 50(1)(e), 111(1 142(5) and 145 of the Constitution, restricting the right of members of the Parliament to submit another motion of no confidence in the same Prime Minister.
On November 27, 2024, the National parliament disallowed a motion of no confidence against the Prime Minister on the ground that it was brought within 12 months after a motion of no confidence in the same Prime Minister was defeated on 12 September 2024.
The applicant then filed an application in the Supreme Court under s 18(1) of the constitution, seeking a declaration that S165 of the Standing Orders in, so far as it is invoked in relation to a motion of no confidence against the Prime Minister, and that the decision to rely on it to disallow the motion of no confidence against the Prime Minister of 27 November 2024 was unconstitutional. The applicant also sought orders for the parliament to be recalled within seven days to debate the motion of no confidence of November 27, 2024.
The court among other orders today ordered the speaker to recall parliament and for the private business committee to deliver the motion of no confidence of 27 November 2024 to the clerk who shall list it on the notice paper forthwith.
It was declared that the decision of the Private Business Committee to not place the motion of no confidence on the notice paper was contrary to the principle of collective responsibility of the executive arm of government to the Parliament under s 141 of the Constitution.
The Court also declared that s 165 of the Standing Orders, to the extent that it applies to a motion of no confidence, is unconstitutional for being inconsistent with ss 50(1)(e), 111(1), 142(5) and 145 of the Constitution.","Politics, Anticipation",Politics,Anticipation
Deputy opposition leader’s application rejected,05/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3458,,,,"The Supreme Court today refused an application for an interim injunction on the proposed amendment to section 145 of the Constitution filed by Deputy Leader of Opposition James Nomane.
Nomane filed the application under Section 18(1) of the Constitution seeking to restrain the Parliament from dealing with a proposed constitutional amendment regarding motions of no confidence in the Prime Minister.
The application was based on Order 3 rule 2(a) of the Supreme Court Rules, which allows for interim orders to prevent prejudice to the claims of the parties.
The Supreme Court ruled that it lacks clear jurisdiction to grant the interim order as it would violate the right to freedom of speech, debate, and proceedings in Parliament guaranteed by Section 115(2) of the Constitution.
The Court also found that the applicant failed to demonstrate that the interim order was necessary to prevent prejudice to his claims.  The substantive application could still proceed and succeed even if the constitutional amendment was made.
The application for an interim order was refused and the applicant was ordered to pay the interveners' costs.
Nomane in a press conference today said the proposed amendment was the protective veil that the Prime Minister James Marape was trying to enact to insulate him until the 2027 National General Elections.
“The court refused my application on the grounds that they lacked jurisdiction, as the Supreme Court could not interfere with Parliamentary proceedings and in so doing enforced the separation of powers pursuant to section 99 of the Constitution.
“In protecting the rights of Members of Parliament to have freedom of speech, debate, and engage in Parliamentary proceedings consistent with section 115(2) of the Constitution, the interim injunction was refused.
“However, on paragraph 3 of page 6 of the decision, the decision further states that the proposed amendment would have nil effect on the vote of no confidence since “the proposed constitutional amendment would operate prospectively, not retrospectively.”
“That means a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister can be moved at any time, after which, the proposed amendment will kick in. In short, it does not start from 12 September 2024 when the VONC failed with Renbo Paita as the alternative prime minister nominee. “
Furthermore, Nomane clarified that the Supreme Court ruled that the challenge could be made pursuant to a special reference under section 19 of the Constitution.
“The good news is that section 19 reference is already on foot and the proposed section 145 amendment to the constitution will be rendered sub judice and now allowed to be debated, deliberated, or discussed in Parliament.
“In short, the opportunity for a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister is available anytime Parliament convenes and will occur swiftly if the Supreme Court rules favorably on the substantive section 18 Application set for trial on Friday March 14, 2025.
“Therefore, the vote of no confidence is being vigorously defended in the Courts to ensure that the executive government is held accountable by Members of Parliament.”","Politics, Anticipation",Politics,Anticipation
Maladina meets with Indonesian leaders,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3347,,,,"To formalize the growing partnership between the two nations, PNG and Indonesia have agreed to work towards a structured understanding that will facilitate deeper cooperation in resource development, infrastructure, and capacity building.
This comes after close discussions between the Minister for Petroleum, Jimmy Maladina and Indonesia’s Vice Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources, Yuliot Tanjung, the Chairman of SKK Migas, Djoko Siswanto, and the Director General of Oil and Gas, Dr Lng. Tri Winarno, to advance cooperation in the petroleum sector.
Discussions focused on regulatory models, infrastructure ownership, and investment security to ensure PNG’s petroleum sector remains competitive and beneficial to the nation.
Both Minister Maladina and Vice Minister Tanjung emphasized the importance of strengthening bilateral collaboration, not only at the government level but also through greater people-to-people interaction, knowledge sharing, and industry partnerships.
""Indonesia has developed a robust petroleum sector, and there is much we can learn from their experience. This engagement is a step forward in ensuring PNG adopts best practices while also creating opportunities for strategic partnerships in our energy sector,"" said Minister Maladina.
Both ministers have agreed to look at opening collaboration in looking at Petroleum exploration works around the offshore and onshore blocks on the borders of both countries.
The meeting marks a significant milestone in PNG’s ongoing efforts to refine its petroleum sector policies and frameworks. Strengthened cooperation with Indonesia will play a key role in shaping PNG’s long-term energy strategy while fostering regional economic ties.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
PNG-Australia relationship strengthened,24/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3312,,,,"Prime Minister James Marape has reaffirmed the strong and enduring relationship between Papua New Guinea and Australia during a series of successful meetings in Sydney recently.
Last Friday, Marape paid a courtesy visit to the Australian Governor-General, Ms Sam Mostyn AC, where they engaged in discussions on the deep historical ties and shared future of both nations.
“I affirmed that our relationship with Australia is a valued and foundational one, dating back to Papua New Guinea’s sovereignty in 1975. Since then, Australia has stood with us every step of the way, contributing significantly to our progress over the past 49 years as we approach our 50th anniversary of independence,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
Marape acknowledged that Australia’s ties with Papua New Guinea extend far beyond 1975, with strong historical, economic, and security cooperation dating back to the colonial era.
He emphasised that Australia has been a key partner in PNG’s development long before independence and remains committed to its progress today.
During the meeting, the Prime Minister also highlighted ongoing bilateral cooperation and discussed ways to strengthen PNG-Australia relations across key areas, including trade, investment, governance, and security.
A key highlight of the discussion was Prime Minister Marape’s invitation to the Governor-General to attend a special 50th-anniversary event in Papua New Guinea dedicated to honouring women and girls.
This landmark event, scheduled within PNG’s 50th-anniversary celebrations (September 16, 2025 – September 15, 2026), will call upon all men and boys in the country to formally recognize and celebrate the contributions of women in Papua New Guinea.
“The Governor-General is a strong advocate for women’s rights, with a distinguished background as a businesswoman and community leader, and she has graciously accepted our invitation. She commended PNG on its progress and reiterated Australia’s continued commitment to supporting our development and aspirations,” Prime Minister Marape added.
The discussions also reinforced Australia’s long-standing support for PNG’s development, spanning infrastructure, education, healthcare, and economic growth.
Marape acknowledged the critical role Australia has played—not just during his tenure as Prime Minister, but over the past five decades—in shaping PNG’s growth and transformation.
Furthermore, the Prime Minister highlighted PNG’s commitment to fostering a favourable environment for Australian investors, ensuring that trade and commerce between the two nations continue to expand and flourish.
“Australia remains PNG’s largest trading partner, and our people-to-people ties continue to grow. Our government-to-government relationships, institutional partnerships, and economic cooperation have never been stronger,” he said.
A notable milestone in this deepening partnership is the NRL’s official acceptance of Papua New Guinea as the 18th team in the National Rugby League from 2028.
The Prime Minister described this as a powerful symbol of the strength of PNG-Australia relations at every level—from government and business to sports and culture.
“This is yet another step forward in our long-standing relationship, a sign of our growing integration and mutual progress,” he said.
Marape will continue his engagements to the Solomon Islands for bilateral discussions and a major fisheries conference.","Politics, Trust",Politics,Trust
Julius Chan’s uniquely long political career,06/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3075,,,,"According to the
PNG MP Database
, the typical Papua New Guinean Member of Parliament (MP) is in their second term of parliament.
Only seven are in their fifth term, and only two are in their sixth. Sir Julius Chan, who died on 30 January, was in a class of his own.
No one is serving in their seventh, eighth or ninth term but Chan, when he died last week, was in his tenth. He won seats in eight of the ten post-independence general elections, and also won seats in two pre-independence elections, in 1968 and 1972.
If we take 1973 as the starting point (when PNG became self-governing), Chan served in the PNG parliament for 42 years. To put this remarkable achievement in context, only one MP has served in Australia’s parliament for more than 42 years (Billy Hughes), even though Australia became an independent federation as far back as 1901. It helped that Chan started so young, becoming an MP at age 28, and that he lived so long, dying at age 85.
Chan’s political career was so long that it can be divided into two long parts. He served until 1997 as the MP for the Namatanai district of New Ireland, effectively representing his home town. (He was born and spent his early years on Tanga Islands, off the coast of New Ireland.)
He was a popular choice and won elections there from 1968 to 1992 (see the
PNG Electoral Database)
. But he lost the seat in 1997 in a close-run election result, perhaps because of the
Sandline scandal:
his highly controversial attempt to bring in mercenaries to end the Bougainville conflict.
That brought the first phase of Chan’s political career to an end. During that phase, he served as PNG’s first Finance Minister and second Prime Minister (1980-82).
He also served as Prime Minister a second time (1994-97), as well as, at various times, Deputy Prime Minister, Finance Minister (again), Foreign Minister, Minister for Trade and Industry, Minister for Primary Industry and other cabinet positions.
Having lost in 1997, Chan shifted in 2002 to contest the New Ireland provincial seat but lost to Ian Ling-Stuckey. However, Chan won in 2007 and then in every election since, up to and including 2022.
As the New Ireland representative in the national parliament, Chan was both a beneficiary and victim of the reforms he had put in place when Prime Minister. His 1995 Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local Level Governments did away with directly elected provincial premiers and put provincial MPs in charge of provincial governments. So Chan, though a national MP, became New Ireland’s governor. But the same law also weakened provincial governments.
Chan spent the second half of his political career advocating for more provincial autonomy – the sort of autonomy provinces might have had under the original 1977 Organic Law on Provincial Governments.
The real problem with Chan’s New Ireland aspirations, though, was that he was at complete loggerheads with the two MPs representing New Ireland’s districts: Ian Ling-Stuckey, whose father was a close friend of Chan's and who has represented Kavieng on and off since 1997; and Walter Schnaubelt, Chan's nephew, who has represented Namatanai since 2017. These two and Chan repeatedly clashed. While Chan introduced some important provincial initiatives – an age pension and enhanced health care via an Australian NGO – absent a consensus among the province’s political elite, the province floundered.
Returning to his career as a national politician, Chan was certainly one of the most influential policy makers of his generation. Space constraints prevent a full account but Chan achieved a lot – in economic, industrial and foreign policy. He was never a passenger. Bill Farmer, former Australian High Commissioner, when speaking at the
2016 ANU launch of Chan’s memoirs,
referred to his “decisiveness, capacity to cut through, plain speaking, [and] readiness to engage frankly”.
One of Chan’s most important economic policy initiatives was his introduction just before independence of the hard kina policy, a commitment not to depreciate the currency. It worked for a while but fell victim to poor economic policy and tough times more generally. Ironically, it was Chan who, having fixed the kina in 1975, floated it in 1994.
He said in his memoir that he regretted that decision but he had no choice given the balance of payments crisis the country was facing. Perhaps Chan’s greatest achievement was to ensure that – whether the rate was fixed or floating – foreign exchange was freely available for importers who needed to pay their suppliers.
That hasn’t been the case since 2014.
Corruption is a topic rarely mentioned in connection with PNG’s founding fathers. One hardly ever hears of the
corruption case prosecuted in Singapore
that found that Grand Chief Michael Somare had received some US$784,000 in kickbacks for him and his son.
Chan himself was no stranger to allegations of corruption, including in relation to Sandline. The most infamous instance was the 1994 Cairns Conservatory purchase. As Prime Minister, he was personally involved, approving the acquisition for A$18.7 million, despite the same building having been purchased just two weeks earlier by the sellers for A$9.8 million.
An Ombudsman Commission investigation
found that Chan had an undeclared conflict of interest. He, and the political party he led, stood to benefit indirectly from the Cairns purchase. This case, largely forgotten now, was extremely high-profile at the time, and continued to
hit the headlines into the early 2000s
.
Chan also influenced anti-corruption policy, and not in a positive direction. Not long after independence, Prime Minister Somare and his advisers wanted to draw a line between the political and business classes by increasing MPs' salaries and forcing them to divest themselves of their business interests. Pro-business Chan disagreed (so, famously and ironically, did the Australian High Commissioner, who labelled the proposal socialist). This was the first serious policy breach between Chan and Somare, whose coalition had guided PNG up to and then immediately after independence. The disagreement killed the Somare initiative and led, eventually, to the fall of his government in PNG's first successful vote of no confidence, and his replacement by Chan.
What would PNG be like today if there had been a demerger of the political and business classes, and if politics was less about business and more about policy? The two are so intertwined today that it is hard to imagine, and perhaps, even absent Chan’s opposition, Somare’s reform was doomed to fail. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that corruption has become a huge problem in PNG -- the biggest the country is facing according to Chan himself in his memoir. Would it be if this reform had actually gone through?
Sir Julius Chan leaves a mixed legacy, but his extraordinary longevity in politics and parliament as well as his impact across a range of policy domains, before and after independence, guarantee his place in Papua New Guinea’s – and New Ireland’s – history.

Minister Justin Tkatchenko highlighted the work his department has done to foster bi-lateral relations with other countries.
He shared these sentiments during the launch of the Department of Foreign Affairs Housing Policy as well as a new website for the department.
“One of the other big ones, of course, is the United States of America Defense Cooperation Agreement, which is now being implemented throughout our country, Defense Security aspects. We appreciate the American government putting their funds, their commitment and their partnership in a mutual public as well, in this traditional security partner.”
He shared that he is looking forward to continuing the good relationship with the Biden administartion and is looking forward to the new president's commitment to the Pacific.
Minister Tkatchenko acknowledged its place within the South East Asia region.
“Southeast Asia is a focal point for Papua New Guinea. Southeast Asia is one area that Papua New Guinea will be working in bigger and in a more prominent way into the future. Asia is one area that Papua New Guinea has got permanent observer status, but we have now moved forward to become a member in ASEAN. We're working on that as we speak. And we thank Indonesian government, the President and the former foreign minister who was chair, who were pushing and supporting us in that way, going forward for us to be in ASEAN, which will be a fantastic achievement for Papua New Guinea, because we're so strategically placed between Asia and the Pacific.”
Minister Tkatchenko is looking forward to 2025, another year of fostering bilateral relationships with PNG expecting more from South East Asian countries in the near future.","Politics, Anticipation",Politics,Anticipation
Marape hails 2025 Budget,01/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2431,,,,"Prime Minister James Marape has given his total support to the K28.3 billion 2025 National Budget, commending Treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey for handing it down in Parliament last Friday, Nov 29, 2024.
The 2025 National Budget, with the theme ‘Securing Papua New Guinea in 2025 and Beyond’, focuses its attention firstly on addressing Law & Justice and policing challenges in the country as it works at continuing to ease living pressures off families; continues Government priorities under the Medium-Term Development Plan IV; and works at reducing deficit under its 13-year budget recovery strategy.
The K28.3 billion budget is K980 million larger than this year’s (2024) budget of K27.3 billion with revenue at K25.4 billion, which is an increase of over K2 billion on the 2024 Budget of K23.3 billion.
Treasurer Ling-Stuckey told Parliament during his budget delivery speech the continuing increases in revenue are steadily reducing the budget deficit, which has fallen from 8.9 percent of GDP in 2020 down to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2025 “only one-quarter of the level in just five years”.
“Our debt sustainability continues to improve with the debt to GDP ratio dropping down to 47.4 percent in 2025. No matter what the Opposition claims, this is genuine budget repair, built on the back of hard, responsible, responsive, and caring work by the Marape-Rosso Government keeping on the path to a surplus by 2027, and the option for the next Parliament to start paying all our debt by 2034,” Treasurer Ling-Stuckey said.
The Treasurer also said economic growth is increasing from K122 billion in 2024 to K136 billion in 2025, and pointed out a 5.2 percent growth in the non-resource economy.
In line with the budget theme and to alleviate grave concerns on Law & Order in the country, Police will be given K703 million as the Marape-Rosso Government is committed to addressing Law & Order challenges, including increasing police manpower to 10,000 by 2030.
The PNG Defence Force is also being funded in its goods and services, wages and capital budget, while the PNG Judiciary gets a 25 percent funding increase to support more judges coming in. In alleviating living pressures on families, the Marape-Rosso Government continues its Household Assistance Support Package (HASP) into its fourth year in the 2025 budget.
“Goods & Services Tax will be removed from 13 essential items beginning 1 July 2025. The government will continue the K20,000 tax-free threshold, and lift the stamp duty exemption threshold for first-home buyers from K500,000 to K700,000, as it continues paying school project subsidies for an estimated 2.3 million students around the country.
Treasurer Ling-Stuckey says the HASP for 2025 will total K685 million, and altogether since its installation, will be worth K2.3 billion of assistance to struggling families in the country.
For the government’s Capital Investment budget in 2025, this will be at K10.3 billion.
This will boost the Pangu-led Government’s Public Investment Program worth K7.6 billion which will continue developing infrastructure in roads and bridges, wharves and jetties, airports and airstrips, power supply lines, and communication lines throughout the country.
Education and Health, both a big focus of the Marape-led Government, are being fairly supported. Education is getting K4.4 million – a 12 percent increase from last year; while Health will receive K2.7 billion – 9.4 percent increase.
Prime Minister Marape, in commending the budget, said the 2025 National Budget reflects his government’s continuing commitment to good fiscal policies aimed at driving the 13-year debt recovery strategy toward a more stabilized economy for Papua New Guinea beyond 2027.
He commended the Internal Revenue Commission and PNG Customs for their continued successes in collecting another round of high revenues to prop the 2025 budget.
“IRC continues to collect another record high revenue even without introducing any new tax. This is evidence of growth in our economy as shown in the positive results of the non-resource sector,” he said, adding that he was also pleased to note the 5.2 percent growth in the non-resource economy in 2025.
Marape commended Treasurer Ling-Stuckey and his team; Planning Minister Sir Ano Pala and his team; and Finance Minister Miki Kaeok and his team for their hard work in designing the budget.
""When I came into office in May 2019, I boldly stated in my maiden speech that I wanted Papua New Guinea to be a K200 billion economy by 2030. The 2025 Page 3 of 3 Budget is a testament to the progress we are making towards this goal,"" Prime Minister Marape said.
“The budget's key features include considerable economic growth, with non-resource growth reaching 5.2 percent from 4.5 percent in 2024, 4.7 percent in 2023, 5.9 percent in 2022, and 4.2 percent in 2021. This consistent growth in the non-resource economy demonstrates our nation’s resilience and economic strength as we move toward the envisioned K200 billion economies by 2030,” said Prime Minister Marape.","Politics, Trust",Politics,Trust
2025 Budget focuses on security,01/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2430,,,,"The 2025 Money Plan focuses on securing PNG through massive investment in police and security.

Treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey when presenting the 2025 Budget on Friday (November 29) said 2024 was a tough year with too many tears being shed due to massacres, domestic violence, and sorcery killings.
Out of these tears, he said the Government has taken action to secure both physical and economic security.
He further stated that the 2025 Budget is the money plan for the country’s 50th anniversary.
The highlight of the budget is the level of additional support the Government is providing to the Police and Defence forces.
This reflects the theme of the budget of “Securing PNG in 2025 and Beyond”.
Some of the highlights of the budget are:
- Securing PNG by massive investments in our police (providing more than the K700 million requested, including a 67% increase in goods and services and a 19% increase in their wages budget), our defence forces (a 15% increase in their wages budget, a 32% increase in goods and services and a 116% increase in capital) and our judiciary (a 25 % increase in operating costs) to build a safer, more secure society;
- Securing PNG by helping families with cost-of-living pressures with the fourth and largest Household Assistance Package of K685 million, bringing the total value over 4 years to K2,322 million, and including zero-rating GST for 13 essential goods;
- Securing PNG through investments in human and capital resources with the largest K28,357m  budget in PNG’s history, with record revenues of K25,408 million, while continuing with responsible budget repair of another K1,035 million cut in the deficit down, to K2,949 million
- Dropping the deficit to GDP ratio down from 8.9% in 2020 to one quarter that level at 2.2% in 2025 with a plan to return to a budget surplus by 2027 and the option of no debt by 2034;
- Securing PNG with massive investments into infrastructure with a record Public Investment Program of K7,616 million, 273% higher than the miserable K2,041 million PIP in 2018;
- Securing PNG with a focus on growth and jobs, with real non-resource growth expected to be 5.2% in 2025, creating the longest consecutive run of growth over 4% in PNG’s history, and formal sector jobs growth recovering, but still too low, of 2.9% in 2024;
- Securing PNG with massive investments in education of K4,435 million (a 12.0% increase) and in health of K2,768 million (a 9.4% increase); and
- Securing PNG through the priorities of the Marape-Rosso Government set out by Prime Minister Marape’s speech at the start of this 11th Parliament

Dr Billy backs Counter Terrorism Bill,01/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2427,,,,"Minister for National Defence and Emergency Services Dr. Billy Joesph MP, has commended the Government for the Passing of the Counter Terrorism Bill last Thursday 29th of November 2024.
“The passing of the Counter Terrorism Bill in Parliament is a significant step in ensuring a secured Papua New Guinea, and I commend the Government for their resolve to effectively protect the country against all forms of threat,” Minister Joseph said.
“I am in concurrence with the Minister for Police, Hon. Peter Tsiamalili Jnr, MP that the Bill is a significant step forward in our national security. As noted by Minister Tsiamalili Jnr in Parliament, the Bill enhances our operational effectiveness in countering domestic terrorism by consolidating resources and expertise.
“I want to put to the people of PNG that this Bill, through the establishment of the Counter Terrorism Joint Task Force, will improve coordination, command and control of our Police and Defence Force personnel jointly deployed in extreme security situations because it provides an avenue recognised by law for our command team at Murray Barracks to gel with the Police headquarter.”
He said the Government has been deploying PNGDF personnel to support the Police under the provisions of the Constitution and subsequent Acts of Parliament, however, those Acts did not establish a joint forces command of Police and Defence and the Bill now has put in place such a high-level body that will have senior members of the Police and PNGDF in one place giving command and coordinating operations.
Furthermore, Minister Joseph said the Bill also provides the necessary cover for the members of our disciplined forces who would be tasked to go after heavily armed domestic terrorists.
He said it would give them the confidence to decisively use reasonable lethal force in high-risk, fast-moving situations, knowing the Government and the Justice system have their back.
“Hence, I want to make it clear to the people of Papua New Guinea that as a Government, we are doing our job by putting laws and policies in place to counter the rising lawlessness and domestic terrorism experienced in our country. This Bill is a clear example that the Government is taking action and not just doing ideal talk,” Minister Joseph said.","Politics, Trust",Politics,Trust
Japan's embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba re-elected by politicians in runoff vote,12/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2202,,,,"Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has been re-elected by Japanese politicians, after his scandal-tarnished coalition lost its parliamentary majority in a lower house election last month.
Mr Ishiba took office six weeks ago and held a snap election on October 27, hoping to shore up his mandate as leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
After
a series of scandals,
voters in Japan punished the LDP at the ballot box, with the coalition's worst election loss in more than a decade.
Mr Ishiba's LDP and coalition partner Komeito won the biggest bloc of seats in the election but lost the majority held since 2012, leaving him beholden to small opposition parties to pass his policy agenda.
The 67-year-old will now run a fragile minority government as tensions rise with rivals China and North Korea, domestic pressure mounts to rein in the cost of living, and Japan's ally the United States prepares for a second Donald Trump presidency.
First runoff vote in decades decides leadership
Underlining that fragility, Monday's vote in parliament went to a runoff for the first time in 30 years, with no candidate able to muster majority support in the first round.
Mr Ishiba eventually secured 221 votes, well clear of his nearest challenger, former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda - the head of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party - but still short of a majority in the 465-seat lower house.

""In light of the very challenging election, we must transform into a national party that serves the people, that empathises with the peoples' struggles, their misery, and their joy,"" Mr Ishiba said.
His imminent challenge is compiling a supplementary budget for the fiscal year through March, under pressure from voters and opposition parties to raise spending on welfare and take steps to offset rising prices.
For approval he needs the backing of at least one opposition party, which is most likely to be the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) headed by Yuichiro Tamaki.
Mr Tamaki has held co-operation talks with Mr Ishiba, but DPP politicians did not vote for Mr Ishiba to stay on as prime minister. Mr Tamaki is also in a precarious position after admitting on Monday to an
extra-marital affair
revealed in a tabloid magazine.
Mr Ishiba now has to prepare for a slate of international engagements, including a summit of the Group of 20 big economies in Brazil later this month.
Last month Shigeru Ishiba led his coalition to its worst election loss in more than a decade. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)
He is also trying to arrange a stopover in the US to meet US president-elect Trump. The Japanese leader spoke to Mr Trump for the first time on Thursday in a ""friendly"" five-minute conversation during which he congratulated him on his election victory.
Some Japanese officials fear Trump might again hit Tokyo with protectionist trade measures and revive demands for it to pay more for the cost of stationing US forces there.
These issues were largely smoothed over in Trump's first term, from 2017 to 2021, by the close ties between the president-elect and Japan's then-premier, Shinzo Abe - a bond that Mr Ishiba seems keen to re-establish.
Japan will hold elections next year for the less powerful upper house, where the ruling coalition's slim majority could also be at risk if Mr Ishiba cannot revive public trust roiled by a scandal over unrecorded donations to politicians.

Opposition to file new VONC notice in November,27/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1609,,,,"The Vote of No Confidence against Prime Minister James Marape is far from over with the opposition planning to submit another notice in the November sitting.
Member of opposition and former Prime Minister, Peter O’Neill revealed this in an exclusive interview with TVWan Online on Thursday. He said this will be their last attempt to again test the grounds on which the current PM stands, given the current economic climate of the country.
Section 145 of the Constitution clearly indicates when a Vote of No Confidence should be taken against a sitting Prime Minister. It states that a VONC should be done within the first four years of the reign of the current government. Hence, the VONC is still open for members of opposition as long as it is within the time frame set by the constitution.
Having just lost their first attempt to remove the member for Tari Pori James Marape as Prime Minister early this month, the opposition has not lost hope.
“We will definitely be putting one up in November, but that will be the final one because we are not gonna create instability for the country, we want people to make the real choice. Do they want Marape still in there, continuously doing these corrupt deals and stealing and carrying on for the next two to three years? I hope you will celebrate 50 years like that in 2025,” O’Neill said.
O’Neill says the opposition believes that the numbers Marape now has need to be tested again, comparing the numbers Marape had just after the elections, and the ones he had in the recent VONC.
“Now when we have a situation like that, he was elected by the same members of parliament who voted for him as Prime Minister after the elections. Last vote count, he only had 75 – that’s a big difference. That means one-third of your parliament has no faith in you. So obviously, there are more disgruntled members who are unhappy rightfully so.”
When asked who their PM nominee would be, O’Neill said that was something for the opposition caucus to decide.
“That’s the prerogative of the caucus. Caucus is made out of the number of the number of members who are in opposition and those who are wanting a change so that will be determined at the right time.”

Marape thanks Coalition Partners,12/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1409,,,,"Prime Minister James Marape has expressed gratitude to all Coalition Partners for their unwavering support ahead of today’s Vote of No Confidence (VONC) in the National Parliament.
On the eve of the highly anticipated vote, Prime Minister Marape publicly acknowledged the crucial backing of several key political leaders and their parties. He extended his thanks to the United Resources Party (URP) and its leader William Duma, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and its Leader Powes Parkop, People’s First Party (PFP) and its Leader Richard Maru, People’s Party (PP) and its Leader Sir Peter Ipatas, the National Alliance and its leader Walter Schnaubelt, PNG Party and its leader Belden Namah, People’s Movement for Change and its leader Garry Juffa, Melanesian Liberal Party and its leader Dr Allan Marat, and Melanesian Alliance Party and its leader Joseph Yopyyopy.
The Prime Minister highlighted the strength of the coalition government, which consists of his ruling PANGU Pati’s 48 members of parliament (MPs) and an additional 29 MPs from the Coalition Partners.
This unity gives the government a total of 77 MPs as they prepare for today’s VONC, providing a solid base of support that Prime Minister Marape says will see them through this period of political uncertainty.
“I thank all these coalition partners for their continuous support since this VONC drama started earlier this year,” Marape stated, reflecting on the ongoing challenges posed by the political maneuvering surrounding the vote.
“Their loyalty and dedication to our government and our shared vision for the country have been unwavering.
“This week, unlike in many political situations before, we did not confine or pressure our leaders. I have great respect for their freedom, allowing them to come and go without duress, intimidation, or influence—acting entirely of their own free will and choice.
“Last week, as soon as the VONC was lodged, I informed them that they were free to make their own decisions. To date, we have not lost a single MP to the Opposition, which demonstrates that the trust I placed in them has been fully reciprocated.

The parliamentary wing Members include Deputy Leader and Member for Talasea, Freddie Reu Kumai, Member for Jimi, Wake Goi and Enga Governor Sir Peter Ipatas.

“Dr. Lino is the parliamentary leader of People’s Party and a leader with credibility and we respect his decisions to resign as Minister for Health,” Sir Ipatas said.
“However, the three of us have resolved this morning to remain in government to provide political stability and continuity as a political party,” said the Governor.
“We continue to throw our support behind Prime Minister James Marape but with conditions for government to focus on addressing some of the pressing issues faced by the country and its people.
“The issues of escalating law and order problems, corruption, lack of basic social services of health and education, decline in the economy, increase in prices of goods and services, uncontrolled public spending and inefficiencies and weakness in the public administration are issues of our concern.
“We have raised those time and again and earlier in the week the same concerns were raised with PM Marape and Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso to seriously look into addressing them.”
“These are issues that we cannot deny as a party, however, those can be addressed when there is political stability in government rather a continued political play in Waigani, which also contributes to some of the issues,” Sir Ipatas stressed.
“The People’s Party was an integral part of the Prime Minister, James Marape’s Pangu Pati coalition government at the initial stages in 2019 and will continue to maintain the support.
“We as a party believe in political stability and continuity in government, therefore, we remain committed to support the government that we are an initial partner.
“Like, others we too disagree with some of the decisions and actions of the government, and we have raised to the prime minister in our earlier conversations,” Ipatas said.
“We would like to inform the People’s Party Convention, that include, our party executives, provincial coordination, sponsors, financial members, supporters and the people that we will remain and support this government.
“We will continue to raise our concerns as a party and for the people that we represent and the country as a whole. We have to it within government.”
“We would like to rest assure our party people that the decision we are taking as a party is to show that we are serious about the concerns and we believe there would be changes to address the issues faced today,” Ipatas added.","Politics, Trust",Politics,Trust
Lae waste disposal delayed,05/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1309,,,,"Rubbish collection in Lae city, Morobe Province, has been delayed.
The Lae Chamber of Commerce and Industry explained that there are two reasons why waste collection has paused.
The first reason is the change in route and collection schedule for the contracted garbage collectors.
“This was changed, which caused a misunderstanding with the contractors,” clarified LCCI president, John Byrne.
“This is being addressed and will resolve soon.
“Secondly, the Second Seven Dump access has been blocked by roadworks, which is causing a back up of waste collection. An alternate route has been established but notice not fully provided yet.”
LCCI further cautioned against the unauthorised disposal of wastes on customary land belonging to the people of Butibam.
“An unauthorised dump is being facilitated at Hengali, Butibam, and several unidentified contractors are disposing waste in this area on a local landowners’ property,” said Byrne.
“This creates a major health concern as the risk of contaminating the water sources, including bore water holes used for cooking, drinking and washing.
“Three business houses have been identified for allegedly disposing waste and refuse in this location and LCA Department of Health officials will visit their operation to assess the accuracy of this claim and if proven, take necessary action.
“The landowner will also have had notice served instructing immediate closure of the illegal dumpsite.
“Please do not dump rubbish other than through the authorised collection and disposal methods.
“LCCI is in communication with LCA to have the collection service restored and the Second Seven Dump accessible as soon as possible.”","Local, Disgust",Local,Disgust

He made this statement today after Speaker Job Pomat and Clerk Kala Aufa confirmed that the fifth VONC motion, submitted by the Opposition, met all necessary requirements. It was confirmed by the Private Business Committee (PBC) with MP Paita nominated as the challenger.
“I offer my congratulations (to) Paita becoming the Opposition’s nominee and appreciate the Opposition for getting the forms filled correctly as required by Section 145 of our Constitution and Section 130 of the Standing Orders,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Tomorrow morning, the name will be placed on parliament notice and by operation of law, parliament will adjourn to next Thursday when the motion is voted upon.
""Prime minister-ship is not my birthright; it belongs to our people. In a parliament of equals, MPs will decide who is best to serve in that office. I am here by operation of Section 63, invitation of the Organic Law On Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates (OLIPPAC), to form government because PANGU Pati, under my watch, returned 39 MPs after the 2022 National General Election. However, the Constitution allows for VONC after 18 months, and since February this year, our nation has been impeded by those who want to lead or form government. It’s good that we now address the VONC so the country, investors, and development partners can have clarity on national leadership.""
“I have had the privilege of serving as the chief servant of PNG for five years now. It has never been an easy task, but I don’t blame anyone. I take full responsibility as the person at the top of the chain of command. If I remain Prime Minister next Thursday, we will continue the restorations and reconstructions we have pursued since May 30, 2019.
“This constitutional process will allow MPs to decide whether Paita can address the challenges our large country faces now and into the future more effectively than I can.""
“I ask the people of all backgrounds in our country to remain united as leaders consider who will best guide us into our 50th anniversary next year and beyond. Politics is temporary, but our aim must always be a better country. I once again commend Paita; he is talented, and I pray that God’s will for our country prevails.”
“To all my supporters, family, and PANGU followers: let us not take personal offense. Leaders are bound by the dictates of our country’s Constitution and God-given freedom of choice to decide for themselves. So I ask you all to respect Paita and the Opposition. A strong opposition is good for our democracy.”","Politics, Anticipation",Politics,Anticipation
Opposition launches Alternative Policies,02/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1274,,,,"The Opposition yesterday launched their  Strategic Policy Action Plan, detailing what the Alternate Government will deliver to Papua New Guinea as a truly effective government.
The alternate Plan is the result of an exhaustive review that outlines what the Alternate Government will implement as an effective government.
MP for Abau, Sir Puka Temu said the alternate policies are not a mere declaration but a solemn commitment, and they are fully prepared to see it through.
“We will reveal the full details in the coming weeks, but the following is a snapshot of the key policies we intend to share with our people.”
The first main policy is restoring Fiscal Discipline. The Opposition claimed that the current Government has utterly failed in fiscal discipline.
“This is evident in the unmanageable budget deficits, reckless spending on projects with zero economic returns, inflated contracts, and the continued unlawful transfer of funds without regard for budgetary appropriation and lawful processes.
“The Alternate Government will immediately restore fiscal discipline through the following decisive policy actions:
a)	Cut spending to reduce the budget deficit;
b)	Eradicate waste and prevent cost overruns;
c)	Stop unlawful transfers and abuse of appropriations;
d)	Review all contracts and office leases to curb inflated processes;
e)	Halt projects that offer no economic returns or socio-economic justification; and
f)	Eliminate functional duplications and overlaps in the public service.
Reducing the Alarming Public Debt Situation is the second main alterbate policy.
The total public debt has ballooned to an estimated K100 billion from K29 billion in 2019. This includes contingencies, arrears, SOE debts, and State Guarantees.
Sir Puka said the Marape Government has recklessly borrowed close to K71 billion through domestic and external sources in just 3.5 years, amounting to a staggering K20.3 billion per year.
“This was done by deliberately amending the Fiscal Responsibility Act, raising the debt-to GDP limit from 35% to 60%. The Government deceived the people, claiming this amendment was necessary to repair the budget.
“But let us be clear: the Government engaged in a massive borrowing spree, followed by a reckless spending spree, without any consideration for the devastating consequences on our economy and our people. Now, the debt-to-GDP stands at a staggering 58%.”
He said the reality is that PNG now faces a grave debt crisis.
“If we do not urgently curb this out-of-control borrowing, PNG is at serious risk of defaulting on its debt repayments, which would be an economic  catastrophe for our country. We need only look at other countries for examples of the devastation this can cause.
“We should be more than concerned—we should be alarmed.
“In real terms, there has been no economic growth. The average real GDP growth over the last 4 years is a dismal 0.5%. No economic growth means no increase in tax revenues. So, how is this massive debt going to be repaid?
“Common sense dictates that a K71 billion loan should have resulted in substantial growth, including job and income creation. Yet, this has not happened. There is no growth at all.
“So, the pressing question is, where did James Marape and his Government squander these billions of kina? Where have they invested these funds?
“Our people deserve to know how the K71 billion was spent.”
Sir Puka said the Alternate Government is committed to uncovering the truth.
He said that is why they will take drastic policy actions from their first day in office, including:
a)	Reducing our debt-to-GDP ratio to 35% by 2029 by amending the Fiscal Responsibility
Act;
b)	Halting the reckless printing of money (quantitative easing);
c)	Banning all further borrowings by SOEs;
d)	Ceasing off-budget borrowings;
e)	Ending State guarantees to SOEs and contractors;
f)	Lowering the Kina Facility Rate (KFR); and
g)	Slashing government spending and the national deficit.
Addressing the Foreign Currency Shortage in the country is the other alternative policy addressed by the Opposition.
The leaders said the foreign currency shortage is severely crippling our country.
“As a small, import dependent economy, we rely heavily on imports for business, fuel, construction materials, pharmaceuticals, school supplies, household goods, and food. This shortage is fueling inflation, and the cost of nearly everything has surged by 30% to 100%.
“The foreign currency shortage is a direct result of the Marape Government’s failure to attract Foreign Direct Investment, the needless and prolonged closure of the Porgera Gold Mine, the non-drawdown of foreign aid, the continued decline in exports due to the lack of effective policy interventions, indecisiveness regarding the Papua LNG, Wafi-Golpu Gold Mine, and Pasca Gas projects, and a lack of control over the influx of non-essential, unregulated, and cheap imports.”
The Alternate Government has recognized this critical problem and will immediately implement the following policy measures:
a)	Mobilize foreign earnings from our key exporters and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs);
b)	Permit foreign currency accounts to be operated by key exporters and SOEs;
c)	Restructure import content to prioritize essentials over non-essentials;
d)	Overhaul and reform foreign exchange regulation;
e)	Review and strengthen the current foreign exchange regime and policy;
f)	Develop a robust Foreign Exchange Risk Management Strategy;
g)	Ensure the delivery of critical economic projects, including Papua LNG, Wafi-Golpu Gold, P’nyang LNG, and Pasca Oil, within 12 months; and
h)	Attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) through targeted tax incentives and the reduction of unnecessary regulation and red tape.

LLG presidents oppose MP’s decision,30/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1248,,,,"The decision by Morobe’s Member for Bulolo, Sam Basil Jnr, to reclaim machinery and vehicles acquired from 2007 to 2022, has been met with staunch resistance.
Local Level Government presidents of Watut, Mumeng and Buang claim the MP does not have the right to retrieve all Bulolo District Development Authority vehicles.
In a press statement dated August 7th, Basil Jnr outlined that the Bulolo District Development Authority is undertaking an asset and stock verification of assets procured under the leadership of his late father, and former Bulolo MP Sam Basil.
The first term MP further said: “I have provided a list of state assets and names of persons in possession, or who will know its whereabouts, to the PPC – Morobe and the Northen Mobile Group to assist the district to interview the persons holding onto the equipment and vehicles to return it.
“The Bulolo DDA will distribute to Wau-Waria DDA what is available and to write off those that are genuine.
“Any person who thinks that he is entitled to the state assets must show genuine transfer
documents or official correspondence giving entitlement.”
In response to the MP’s directive, Watut LLG President, Waka Daimon, who had served under the late Basil Snr, said the transfer of ownership was made prior to the young MP’s term.
“Machineries were purchased and given to each LLG, vehicles were bought and given to presidents and at the same time, the late Basil Snr bought vehicles and gave to the people of Bulolo district, such as cooperatives, support vehicles and police vehicles too. All of these were under the late Sam Basil.”
Daimon said over 150 vehicles were bought during the tenure of the late former MP, using funds from the different government ministries that he was in charge of, including the Bulolo DDA, National Planning & Monitoring and Commerce and Industry.
Daimon said after three years, the ownership of the vehicles was transferred to Bulolo’s senior public servants and supporters of the late MP.
“We have the documents to prove our ownership while the machineries are under the names of the local level government councillors,” he stated.
“The decision was already made regarding the ownership and he (Jnr) went ahead and revoked all of it.”
Mumeng LLG president, Kekeng Amos, further outlined that the LLG presidents have been sidelined from the DDA board. This is in breach of the District Development Authority Act 2014, which states that a DDA board shall consist of the MP, who shall be the Chairperson of the Board; and the heads of LLGs in the district; and not more than three other members appointed by the MP, representing the open electorate.

Pomio MP to move to govt,29/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1237,,,,"East New Britain’s Member for Pomio Open, Elias Kapavore, has made the decision to return to the government side, following requests by the Local Level Government (LLG) presidents of Pomio District.
The MP had defected to the Opposition side three months ago, after joining the ruling coalition mid last year.
However, the continuous support from the Marape-Rosso led government has seen development taking shape in all the seven LLGs of Pomio District and this has prompted the concerned LLG presidents to plead with their political head to reconsider his decision.
Making the announcement last night (Aug 28), Kapavore said he agreed with the sentiments raised by the presidents for Sinivit and Melkoi LLGs on the fact that, of the number of districts that the Prime Minister has supported, Pomio is a major recipient of projects.
“After joining PANGU Pati, we have seen a lot of support especially with the connection of the missing link along the south coast corridor, which has been overlooked by previous governments. Also, the PM has visited the district twice within that short period of time,” he said.
Apart from that major road connectivity along the south coast, there are a number of bridges delivered to the district; some have been opened while others are under construction to link up wards and LLGs to the headquarters at Palmalmal, and to the provincial capital of Kokopo city.
“We have built four bridges in the district and now we have materials for a 100-metre bridge for Melkoi River and others like Tolo River. So, to respond to the requests by the LLG presidents and the people of Pomio District, I want to make known my intention to ask the Prime Minister to join PANGU,” he said.
He said PANGU Pati was the founding political party of the country’s government and has been the party for a lot of political leaders from Pomio District and East New Britain province in the past.
After his defection to the Opposition this year, Sinivit LLG President, Boniface Gerep, made the first appeal and this was followed by Melkoi LLG President, Thomas Osa, just recently.
“Apart from the bridges, we also got support to purchase the ‘MV Pomio 2’ vessel that is servicing the people along the south coast to the western part of the New Britain Island,” said Osa.
He expressed their satisfaction with Kapavore’s response, and gave the assurance that they will continue to give their support.","Politics, Trust",Politics,Trust
Treasurer meets with Australian counterpart,26/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1201,,,,"Treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey has met with the Australian Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, during a recent visit to Canberra.
The meeting was an opportunity to share views on how best to respond to the extraordinary challenges facing the two countries in these uncertain times.
“One key area of discussion was how best to deal with the cost of living pressures facing our struggling families.
“PNG introduced a historic Household Assistance Package, now worth K1,597 million, in response to the cost of living pressures flowing from the Ukraine-Russian war.
Ling-Stuckey said the family support is continuing, with the 2024 budget providing school project fee relief, saving families K220 for each student in secondary schools, K60 for each student in primary schools and K200 in technical colleges.
“This program will benefit more than 1.5 million children.  PNG workers are also benefiting from permanently lifting the level at which any income tax is paid from K480 per fortnight up to K769 per fortnight,” the Treasurer said in a statement.
Adding that this was a tax reduction of over K63 per fortnight for anyone still paying income tax.
“In Australia, income tax cuts have also been offered. Australia’s much more comprehensive social security system also allows targeted initiatives in areas such as rent assistance, student debt relief, reduced medical costs and energy bill relief.
“We discussed how our budgets were going, as well as views for the future. Both of our governments are targeting budget repair, all balanced with the ongoing needs of our communities,” said Ling-Stuckey.
Also discussed was the world economic outlook.
Ling-Stuckey said as commodity exporting nations, both nations’ budget outlooks will be influenced by movements in international commodity prices and other uncertainties.
The Treasurer, on behalf of the Government expressed gratitude to Australians for their support in responding to extraordinary global headwinds over recent times.
He said PNG has benefitted greatly from being able to access part of Australia’s triple A credit rating subject to limits and conditions.
“This means we have been able to fund infrastructure projects and critical health and education programs at a much lower rate than if we went to international capital markets on our terms. PNG is repaying these funds, with interest, at no direct cost to the Australian budget.”","Politics, Trust",Politics,Trust
PM welcomes planned VONC,25/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1177,,,,"Prime Minister James Marape today welcomed the Opposition's planned no-confidence vote against his government, urging them to properly fill out the vote-of-no-confidence form before submitting it to the Parliamentary Private Business Committee (PBC).
“We welcome the challenge by the Opposition. Our Constitution provides for a vote of no confidence, and the Opposition is welcome to move one. The prime ministership is not my birthright,” Prime Minister Marape said.
Prime Minister Marape in a press conference held this morning further highlighted the importance of the upcoming parliamentary proceedings, noting that Members of Parliament will assess the leadership abilities of potential alternate prime ministers when the time comes.
“Section 145 provides for the Opposition to move a vote-of-no-confidence, however, I urge them to get it right this time and not repeat the mistake of not properly filling out the vote-of-no-confidence form as they have done five times already,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
The Opposition has been urged to ensure that the form is correctly completed by September 3, citing the significance of upcoming national events such as the Pope’s visit on September 6 and the independence celebrations on September 16.
He also mentioned the planned parliamentary tribute to the late Central Bougainville MP, Simon Dumarinu, on September 3.
“Parliament is sitting for two weeks, so I urge the Opposition to fill in the vote-of-no-confidence form properly this time. The PBC sits on Wednesdays, so fill in the form properly before 4:06 pm on Tuesday, September 3. On Thursday, it goes on notice, and we come back the following Thursday and deal with it.”

“I congratulate the Honorable Bryan Kramer on this success, and we welcome him back to Government.
“I commend his maturity and resilience. Without protesting publicly and no matter how long it has taken, he has deployed the use of our country’s courts to exercise his Constitutional rights.
“The Honourable Kramer represents a class of politicians who fight for what they believe is right. They are not in politics for the love of money or fame but there to do what is right for their people.
“I am blessed to have him in my coalition among members who share this same view.
“Since we assembled in 2019, the majority of us have remained together, united in our common cause to serve our people. Kramer is one of these leaders. “I am glad he is back. I welcome him and will be supporting him in his role as Member for Madang and whatever other role Government gives him,” said PM Marape.

Tomuriesa welcomes Haiveta to Opposition,19/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1097,,,,"Leader of the Opposition, Douglas Tomuriesa has commended the decision by Gulf Provincial Member, Sir Chris Haiveta to join the Opposition.
Tomuriesa said the decision is respectable given the connections Sir Chris has with PANGU Pati but demonstrates that political affiliations must never be at the sacrifice of national wellbeing.
“On behalf of the Opposition, I welcome Sir Chris to the Opposition and acknowledge his commitment to supporting a greater cause to collectively save this country,” Tomuriesa said.
“Sir Chris brings a wealth of experience, knowledge and capability to the Opposition, and we look forward to consulting him in the coming weeks before Parliament.
“It is never an easy decision for a member of parliament to switch their political affiliations, and Sir Chris is a testament to that.
“With a respectable position as a senior PANGU leader and a senior governor in government, Sir Chris had much to consider before making his decision.”
Meantime, Prime Minister Marape in an official statement emphasized that Sir Chris along with other leaders, has the constitutional freedom to change political affiliations; and that he welcomes such decisions.","Politics, Trust",Politics,Trust
Marape acknowledges Haiveta’s move,19/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1093,,,,"Prime Minister James Marape has acknowledged the decision of Gulf Provincial MP, Sir Chris Haiveta to leave the Government and join the Opposition, affirming Sir Chris’s right to make independent decisions.
Sir Chris officially announced his move over to the Opposition in a press conference held on Sunday 18th of August.
In acknowledging the move, Prime Minister Marape in a statement said every leader, including Sir Chris, is entitled to his or her own opinions and decisions.
“I have no issue with him announcing today that he is leaving Government and joining Opposition,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
“He is a veteran of Papua New Guinea politics, including the last five years, where we have tried to manage the economy in very trying circumstances. We have tried our best to share resources equally to all parts of the country, including Sir Chris’ Gulf, as he knows only too well,” Prime Minister Marape said.
However, the Prime Minister also urged Sir Chris to be forthright about his reasons for joining the Opposition amidst the current political environment.
“Everyone knows the vote-of-no-confidence is on, so he should get real, and tell us the real reasons why he is leaving Government and joining Opposition rather than hiding behind the camouflage of equal distribution of resources,” Marape remarked.
Prime Minister Marape emphasised that Sir Chris, along with other leaders, has the constitutional freedom to change political affiliations and that he welcomes such decisions.
“Sir Chris is free, by virtue of Section 50 of the Constitution, to move around. He, and all leaders who don’t like my style of leadership, are free to do so.
“Sir Chris is also a member of the Private Business Committee and I urge him, and Opposition MPs, not to make mistake after mistake as they have been doing five times this year when they filed for VONC.”
The Prime Minister further clarified the procedural expectations for the Opposition MPs.
“Fill in the form properly, bring it to Parliament, and Sir Chris is on the Private Business Committee to witness compliance to Standing Order requirements. If all things are done properly, we can then test numbers on the floor of Parliament,” he said.
Despite the current political developments, Prime Minister Marape expressed confidence in the support of the majority of the PANGU Pati MPs.
“Most MPs are not stupid and carefully watching all this ‘Alternate Prime Minister’ game being played by the Opposition,” he observed.
The Prime Minister also noted that Sir Chris was not originally part of the PANGU team that formed the Government in 2019 and suggested that his departure makes no difference.
“That said, Sir Chris was never a part of the Pangu team that formed Government in 2019, being a one-man party until we reined him in just before the 2022 National General Election.
“If he does not find comfort in my leadership, he should leave, and the PANGU caucus will decide his membership with the Party,” Marape said.","Politics, Trust",Politics,Trust
Court dismisses Opposition’s application,06/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/937,,,,"The five-men bench consisting Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika, Justice Gavara Nanu, Justice Derek Hartshorn, Justice Panuel Mogish and Justice David Cannings, ruled in favor of the second intervener, the Attorney General and dismissed the application by the Opposition seeking declaration and orders of interpretation on the motion of no confidence in the prime minister.
The applicant argued that the actions of the parliament were in breach of ss 111 (right to introduce bills etc), 135 (questions as to membership etc) and 145 (motions of no confidence) of the Constitution and that the Court should order under s 155(4) of the Constitution the Clerk of the Parliament to place the notice of motion of no confidence as the first term of business on the next sitting day of the Parliament and the Speaker to recall the Parliament within seven days for the motion of no confidence to be voted upon.
Speaker of Parliament, Job Pomat and the Attorney-General, Pila Niningi were granted leave on June 18, 2024 to join the proceedings as first and second intervener respectively.
The second intervener on June 26, 2024 filed a notice of objection to competency of the application and on July 25, 2024 filed an amended notice of objection to competency of the application. The court heard the argument on the amended notice of objection to competency of the application and ruled that:
1.	the application is non-compliant with Order 4, rules 1, 3 and form 1 of the Supreme Court Rules as it does not request a proper interpretation of any Constitutional Law;
2.	the application seeks interpretations of the Standing Orders of the National Parliament, which are not Constitutional Laws;
3.	the application fails to plead material facts;
4.	the application is an exercise in futility as the primary decision it seeks to impugn is the decision of the Private Business Committee of the Parliament to reject the notice of motion of no confidence that was submitted on May 29, 2024, which decision has been superseded by other events;
5.	the application is based on alleged breaches of the Standing Orders by the Private Business Committee and the Parliament, but such alleged breaches are non-justiciable under s 134 of the Constitution;
6.	the application pleads factual matters when it only is required to plead the proper interpretation and application of provisions of the Constitutional Laws; and
7.	the application ignores the fact that the Private Business Committee's decision to reject the notice of motion was superseded by a decision of the Speaker to overrule the Committee's decision and the fact that the Parliament decided to overrule the Speaker's decision and did so in the absence of the Opposition members of the Parliament, led by the applicant, who walked out of the chamber and denied themselves the opportunity of debating the matters before the Parliament.
The court found no substance in five of the ground of objection but upheld two of the ground of objections 2 and 5.
The Chief Justice, when reading out the ruling, said the court is satisfied and has no jurisdiction to entertain the application and the objection to competency is upheld while the entire proceedings will be dismissed.","Politics, Trust",Politics,Trust
Supreme Court to Decide on Date of Substantive Matter,29/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/818,,,,"A five-man Supreme Court Bench will give its decision on the application by Attorney-General Pila Niningi to set aside orders for the Opposition’s substantive hearing for August 1, 2024.
Mr Niningi, who is the first intervener in the matter, will await the decision of his application which will be handed down on Wednesday, July 31, 2024.
The application seeks to set aside the orders of Justice Derek Hartshorn, who whilst presiding as a single judge on July 19 ordered that the full hearing for substantive arguments would take place on August 1.
The Supreme Court today having heard arguments from both sides, has reserved its decision for this Wednesday.
This is to determine whether to set aside the decision of Judge Hartshorn to have the substantive matter heard on August 1 or not.
The application filed by Attorney General's lawyers aims to set aside the orders set for August 1, and vacate the hearing of the substantive application on that day, arguing for the orders to be set aside.
However, the Opposition’s lawyer objected the application, arguing that there are no good reasons, and the hearing should proceed.
Meantime, Deputy Opposition Leader and Chuave MP James Nomane reiterated that the Opposition remains committed to the case, and looked forward to the outcome ahead.
Mr Nomane challenged the Prime Minister and the government to stop the delay tactics and deal with the vote of no confidence head on.
""If you claim that you have the numbers, if you are confident that you're doing the right thing, by the country, then why are we playing all these games, and why are we even in court? Test your numbers,"" Mr Nomane said.

“We will have to re-do our polling schedules, due to the changes in the dates of the elections. The deferral will also give us time to properly prepare our logistics and recruitment of polling and counting officials. We also have the ward roll enrolment data processing to be completed.”
Voivoi said after data processing, preliminary ward rolls would be sent out to wards and LLGs for verification of the names of eligible voters.
He has assured that the province is prepared to conduct the LLG elections this year, with an estimated budget of K5 million.

Marape arrived at Henada Airport this morning, 6.20am (local time), accompanied by his wife, Rachael Marape; Minister for Foreign Affairs, Justin Tkatchenko; and other government officials.

Positive economic outlook for PNG: IMF,15/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/640,,,,"Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed an International Monetary Fund (IMF) report indicating that Papua New Guinea’s economic outlook remains positive.
The IMF report, released recently, forecasts that growth is expected to increase to 4.6 percent in 2024 from 2.9 percent in 2023.
This growth is supported by the resumption of activities at the Porgera gold mine and favorable commodity prices.
The report also noted that inflation is expected to normalise towards its historical average of around 5 percent.
Additionally, Papua New Guinea’s gross international reserves stood comfortably at US$3.9 billion at the end of 2023, or 6.6 months of total imports, providing space to continue implementing central banking reforms.
“There are more than enough positive messages on our economic path forward,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Whilst we are not there yet, and still have a lot more work to do, at least our fiscal consolidation is noted and the IMF works with our plan, not imposing on us.
“We have not factored projects like Wafi-Golpu, Papua LNG, Pasca LNG, P’nyang, and PNG LNG post-2026 into our economic recovery model. Remember, our policy is to get above 55 percent in total economic value of all these projects put together.”
Prime Minister Marape emphasised that the economic situation is not as dire as critics portray.
“Our Treasurer, Ian Ling-Stuckey, under our government, has a clear sight of debt reduction to zero by 2033, and a stronger K200-billion plus economy.
“We can talk about anything and everything, but if our economy is not big and strong, we will not have money to do the job. I urge our people to read professional reports done by professionals rather than the rantings of unqualified people on social media.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
IMF completes Second review of PNG’s fund support program,15/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/637,,,,"The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the Second Reviews of Papua New Guinea’s Fund-supported program last Friday.
The 38-month Extended Credit Facility and Extended Fund Facility (ECF/EFF) arrangements, approved on March 22, 2023, support the authorities’ reforms to address long-standing structural impediments to inclusive growth.
This review completion allows for the immediate disbursement of SDR 94.75 million (about US$125 million or K482m) toward budget support, bringing total disbursements under the program so far to SDR 226 million (about US$299 million or K1.15b).
Papua New Guinea’s economic outlook remains positive. Growth is expected to increase in 2024 to 4.6 percent from 2.9 percent in 2023, supported by the resumption of activities at the Porgera gold mine and by favorable commodity prices.
Inflation is expected to normalize towards its historical average of around 5 percent.
Gross international reserves stood comfortably at US$ 3.9 bn at end-2023, or 6.6 months of total imports, providing space to continue implementing central banking reforms.
In completing the review, the Executive Board also approved a waiver of applicability for three end-June 2024 performance criteria, for which data are not yet available.
The medium-term outlook is positive but subject to risks. On the upside the start of the construction of major resource projects, which are not yet in the baseline scenario, could yield additional economic growth in the medium run, as well as gains in exports and fiscal revenues once they are operational.
On the downside, Papua New Guinea is vulnerable to both domestic and external shocks, exacerbated by public debt, FX shortages, and capacity constraints that impact the government’s ability to formulate and implement economic stabilization and development policies.
Papua New Guinea is also vulnerable to the consequences of climate change and particularly exposed to severe climate-related disasters.
Program performance has been satisfactory, with the authorities displaying a continued commitment to reforms. All end-December 2023 quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets were met, and most structural benchmarks have been implemented.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

“They are the biggest consumer of beef in the world. My focus has been on the export of agricultural produce to Asia, including Indonesia, given their huge population.
“That is why I am taking with me Livestock Minister Seki Agisa, Oil Palm Minister Francis Maneke, International Trade and Investment Minister Richard Maru, and Foreign Affairs Minister Justin Tkatchenko to this important meeting.
""I highly value the Annual Leaders’ Dialogue with our nearest neighbor as it serves as a mechanism to effectively coordinate and measure progress of our existing bilateral relations with Indonesia, and I refer to President Widodo’s description that, 'You can choose your friend but not your partner’.”
From Indonesia, Prime Minister Marape heads to Japan for the Pacific Islands Leaders’ Meeting (PALM) Summit from 16th - 18th July 2024.

Hartshorn adjourned the matter to June 18th for a hearing.
The lawyer representing the Opposition, Philip Tabuchi said because the Speaker and the Attorney General were named as interested parties to the reference, the Court has ordered them to file and serve the replications to intervene in the case.
“The Speaker and the Attorney General are not automatic parties they have to file to justify why they should be joined to the case.
“These are just basic standard procedural matters that the court has turned its mind to in this case,” Tabuchi said.
Meanwhile, the opposition is seeking an interpretation of the Speaker’s decision on the motion of a Vote of No Confidence.
Among the reliefs that they are seeking is for Parliament to be recalled.","Politics, Anticipation",Politics,Anticipation

Opposition concerned over vacuum in police command,12/03/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/189,,,,"Shadow Minister for Internal Security and Health, Johnson Wapunai, has expressed concern over the effects of a delay in the appointment of senior police officers in the provincial command positions.
Wapunai said that Central, Enga and East Sepik Provinces currently do not have Provincial Police Commanders following the announcement of the transfers of existing ones.
“There is now a huge command vacuum in those three provinces”, he said.
Wapunai said that what is more alarming is that experienced and competent senior officers from the Central Command in headquarters are being transferred to smaller provinces which is creating a vacuum in the national command and control structure.
He said: “It does not make sense to transfer senior police officers to lower level Command positions. This is tantamount to a demotion for these officers.
“I hope these transfers are not politically motivated so that competent senior officers are isolated or denied opportunities to be promoted to other senior positions in the police hierarchy.”
He called on the Police Minister and the Prime Minister to ensure that the Police Commissioner is not influenced in doing his Constitutional duties.","Politics, Fear",Politics,Fear

VONC Process,13/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/75,,,,"Parliament resumes tomorrow at 2pm.
This round of sitting is critical as the 18-month grace period for the Marape-led government has expired and the door is open for a motion to be moved for a Vote of No Confidence (VONC) against Prime Minister James Marape.
A VONC only takes place when a motion is filed before the Private Business Committee (PBC) who must sit and vet the motion to ensure all criteria is met.
According to the VONC process, if the opposition files the VONC tomorrow, then the PBC meets on Wednesday and deliberates on the motion.

The PBC is comprised mostly governors and is chaired by the Hela Governor, Philip Undialu, SHP Governor William Powi as the deputy. Manus Governor Charlie Benjamin, East Sepik Governor Allan Bird and Western Governor Toboi Yoto are members.
If the motion is filed tomorrow, the committee will check to see if the name of the alternate Prime Minister is listed, if the motion is seconded and if the motion has signatures of at least 12 to 15 MPs or more.
Once the PBC is satisfied that the required procedures have been followed, the motion is then listed on the notice paper. The following day the Speaker announces to Parliament that a vote of no confidence has been moved against the PM.
Parliament is then adjourned for a week and then proceeds with the vote of no confidence after that week.

"Bird, Basil Jr, Samban resign from Gov’t",13/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/50,,,,"East Sepik Governor, Allan Bird with Bulolo MP Sam Basil Jr alongside the newly elected MP for Wewak Stanley Samban announced their resignation from the Marape-Rosso Government and have joined the Opposition.
The MPs made their announcement in a press conference at Dream Inn Hotel in Port Moresby yesterday.
Governor Bird when giving his speech said his move was to see a change in the Government.
“I will not be the lookout, standing guard while the riches of this country are plundered. My conscience will not allow it.
“I remained in government hoping that this government would solve our cost of living crisis, our power crisis, our foreign exchange crisis, our law and order crisis and our employment crisis.
Governor Bird said people expect higher standards of responsibility from leaders in the stewardship of public funds especially from MPs.
“And the people are right to expect higher standards on matters such as this because we are custodians of the public interest.
“Holding public office is a sacred trust and our ability and attitude to be prudent and honest in the use of public funds is critical. We are not just project managers.
“I had no prior knowledge of the Paraka payments or the Connect PNG payments until the details were made public. If I remain in government, it will mean that I support these types of behavior. This would go against everything I stand for.
“I remained in government because I was committed to the work on Elections, GEWE and Provincial government.
“I have had many disagreements with the Government on issues of ethics, philosophy and management but this latest revelation is difficult to reconcile,” Governor Bird said.
He stressed that the prosperity of the country cannot be measured by the success in one or two districts while entire provinces are going backward.
“Provinces are collections of districts that must complement each other.
Bird stated that public funds are being weaponised to favour certain districts to the detriment of our country. PNG needs a new formula for growth and equitable sharing of the nation’s wealth.”
Meantime, Bulolo MP Sam Basil Jnr said his decision to move deeply reflects on the leadership of his late father and former Deputy Prime Minister late Sam Basil.
“Since joining the Marape-Rosso government in 2022, my intention has always been to ensure a healthy contribution to our national agenda in the hopes of securing an equitable and fair level of development assistance for Morobe and the people of Bulolo.
“Over the many months before my decision, it had become clear to me that my calls to action for several important issues facing Morobe province as a whole were taken very lightly.
“Issues like the Basil legacy flyover project over the Kumalu River, the Wau-Bulolo Highway, Wafi-Golpu/Hidden Valley outstanding development issues, medicine shortages for our communities, and many more, have all attracted no interest from our national leaders.
“It is in the spirit of my father’s political philosophy of doing what he thought was best for his people, knowing that it would impact the country, I am resigning to once again establish ULP as Morobe Province’s pride and restore our position as a province that must stand firm in the best interest of this nation,” Basil Jr said.","Politics, Disgust",Politics,Disgust
