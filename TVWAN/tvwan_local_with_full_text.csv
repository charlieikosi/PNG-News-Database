Police Lead Strong Drive for Peaceful LLG Elections,27/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6610,"Security forces in Kairuku District are taking center stage as the 2025 Local Level Government (LLG) Elections get underway. It launched one of the most comprehensive election security operations in recent years to ensure a safe and transparent democratic process.
LLG Elections in the district kicked off today with Mekeo and Kairuku LLG. Kuni will hold its polling tomorrow, October 27, 2025.
District Election Operations Commander and Bereina Police Station Commander, Sergeant Willie Hoiba, confirmed that 84 police personnel have been deployed across the three LLGs - Mekeo, Kairuku, and Kuni - to maintain peace and order throughout the polling period.
“Our priority is to create a safe and secure environment for both election officials and voters. We want to see polling conducted without fear, intimidation, or interference,” Sgt Hoiba said.
Unlike previous elections where isolated incidents disrupted voting, this year’s operation focuses on strategic placement of officers and closer collaboration between the police, Electoral Commission, and community leaders.
The deployment plan assigns 46 officers to Mekeo, 22 to Kairuku, and 16 to Kuni, with teams already stationed at critical points to deter any potential disturbances.
“We are working closely with the Electoral Commission, local leaders, and community elders to make sure everything runs smoothly. Our officers will be stationed at all critical points to respond quickly to any disturbance,” Sgt Hoiba added.
While security teams work to protect the integrity of the polls, election officials are facing their own challenges in reaching remote communities. The Kairuku LLG Assistant Returning Officer confirmed that eight polling teams have been dispatched to cover 22 wards, including hard-to-reach coastal and inland areas.
“We have prepared well, and our teams are committed to completing their duties responsibly. The people of Kairuku are eager to make their voices heard,” she said.
Community leaders across the district have also called for unity, urging residents to respect polling officials and allow the process to run peacefully."
RPNGC to host PinkTober fundraiser,27/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6609,"The Constabulary's Human Resource Division is again spearheading the October 2025 fundraising activity, aimed at supporting the fight against breast cancer in the country.
The staff from Police headquarters will stage a BBQ at the Boroko Police Station on Wednesday, October 2025, from 10 am onwards to raise funds for the PNG Cancer Foundation and the Cancer Ward of Port Moresby General Hospital.
Deputy Commissioner and Chief of Police Administration, Dr. Philip Mitna, said the theme for this year's awareness campaign is ""Together we fight, to save lives through cancer awareness.""
Dr Mitna said the purpose of this fundraising activity is to raise money to support the work of the Cancer Foundation and the PNG Cancer Ward at the Port Moresby General Hospital.
DCP Mitna said, apart from breast cancer, the RPNGC recognises the existence of all forms of cancer in the communities and their adverse impact on society.
He said cancer has claimed the lives of many of our citizens over the years, and the RPNGC is no exception, while emphatically stressing the importance of this fundraising drive.
""To commemorate the start of the PinkTober campaign, the policewomen of NCD/Central Command will walk from the 4 Mile Traffic office to the Baroko Police Station in a show of solidarity and strength.
“They are not alone in this campaign because several countries around the world are also staging similar events in their quest to prevent or minimize breast cancer across the world,” DCP Mitna said.
He said last year the Constabulary raised over K90,000, mostly from donations coming from generous individuals and corporate entities in NCD and Central Province.
The Deputy Commissioner again appealed to the residents of NCD, both within the private and public sectors, as well as corporate entities, to support this worthy cause. He said anyone in society can one day fall victim to cancer.
Dr Mitna said the PinkTober initiative is all about uniting people in the fight against cancer. They must help each other to protect and fight against cancer in the community."
Smooth LLG polling in Lae,27/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6608,"Polling for the 2025 Local Level Government elections began today in the 16 wards of Lae district, in Morobe Province.
For Ward 2 at Top Town, in the Lae Urban LLG covering the Ward Service Office Area, polling officials, led by presiding officer Timothy Holingu, commenced at 9am, with Holingu expecting a turnout of 500 voters for the area.
Polling started peacefully for Ward Two residents from the streets of Gannet, Falcon, Eagle, Crane, Plover, Swift, Tern, Quail, Hornbill, and especially those near the Huonville Primary School.
Moving to Ahi LLG, Ward Two of West Butibam polled at the Butibam Resource Centre, under the watchful eyes of polling team number 147.
Presiding officer, Basoka Mangheyuc, said matters had to be sorted hence polling started after 8am.
“We expected 1,170 voters; 618 males and 552 females,” said Mangheyuc.
“We had a little bit of a challenge; this is concerning our assistant presiding officer. The scrutineers and candidates asked me to swap and replace her, so we did that. So, our assistant presiding officer was sent to Butibam East, and we had to pull the assistant presiding officer from there to here. We had to swap for the sake of transparency.”
Lae Urban’s Ward Five, at the PNG University of Technology, had two polling venues; the polling venue near the coffee shop was under polling team 227, while the one opposite the uni force office was manned by polling team 228.
Presiding officer of polling team 228, Solomon Bulu, outlined that the only glitch today was the late delivery of polling materials from the Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium, hence their two-hour late start at 10am.
“Due to the election being deferred a couple of times, it’s quite tough with us the polling officials,” said Bulu. “Polling officials were selected last minute so we were not prepared for that. So, we had to attend our training for a day at the eleventh hour and we came to the polling site. That was due to things beyond our control.”
Polling team 228 – consisting of seven officials and three law enforcers – is anticipating 1,000 voters for the one-day polling, which is set to close at 6pm."

NMCA to probe government spending,27/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6603,"Prime Minister James Marape has announced the establishment of the National Monitoring and Coordination Authority as part of ongoing efforts to enhance value for money in government spending.
This initiative was unveiled during the launch of the Reset PNG@50 blueprint at the University of Papua New Guinea.
The new authority will be tasked with overseeing project implementation and monitoring expenditure, ensuring that public funds are utilized effectively and transparently.
In his address, Marape emphasized the importance of financial discipline and accountability, calling on provincial administrators, district development authorities, and departmental heads to adhere to these principles.
“This new authority will check where the money goes, what it delivers, and whether it benefits the people,” the prime minister said.
“Money must move from paper to the ground (an) if it doesn’t reach the people, then it has failed its purpo
se.”
Marape reminded leaders and officials that their positions are a privilege, not an entitlement.
“If a minister or superior asks you to do something against the law, stand for what is right,” he said.
“The country’s laws come first — not politics, not personalities,” he said."
LLG processes need reviewing: Sinai,27/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6600,"Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai has raised concerns that the Local Level Government processes need reviewing so that the legal requirements for creating new wards and LLGs are strictly managed and guided by law and implemented within a fixed timeline.
Sinai said one of the delays and deferral of the LLG elections was being the new proclamations – creation of new wards and LLGs in the country on the eve of the election, a process managed by the Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs.
“This has placed extra workload on the provincial electoral staff to identify and create new rolls for the new wards and LLGs through the voter alignment process using the existing rolls.”
“As such it is imperative that the administrative and technical issues identified herein be fully addressed in order to guarantee the special rights of eligible citizens under Section 50 of the Constitution, namely the right to vote and stand for public office.
“These are legal issues that needs to be handled with care. Such as identifying a voter for the new ward and creating a new roll.
“Once you have separated the voters according to the new wards from the existing rolls, you then take into account new voters who are not on the roll but turned 18 and are eligible to vote.
“The 2022 Electoral Roll can be used as the base to update the rolls, but if any person who is not happy must object to the enrollment which is provided for under Section 48 of the Organic Law on National and Local Government Election,” he said.
He said the PNG Electoral Commission is committed to upholding the highest standards of electoral integrity and ensuring that elections are free, fair and credible.
“It also recognizes the importance of LLG elections to strengthen grassroots democracy and inclusive representation.
Mr Sinai said the Electoral Commission by law is required to prepare the Electoral Rolls six (6) months before the anniversary of the next election, may it be National General Election or Local Level Government election.
“Due to staff shortage, PNGEC gets support from LLG public servants and the provincial administrations to assist with the roll updates in the provinces.
“This is why the Electoral Commission is embarking on all of society approach to fixing the roll issue using a photo to the name.
“We are asking the National Government, provincial administrations, Local Level Governments, Wards and citizens to help identify the voters and prepare a biometric electoral roll for the good of the elections,” he said."
Polling commences for LLG elections,27/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6599,"Polling for Local Level Government elections commenced today, Monday October 27, 2025.
“The PNGEC acknowledges the public’s strong interest in timely elections, and remains fully committed to progressing these elections and polling shall commence this week starting Monday 27 October 2027,” said PNG Electoral Commission Simon Sinai said in a media release issued today.
Sinai said the delays were caused by number of factors, including the new proclamations – the creation of new wards and LLGs in the country on the eve of the election – a process managed by the Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs.
“This has placed extra workload on the provincial electoral staff to identify and create new rolls for the new wards and LLGs through the voter alignment process using the existing rolls,” Sinai explained.
Polling will end on November 8, 2025 and counting begins November 09.
LLG election writs will be returned on Friday November 21, 2025."
K56b spent on districts,27/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6598,"Prime Minister James Marape recently highlighted that over K56 billion in public funds has been allocated across Papua New Guinea in the past six years.
During the launch of the Reset PNG@50 blueprint at the University of Papua New Guinea, he urged government agencies, provincial administrations, districts, and public institutions to deliver tangible outcomes from these investments.
Marape explained that this significant amount represents total funding distributed by his administration since 2019, covering a range of sectors including provincial and district governance, health authorities, and educational institutions such as universities and colleges.
“That is not a small sum. Every leader, administrator, and public servant must ask: what have we done with it?”
He said the amount represented the government’s commitment to decentralising service delivery and ensuring every level of government had access to resources.
“But I ask again — what has been achieved? Where are the results? The money is being released, but are we seeing improvement in schools, hospitals, and roads?” he said.
He revealed that recent administrative reviews had uncovered serious gaps in financial reporting and compliance, including agencies and authorities that failed to submit expenditure reports for several years.
He shared a recent example involving a senior official whose contract renewal he was forced to reject after discovering a five-year failure to provide expenditure reports.
“I had to cast a deciding vote against his reappointment,” he said.
The Prime Minister reiterated that the government will no longer tolerate poor financial management."

“It’s inspiring to see how the PNG AAP connects members nationwide and globally through training and professional development. I’m proud to be part of this network,” Ms. Dama shared.
Beyond training, the association also runs a financial platform that helps members invest and access small loans. Mrs. Supa explained that the finance arm of PNG AAP offers two key options:
Long-term investment plans with high-interest returns.
Short-term savings schemes through TISA, available on a one-month, three-month, or six-month basis.
The PNG AAP continues to play a vital role in shaping capable, confident, and forward-looking administrative professionals across Papua New Guinea, ensuring that members are not only skilled in office management but are also financially empowered and ready for the digital future."
PHA Sets Leadership Benchmark,26/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6593,"A smooth handover of leadership took place today at the West New Britain Provincial Health Authority (WNB PHA) as outgoing Chief Executive Officer Stanis Tao formally passed the baton to incoming Acting CEO Dr Joseph Nale.
The ceremony, facilitated by Board Chair Steven Raphael and witnessed by board members and staff, marks a purposeful step in ensuring continuity in health leadership for the province.
Mr Raphael thanked Mr Tao for his dedicated leadership and the many services rendered to the people of West New Britain. He then welcomed Dr Nale, expressing full confidence in his capacity to steer the authority over the next three months, as a recruitment process is underway for a permanent CEO.
Legal Counsel for the National Department of Health (NDOH), Margareth Sinimbi, praised the WNB PHA for its “smooth transition”, noting that many comparable health authorities across the country struggle with change-overs.
In his remarks, Mr Tao thanked the WNB PHA team for their dedication and tireless service, and urged them to embrace Dr Nale’s leadership and work cooperatively during the treatment of the interim period.
With this handover complete, the authority now looks ahead to a three-month interim before a permanent appointment is made, assuring health staff and the public of no interruption to services."
PNG commits to global peace and development,26/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6591,"The Papua New Guinea Government has committed to global peace and development on United Nations Day in Port Moresby.
Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, Soroi Eoe, speaking on behalf of Prime Minister James Marape, said PNG’s modern nationhood was deeply linked to the United Nations, from its early years under the UN Trusteeship system to its admission as the UN’s 143rd member on 16 September 1975.
“When our flag was raised, the United Nations did not merely recognise Papua New Guinea — it welcomed us home,” he said. “That moment affirmed our place within a family committed to peace, justice, and human dignity.”
He noted that Papua New Guinea’s cultural and linguistic diversity mirrored the UN’s global mission of unity through diversity. “Like the UN, we are a nation of hundreds of languages and cultures, yet united under one flag,” he said.
Minister Eoe outlined how, over the past five decades, Papua New Guinea had exercised principled leadership at the UN, especially on issues that directly affect its people.
“We speak for communities on the frontline of climate change,” he said. “We advocate for sustainable oceans, forest stewardship, and financing models that reward countries protecting the lungs and blue carbon sinks of the planet.”
He said these positions were rooted in the daily realities of Papua New Guineans — from the Highlands to the Sepik, and from the Bismarck to the Coral Sea.
Minister Eoe highlighted the strength of the partnership between Papua New Guinea and the UN across key areas such as climate-resilient infrastructure, clean energy, and job-creating agriculture.
“When droughts, landslides, and health emergencies struck, the UN stood with us — from vaccination campaigns to emergency relief and reconstruction. This is multilateralism in action: a hand extended when it matters most,” he said.
He also paid tribute to the UN’s role in peacebuilding efforts in Bougainville, acknowledging its contribution from ceasefire monitoring to post-referendum dialogue.
Minister Eoe said the recent visit of UN Secretary-General António Guterres — the first by a sitting UN chief — was a defining moment in PNG-UN relations.
“His visit reflected the UN’s confidence in our leadership in the Pacific,” he said. “He met Prime Minister Marape, addressed our National Parliament, and visited Wewak, Nuku, and Mt Hagen, witnessing the resilience and hope of our people.”
He noted that Prime Minister Marape’s address to the 80th Session of the UN General Assembly in New York underscored PNG’s leadership in global advocacy.
“Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed our commitment to the UN Charter and called for reforms to the global financial system to value forests, oceans, and climate resilience as global public goods,” Minister Eoe said. “Papua New Guinea will not be a bystander — we will be a solutions country.”
Minister Eoe said PNG supported reforms to make the UN “more representative and responsive” to today’s global challenges, including geopolitical tensions, food insecurity, and climate impacts.
He thanked the UN Country Team for its work with PNG’s government, churches, youth, and women’s groups, saying the partnership’s impact was “measured not in reports but in results — in the vaccinated child, the safe school, the functioning health post, and the peaceful community.”"
LDC Taps Local Expertise for Asset Valuation,26/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6590,"The Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) is charting a bold investment path for Papua New Guinea’s livestock industry through a nationwide asset valuation project that is set to redefine how its public assets are leveraged for economic growth.
This pathway falls in line with LDC’s efforts to provide feedback to the government after a directive that came from the Prime Minister dated 17th March 2020, for a campaign involving reclamation and refurbishment to take stock of all government-owned assets under LDC.
On Thursday, October 23, 2025, during a signing ceremony, Chairman of the LDC Board, Martin Ginyaru, said the Government has spent substantial amounts on the reclamation program, and the onus is on the valuers to provide a report back for transparency and good governance.
LDC has engaged five reputable local asset valuation companies from a total of 11 applicants who responded to a public advertisement.
The internal procurement committee, chaired by LDC Finance Manager, Otto Wangillen, selected
Those companies are based on merit, given their wide experience and local knowledge of the real estate market across PNG.
The Valuers are tasked with conducting a comprehensive value assessment of LDC’s cattle ranches, abattoirs, and state–owned land under LDC across the country.
The decision to engage independent local valuers was made by the LDC Board of Directors to ensure this valuation process would not only restore operational clarity but also form the backbone of LDC’s investment forecast and development strategy.
“Valuation is not just a technical requirement; it is our launchpad for investment,” said Ginyaru.
He further added that engaging local valuators ensures that the process is not only technically sound but also grounded in local knowledge and accountability. This is a critical step in transforming underutilized assets into viable investment platforms,” he further added.
The valuers, drawn from across PNG, are tasked with conducting valuations on LDC’s extensive portfolio of properties and assets. Their work is central to the government’s asset valuation campaign, which aims to boost investor confidence, improve transparency, and lay the groundwork for public-private partnerships.
The asset valuation exercise will provide the transparency and credibility needed to structure investment-ready proposals. With clear asset records, LDC can now offer investors a portfolio of viable opportunities backed by verified data and government support.
Furthermore, the valuation initiative is part of PNG’s Medium-Term Development Plan IV 2023–2027, which targets self-sufficiency in meat production by 2030.
By quantifying the value and potential of its livestock infrastructure, LDC is positioning itself as a catalyst for agribusiness growth and rural development.
The valuation project is set to cost at least K500,000 in total and is expected to be concluded before the end of 2025."
Kwikila National Court launch solar project,26/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6589,"Kwikila District and National Court have launched a first Solar pilot project aimed to provide a sufficient and reliable power supply to the court facility.
Due to the ongoing power outages, the court's operations closed, staff were sent home, and all court matters were stood down. Therefore, the Magisterial Services, in support of the National Judicial Staff Services, has engaged the Department of ICT and Blueeti, the contractor, to facilitate its solar power project, a solution aimed at increasing power connectivity to the court facility.
The project was launched on Friday, October 24th, at the court precinct.
The project aligns with the Magisterial Service ICT strategic plan 2026- 2030. Kwilila was chosen as a pilot site for the ICT update because of its accessibility and the issue of frequent power disruption. The Bluetti system is capable of generating 100 volts and is powered by portable solar technology.
Its main components include a generator, four highly efficient portable solar panels, and a power management system, which enables it to do switchovers.
District Court registrar Anna Aigilo said the district courts have 66 court locations in PNG, and because most of the courts are situated outside of a district, access to services is limited. Therefore, the launching of this pilot project will pave the way for the other district courts to access this service.
“Because we are out in the districts, we face geographical challenges to have access to basic services, and power or electricity is one of those challenges we face. For a court to operate, we must have a constant supply of electricity,” Aigilo said.
National Judicial Staff Services Secretary Nicodemus Mosoro commended the magisterial services for initiating this initiative, as it sets a precedent for other courts to have solar implementation in their court facilities.
Mosoro said, apart from the solar project, they aimed to integrate a new ICT system that would enable court users to use their phones and access court services.
“Our people can be able to file their matters on your smartphones wherever they are. Find out about their next court hearing date and others. This is our commitment to bring service to our people,” he said.
Mosoro said other plans in place are to establish a cell block, to remand perpetrators awaiting court, due to the inability of a cell block in Kwikila.
Meanwhile, Rigo Acting District Administrator Murry Konido pledged his support to the project, commanding the magisterial services to embrace clean energy to tackle ongoing power outages in the district."
Governor Parkop Commends Catholic Church’s Nation-Building Role,26/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6587,"During the Thanksgiving Mass celebrating the canonization of Saint Peter ToRot and 50 years of the Catholic Church’s growth in Papua New Guinea, NCD Governor Powes Parkop delivered a heartfelt address acknowledging the Church’s enduring impact on the nation.
Governor Parkop thanked the Catholic Church leadership for organizing the national celebration and for its continued role in shaping the country’s moral, educational, and social foundations. He extended special appreciation to numerous businesses and partners for their contributions to the event and to national development.
He also commended the parish ministries, religious congregations, and Catholic faithful across the country for their commitment to community service and youth development.
“This is a great day for us to give thanks to God Almighty for our country and to celebrate the canonization of Saint Peter ToRot,” Governor Parkop said. “The Catholic Church has been a blessing to our people and our nation — shaping lives, nurturing children, and building a strong moral foundation for the future.”"
Church Marks 50 Years Blessed,26/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6586,"The Catholic Church in Papua New Guinea has marked a historic milestone, celebrating 50 years of national independence alongside the canonisation of Saint Peter ToRot, the country’s first saint and martyr, during a Thanksgiving Mass at Sir Hubert Murray Stadium.
Delivering his address, Cardinal Sir John Ribat, Archbishop of Port Moresby, reflected on the Church’s journey from its missionary roots in 1844 to its present status as a pillar of faith, education, and health services.
With a membership of 2.5 million Catholics — one-quarter of PNG’s population, the Church stands as the second-largest health provider and maintains a vast network of schools and tertiary institutions across the country.
Cardinal Ribat described the Church’s transformation from a “missionary church to a local church,” emphasising its integral role in PNG’s growth as a nation.
“After 50 years as a nation, the Catholic Church has also grown,” he said.
“We are truly blessed and have many reasons to thank God Almighty for His many blessings.”
The Archbishop also paid tribute to the early missionaries whose efforts laid the foundation for the Church’s expansion such as Vunapope in East New Britain, Yule Island in Central, and Alexishafen in Madang; He acknowledged the sacrifices of priests and catechists who carried the Gospel through war, hardship, and isolation.
He said the canonisation of Saint Peter ToRot on October 18, 2025, following Pope Francis’ visit in 2024, symbolises global recognition of faith lived out in the everyday life of Papua New Guineans.
“Peter ToRot lived, worked, and died a catechist,” Cardinal Ribat said.
“The universal Church has recognized his courageous witness to faith. We are proud and grateful.”
Cardinal Ribat expressed gratitude to national and provincial leaders, sponsors, and lay members for their contributions to the Church’s mission. He thanked supporters including NCD Governor Powes Parkop, Central Governor Rufina Peter, Lae Biscuits, SVS Group of Companies, and others who helped make the thanksgiving event possible.
The Mass ended with the opening of the Church Expo, inviting the public to explore the many ministries and services provided by the Catholic Church across PNG, including health, education, and social development programs.
“The Church keeps the light of Christ burning in every corner of our nation,” Cardinal Ribat said.
“We continue to walk as pilgrims of hope, journeying from darkness to light.”"
Faith-based organization highlights lack of rehabilitation programs at prisons,25/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6582,"Correctional Services are mandated to correct, rehabilitate, and reintegrate inmates for a smooth transition back into communities after serving prison terms. But insiders say most prisons lack functioning programs with no trained counselors, vocational training, transitional housing, legal aid, or follow-up support. For many inmates, release simply means returning to society with no skills, no support, and no second chance.
This was revealed by a faith-based organisation during the ABCID PNG- MDI conference held on 24th October at Lamana Hotel Port Moresby. Themed ""Safe Spaces, Strong Voices,” the conference was aimed at fostering networking, collaboration and media awareness and civil society organisations working to address violence, integration, and community healing.
Hope Behind Bars (HBB) Program, a faith-based initiative run by Pastor Simon Kuman and his family tries to fill this gap through their program. Broadcasted every Thursday and Saturday from 9–11 a.m. on Wantok Radio Light, the program shares testimonies from former inmates who’ve rebuilt their lives. It’s not government-funded — it’s powered by faith, family, and a microphone.
“We’ve rehabilitated nearly 500 inmates,"" Ps Kuman says. “Four of them now co-host the show, warning youth about violence and crime.”
The team records stories inside correctional facilities, counsels released inmates, and visits schools to raise awareness. “We’ve seen men walk out after 23 years with hope, not hatred,” Ps Kuman says. “Lives are being rebuilt — not by policy, but by community love.”
He calls  for more partners: legal experts, counselors, churches, and media allies to help amplify the message. “Everyone deserves a second chance,” he says. “Hope is not a policy. It’s a promise.”"
Turning Buai Waste Green,25/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6580,"A Port Moresby agriculturalist has transformed one of Papua New Guinea’s biggest waste problems into an award-winning solution, turning discarded betelnut husks into an eco-friendly gardening product.
Geno Geno, founder of The Seed Supplier, has been crowned the overall winner of the 2025 Lily Homemade Microbusiness Competition for her innovative Areca Fibre Mulch — a sustainable mulch made from buai husks that reduces street litter while helping plants and trees retain moisture.
“Our process ensures that all bacteria and unwanted pathogens are removed,” Geno said. “We’re working with city managers to scale collection across every suburb — the goal is to cover the base of every garden bed and tree in Port Moresby.”
The initiative, born from a desire to clean up the city and promote greener practices, impressed judges for its environmental and social impact. Geno received K12,000 in prize money, sponsored by MiBank, the Australian Government through the PNGAus Partnership, and Women’s Micro Bank.
This is not Geno’s first win — she also claimed top honours in the inaugural 2022 Lily Homemade competition with her compostable betelnut palm leaf plates, bowls, and spoons. Since her latest win, she has introduced buai-skin bins to prevent spit contamination and showcased her product internationally at a climate adaptation summer school in Germany.
Second place went to Carole Cholai, an IT specialist and breast cancer survivor, for her one-sided post-mastectomy bra under her SistaLuv Foundation, a social enterprise that supports women through recovery and awareness programs in partnership with the Port Moresby General Hospital Cancer Unit.
Third place was awarded to Lae agronomist Nicholar Boas for her Warapipe Herbal Blue Salt, infused with butterfly pea flowers to help combat lifestyle diseases. Boas has since launched her Blue Bloome brand and is seeking investment to expand production.
This year’s competition attracted 150 entries nationwide, with 15 finalists attending a four-day business workshop at the Women’s Business Resource Centre, supported by the Australian Government through the PNGAus Partnership. Participants received mentoring from MiBank, Mama Bank, CPL Group, and media partners.
The program continues to empower Papua New Guinea’s emerging entrepreneurs, transforming creative homemade ideas into sustainable enterprises — from organic hair dye makers to dairy-free dessert producers.
A full wrap-up of the competition, including a shopping guide of the top 50 products, is featured in Lily Magazine Issue #28, released this week."

Promoting Peace Through storytelling,24/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6578,"A new, Australian-funded initiative is harnessing the power of storytelling to promote peace, empathy, and non-violence among Papua New Guineans of all ages.
The Asia Foundation (TAF) has launched the ""Let’s Read for Peace and Justice Project,"" which will produce nearly 7,000 locally inspired storybooks to encourage peaceful conflict resolution and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence.
The initiative, funded through a grant under the Australia–Papua New Guinea Law and Justice Partnership, is a direct effort to build safer, more respectful communities by sparking crucial conversations between children and adults.
Beyond publishing, TAF will organize interactive reading sessions in schools, community centres, and churches. These sessions will serve as platforms where children and adults can engage in discussions about peaceful ways to resolve conflicts.
The project also includes training workshops for local authors, illustrators, and educators. This will help build skills for ongoing, community-driven storytelling, empowering individuals to seek support and solutions through both formal and informal justice pathways.
This initiative is a part of Australia’s ongoing partnership with Papua New Guinea to promote peace, justice, and rule of law."
Renewed national commitment to children required,24/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6577,"The special Parliamentary Committee on Children and Youth Well-being has launched a Bold National Review to Secure the Future of PNG’s Children, during the Committee’s inaugural session at the Parliament State Function Room on the 14th and 15th of October 2025.
The special Parliamentary Committee on Children and Youth Well-being marked a historic moment, setting the foundation for stronger parliamentary oversight, accountability, and action to improve the lives of children and youth across the country.
“Now is the time for all of us to think about our children,” declared Governor Powes Parkop, Chair of the Special Parliamentary Committee on Children and Youth Well-being, as he opened the Committee’s first-ever inquiry session in Parliament held on 14-15 October, 2025.
Over two days, the inquiry brought together Members of Parliament, Provincial Governors, key government departments, and development partners including UNICEF. It examined challenges and progress in health, education, nutrition, child protection, WASH, and provincial governance, signaling a new era of results-focused collaboration.
Children’s Health and Nutrition: “From the Womb to the Tomb”
Health was at the center of the Committee’s deliberations. Acting Health Secretary, Ken Wai emphasized the Department’s life-cycle responsibility, “looking after a human being from the womb to the tomb.”
Despite gains in life expectancy, the Committee noted that national immunization coverage remains critically low at 47%, with provinces such as Madang at only 22%. The Committee pressed for stronger coordination between the National Department of Health (NDoH) and Provincial Health Authorities (PHAs) to close gaps and improve accountability.
Governor Parkop called for urgency saying, “We cannot continue to normalize poor child health outcomes or accept malnutrition as routine. Poor nutrition is robbing our children of their potential and our nation of its future.”
In response the NDoH committed to finalizing amendments to the PHA Act to strengthen provincial oversight and to fast-track approval of the Village Health Assistant (VHA) Policy by 2026. The Department also pledged to roll out a National Nutrition Survey in 2026 and to use the National Nutrition Summit for greater cross-sectoral coordination.
Education and Early Childhood Development: Building Foundations for the Future.
The Committee reviewed evidence showing that while over 80% of children enter primary school, only 5–10% reach university or college.
Governor Parkop urged a fundamental rethink: “Education is the great equalizer but only if every child is able to stay in school, learn, and thrive.”
Meanwhile, the Department of Education presented progress on the Early Childhood Education (ECE) Policy, which plans for two years of pre-primary learning (K1–K2) alongside the education 1-6-6 reform. However, challenges remain include ECE teachers not yet on payroll and limited provincial funding for early learning centers.
The Committee recommended that ECE teacher salaries be integrated into the 2026 national budget, and that the Department finalize the national ECE expansion plan, including teacher registration, curriculum rollout, and improved WASH facilities in schools.
Child Protection: Strengthening Accountability and Action
The Committee raised deep concern over the slow implementation of the Lukautim Pikinini Act (2015) and the limited operational capacity of the National Office of Child and Family Services (NOCFS). Only 60 of 130 approved positions are currently filled, and the National Child and Family Services Council has been inactive since 2023. Governor Parkop stressed that child protection cannot remain as an afterthought:
“Every day a child faces abuse, neglect, or violence, we fail in our duty. Protection must be at the heart of government responsibility.” Parkop said.
NOCFS committed to expanding the number of child protection officers to 180 by 2025, reactivating the National Child and Family Services Council by early 2026, and rolling out Provincial Child and Family Services Councils across all provinces.
The Committee directed DfCDR and NOCFS to submit a reform and staffing plan by end-2025 and to clarify institutional oversight to ensure greater accountability."
Following the money trail,24/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6576,"Following yesterday’s sentencing of the former Deputy Secretary of Finance, Jacob Yafai to 22 years in prison, police minister Peter Tsiamalili Jnr said it is time to follow the money trail. Minister Tsiamalili said Yafai’s conviction is the beginning of a full-scale financial recovery operation. The Asset Restraint and Recovery Working (ARROW) Group has been directed to pursue all assets linked to the K41.8 million kina.
Tsiamalili said the court’s conviction has now provided the legal foundation and momentum for police to begin tracing the stolen K41.8 million, marking the start of a broader money-trail investigation that will extend as far back as necessary — even over the past decade.
“Now that the courts have established guilt, the RPNGC has a clear legal mandate to follow the money trail — wherever it leads and however far back it goes. No one who participated in these crimes will escape accountability,” he said. “The conviction gives us the authority to act decisively.”
The minister confirmed that Police Commissioner David Manning has directed the ARROW Group to immediately pursue all assets linked to the stolen funds, including those transferred, hidden, or laundered through associates.
“ARROW is now tracing all transactions, properties, and offshore holdings connected to these funds,” Tsiamalili said. “There is no way K41.8 million of public money will simply disappear.”
“When criminals steal from the State, they steal from the sick in our hospitals, from the children in our schools, and from our police who serve the people.
“The conviction of Yafai gives confidence that the system works — and it empowers us to recover what was stolen, not just from this case but from years of unchecked corruption,” he said.
The ARROW Group includes financial and legal experts from the Bank of Papua New Guinea’s Financial Analysis and Supervision Unit (FASU), the RPNGC National Fraud and Anti-Corruption Directorate (NFACD), and the Office of the Public Prosecutor (OPP).
“This is just the start,” the minister said. “The conviction has opened the door - now the police will walk through it and bring back what belongs to our people.”"
LLG polling begins,24/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6571,"Polling for the long delayed Local Level Government elections is now set to start tomorrow, Saturday October 25, 2025 but because this date falls on a weekend, polls will officially commence on Monday, October 27.
Electoral Commissioner Simon Sinai said provinces have a choice to decide when to commence polling, as long as it fits within the polling schedule.
Sinai confirmed that all polling kits and ballot papers have been dispatched to all provinces.
He is satisfied with the preparations so far, confirming that provincial electoral staff have further sorted and distributed the materials according to the number of polling teams in their provinces. Second and third-tier trainings for polling and counting officials have also been conducted and polling teams are now ready to hit the ground running.

Students Innovate Cleaner Mining Solution,23/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6558,"Students from St. Charles Lwanga Secondary School in Port Moresby demonstrated their scientific creativity at the 2025 Climate Science Fair hosted by the Port Moresby Nature Park. They presented an innovative model to reduce environmental harm caused by mining tailings.
Grade 11 student, Pentason Tagupa, speaking on behalf of his team, explained that their project — titled “Filtration and Air Separation in Mining Processes” — focuses on developing a system to minimize chemical and gas emissions from tailings storage facilities (TSFs).
Tagupa described how the filtration process begins after ore extraction, where the slurry of ground rock, water, and chemicals — known as tailings — is filtered. “The residue, sand, and other impure substances remain while the water containing chemicals is pumped out by a DC motor into the dam,” he said.
Once filtered, gases released from the process are passed through an air separation chamber cooled to cryogenic temperatures below -100°C, condensing the air and separating gases based on their boiling points. These gases are then stored in cylinders for safe transport to laboratories, cosmetic industries, and food processing facilities.
The filtered water is further purified through distillation, which uses heat to evaporate and condense clean water into storage tanks, leaving chemical residues behind. Tagupa explained that this step ensures that the recycled water can be safely reused for other industrial or environmental purposes.
The project also explored how poor management of tailings facilities can cause serious ecological damage. Tailings that leak or burst under pressure can destroy forests, contaminate rivers, and harm marine life. The students emphasised that gases such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide  released from tailings contribute directly to global warming.
Their model highlights the role of natural carbon sinks — forests, oceans, and soils — in absorbing excess carbon and mitigating climate change. The team’s goal is to promote responsible mining practices and raise awareness about how scientific innovation can reduce the industry’s environmental footprint.
The Climate Science Fair, organized by the Port Moresby Nature Park under its “Love Your Nature Park, Protect Our Biodiversity” initiative, showcased dozens of student projects focused on renewable energy, waste management, and sustainable technologies.
The fair aims to nurture young scientists who can lead future environmental solutions for Papua New Guinea."

MRDC confirms royalty transfer for its beneficiaries,22/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6551,"The Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC) confirms that the Central Bank of Papua New Guinea has released accrued royalty payments for PNG LNG Project area landowners into their Trusts, which it manages.
MRDC is mandated under the Oil & Gas Act to manage benefits for project area landowners in petroleum projects in the country.
Under the benefits sharing arrangements reached at the UBBSA in Kokopo, before commencement of the PNG LNG Project, the royalty benefits are paid to the Government (into a trust account held at BPNG), which then releases them to its main beneficiaries: the landowners (70%), and the Hela, Southern Highlands, Gulf, Western and Central provincial governments and impacted local Level Governments (30%).
In accordance with the Oil & Gas Act, and benefits-sharing agreement reached in 2009, royalty and equity benefits for landowners are to be split in the 40:30:30 formula, where 40 per cent is paid as a cash benefit to benefitting clans, 30 per cent is invested in the Future Generation Fund (Investment), and 30 per cent in Community Infrastructure Trust Fund (social development projects).
MRDC Managing Director and CEO Augustine Mano welcomed the release of the royalty benefits.
“The release of the royalty payments is great news for landowners. The early release of these benefits to a number of these groups have been delayed by clan disputes and court cases.
“For Hides PDL1 landowners, this is timely. MRDC will proceed to complete the clan bank account opening and director elections exercise so payment can be made before the end of the year.
“This exercise commenced in April 2024 but was suspended due to a restraining order from the court obtained by a party. This case has now been resolved, and the restraining order lifted, clearing the way for us to resume.”
For Hides PDL7 landowners, royalty benefits for 2014 – 2021, and equity benefits for 2014 – 2017 have been paid. Their royalty (2022 – current) and equity (2018 – current) benefits will now be paid with the release of their royalty entitlement.
This also includes the Pipeline and the Plant Site landowners.
Royalty and equity benefits for PDL 2 (Kutubu) and PDL 3 & 4 (Gobe) will be withheld pending the resolution of a number of disputes that are currently in place.
With the opening of the new MRDC Office in Tari, Hela Province, last week, Mr Mano said that all royalty and equity benefits processing for Hela landowners will now be handled in Tari, not in Port Moresby.
“I want to encourage all landowners and their clan leaders who are in Port Moresby to return home. We have an office in Tari. Cooperate and work with us on the ground in Tari for the benefit of everyone.”
The Account Opening and Directors Elections Process for the Angore (PDL8) landowners will commence as soon as the PDL1 exercise is completed, while a Ministerial.
Meantime, determination is pending for the landowners of Juha (PDL8)."
DLPP completes capacity audit program in WNB,22/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6549,"The Department of Lands and Physical Planning (DLPP) concluded the Capacity Audit Program in West New Britain Province. This will now prepare the province to handle its land administration.
The delegation led by DLPP Secretary Benjamin Samson comprised directors and managers representing key technical divisions within the department.
These divisions include the Customary Lands ILG, Customary Land Registrations, Customary Land Development, State Land, Office of the Chief Physical Planner, Office of the Surveyor General, Office of the Valuer General, including Human Resources and the Policy and Legal Services.
The team visited the West New Britain Provincial Lands Office, including Nakanai and Talasea Districts, as part of a comprehensive assessment.
The visit was to physically assess whether the WNB Provincial Lands Division has the institutional capacity, technical expertise, and infrastructure to perform both state land and customary land functions in the province.
The Capacity Audit will also determine if the Provincial Administration is ready to take on key functions of the Land Board and the Physical Planning Board.
During the visit, the DLPP team engaged directly with the Provincial Administrators, as well as District Administrators, Provincial Planners, Surveyors, and Lands Officers to gather data and identify areas in need of institutional support and technical capacity building.
A formal report, including a proposed structure for the Provincial Lands Division, was presented to the West New Britain Provincial Administration for review and potential integration into its Provincial Administration Structure.
“We need to establish whether provinces have the capacity to host their own Land Boards and Physical Planning Boards. This is essential to ensure land matters are managed locally, rather than relying on the National Lands Department.
""When provincial services are unavailable, people turn to national boards. These functions must be decentralized to address land and development issues within each province,” Secretary Benjamin Samson said.
The West New Britain Provincial Government welcomed the findings of the Capacity Audit and expressed its commitment to strengthening institutional capacity for land governance.
The Capacity Audit findings and recommendations will inform future planning, resource allocation, and staff development to ensure provinces can independently manage both state and customary land matters."
PNG forest activists protest over Malaysian logging companies,22/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6548,"Representatives of Papua New Guinea’s civil society, alongside partners RimbaWatch and Bruno Manser Fonds, have voiced serious concerns regarding the deforestation of PNG's forests by major Malaysian companies.
On Tuesday, the group organized a protest in Kuala Lumpur, targeting the actions of Malaysian logging firms operating in Papua New Guinea.
This demonstration coincided with the release of a new report titled “Malaysia's Timber Colony: Exposing Malaysia’s Grip Over Papua New Guinea’s Forests.”
The report sheds light on Forest Clearing Authorities (FCAs), a licensing system that facilitates large-scale forest conversion and has been identified as a significant driver of deforestation in the country.
The coalition is urging heightened awareness and action to protect PNG’s vital forest ecosystems from unsustainable exploitation. The report states FCAs are issued by the government on the grounds of agricultural development.
However, they are often linked to the clear-cutting and subsequent conversion of highly biodiverse forests, with the timber being exported to China and few economic benefits generated within the country itself.
The report finds that 97 per cent (65 of 67) FCA licences are held by companies either registered in Malaysia, or in which Malaysian citizens are either the majority shareholders and/or directors.
These Malaysian-linked companies hold licenses that threaten at least 1.68 million hectares of primary rainforest in Papua New Guinea.
Primarily, of the 79 Malaysians who are linked to these companies, the report finds that 44 individuals might be associated with the “big six” Sarawakian logging firms (named). It states that together, these individuals alone control 60 per cent of the FCA licenses.
Since the 1990s, there has been an influx of Malaysian companies in the timber industry in PNG.
Forming part of the world’s third-largest intact tropical forest, 15 per cent of the country’s forest area has been degraded in recent years, and in 2013, PNG overtook Malaysia as the largest exporter of tropical timber in the world.
While the involvement of Malaysian companies in the timber industry is well-known within PNG, this is the first time a report systematically documents the extent of Malaysia’s timber dynasties in the country.
The Report says that beyond the significant impacts FCA licenses have on biodiversity loss in PNG, such projects almost exclusively occur on Indigenous customary land, and FCAs have been found to involve serious human rights abuses, including land-grabbing, violations of the right to Free, Prior, Informed Consent (FPIC) and physical violence.
In one case, a member of an Indigenous community was locked in a shipping container for one week.
Pamela Avusi, Coordinator of the PNG Environmental alliance, said: “FCAs are an extremely unsustainable logging practice and are often associated with violations of indigenous peoples' rights. We call on the Malaysian timber tycoons behind 97 per cent of these licenses to relinquish them. Papua New Guinea is destroying its forests and is fully aware of this.”
“For this reason, the government has once again announced a moratorium on tropical timber exports at the end of this year. It is time to stop deforestation now. Please stop cutting down our forests,” said Avusi.
The group also demanded that the Government of PNG fix the FCA licensing system, which includes a moratorium on all logging within FCAs until a review. The PNGEA and partners call on Malaysia to build the capacity of Malaysia’s National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights to govern the activities of Malaysia’s businesses abroad.
This could include establishing a Human Rights Tribunal and a Supply Chain Act, which would include provisions to compel Malaysian companies to adhere to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in their overseas activities.
“Papua New Guinea’s rainforests, part of the world’s third-largest tropical rainforest ecosystem, are increasingly at risk. The main threat is non-sustainable logging and forest clearing,” the report stated.
With an export volume of 2.5 million m3 in 2024, Papua New Guinea is the world’s largest exporter of tropical roundwood."

Audience members shared heartfelt reflections. “The films have powerfully highlighted the struggles faced by young people,” said La Salle’s Media Animators, Murray Misha and Miss Serah David.
Ms. Melissa Gorogo added, “Our hearts were so touched because we have all experienced so many of those situations ourselves.”
Media representatives like Malwai Sasingian from TVI and Maureen Orea from Tribe FM expressed continued support for promoting youth storytelling platforms.
As the curtains closed, the festival underscored a digital movement built on collaboration, faith, and purpose — inspiring hope for a brighter, more connected generation."
TSC says no negotiation for PNGTA,22/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6540,"The Teaching Service Commission (TSC) cannot go into negotiations with PNG Teachers Association because of several reasons, says TSC Chairman Samson Wangihomie.
He was responding to a letter signed by the PNTGA General Secretary on October 6, giving a seven-day notice to the TSC to respond to a PNGTA Teachers’ Salary Fixation Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for 2026 – 2028 from the date of notice.
The letter stated that after seven days the PNGTA would seek legal advice on the matter.
In response, Wangihomie said the Teachers Salary Fixation MoA cannot be renewed firstly because the position of the president and the National Management Committee (NMC) has expired therefore; TSC cannot go into negotiations with PNGTA.
“Even if we go for negotiations, it will still be unsuccessful because other parties involved, know that the term of the PNGTA executives has expired so they will not honor the negotiations,” he said.
The 2023 to 2025 MoA was to be reviewed in April as per the MoA. However, PNGTA came in very late to review it as they did in 2024 for the 2023 to 2025 MOA.
Wangihomie also questioned why PNGTA general secretary was the signatory of the letter that was sent to TSC.
“Why is PNGTA general secretary writing to the chairman of the teaching service, when he is not even the president of the union but is an employee of PNGTA? The General Secretary has no authority. The letter that they wrote has no effect because the acting General Secretary is an employee of the union,” he said.
Wangihomie said also that PNGTA does not have a log of claims that should justify and qualify what they have for the negotiation.
He said, most importantly the budget cycle for 2026 has passed. For the 2023 to 2025 MOA to be reviewed, it is therefore late, to be considered for 2026 Money Plan (Budget)."

The new ATR 72-600 will gradually replace the airline’s older Dash 8-100 fleet, simplifying operations and reducing costs.
More importantly, it ensures that air travel remains accessible to the thousands of Papua New Guineans who depend on PNG Air every week.
For nearly four decades, PNG Air has been a vital link between towns, cities, and remote communities."
PM meets with agencies of climate change,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6537,"Prime Minister James Marape recently held an important briefing with key Government agencies as Papua New Guinea prepares for the upcoming COP30 United Nations Climate Change Conference.
The Leaders session will be held from November 6–7, 2025, in Brazil — another major rainforest nation and partner in global climate advocacy.
The preparatory meeting, held at the Office of the Prime Minister, brought together Climate Change and Development Authority (CCDA) Acting Managing Director, Debra Sungi, the Conservation and Environment Protection Authority (CEPA) Managing Director, Jude Tukuliya, Provincial Member for Oro, Gary Juffa, and senior officials from CEPA, CCDA, and the Office of the Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Marape is scheduled to speak at the Leaders’ Session of COP30 on November 6. He will deliver PNG’s Country Statement — focusing on the protection of rainforest ecosystems, the value of biodiversity, carbon trading frameworks, and fair access to the Global Climate Fund for developing and climate-vulnerable nations.
“Papua New Guinea stands as one of the few remaining large rainforest nations in the world,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Our forests absorb carbon for the global good, yet our people receive very little compensation or recognition for the vital climate services we provide. At COP30, I will again remind the world that nations like ours deserve fair treatment and real climate financing — not just promises.”
PNG’s position remains firm — that developed and industrial nations responsible for the majority of global emissions must do more to honour their commitments to climate finance and technology transfer.
The Prime Minister noted that he intentionally did not attend COP29 in 2024 in Baku, Azerbaijan, in protest of the lack of meaningful progress from larger nations despite years of promises.
“I did not attend COP29 last year because too often, these global meetings have been long on talk and short on action,” PM Marape said.
“However, we are beginning to see encouraging signs that our collective call from the Pacific and other rainforest nations is being heard. COP30 in Brazil will be a defining moment — a chance to turn promises into practical outcomes.”"
Minister Reaffirms Rule of Law Over Customary Settlements,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6536,"Minister for Police, Peter Tsiamalili Jnr has commended the recent decision by Justice Graham Ellis, who sentenced a man to 20 years’ imprisonment for willful murder.
“The recent ruling by Justice Graham Ellis in Enga Province serves as a timely and important reminder: the rule of law must always stand above compensation and customary settlements,” Tsiamalili said.
The Minister affirmed the Government’s unwavering commitment to the principle that compensation is not an alternative to the application of criminal law.
“While traditional reconciliation practices remain a valued part of our cultural heritage, they cannot substitute the formal processes of justice under the laws of Papua New Guinea,” he said.
Tsiamalili Jnr emphasised that the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) must uphold the criminal standard prescribed by law, without fear or compromise.
“Police officers are not mediators — they are enforcers of the law. Their duty is to investigate, arrest, and charge offenders without fear or favour. It is then the responsibility of our courts to determine guilt and impose appropriate sentences based on the evidence presented,” he said.
The Minister reiterated that a clear separation of roles between police and judiciary is essential to maintaining peace, ensuring fairness, and protecting communities from the growing culture of impunity.
“Every officer of the RPNGC must remember that the strength of our nation depends on their commitment to justice, discipline, and the Constitution,” he said.
Tsiamalili Jnr concluded by reaffirming the Government’s support for the judiciary in upholding justice for all.
“No life lost should be treated lightly, and no law broken should go unanswered. We must ensure that our legal institutions remain strong, impartial, and respected — so that every citizen can have confidence in the rule of law,” he said."
Novel “Forgotten Land” Reveals Rabaul’s Past,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6535,"Lae-based author Marisa Jones has launched her latest historical novel, A Forgotten Land, a powerful story that shines light on one of Papua New Guinea’s most tragic yet overlooked chapters — the Japanese invasion of Rabaul during World War II.
The novel follows journalist Isabel Lee, who travels to Rabaul after the 1994 volcanic eruption to uncover its lost history. Her discovery of an old photograph unravels the story of Henry Meyer, the son of German-Australian plantation owners, and his love for Lin, a Chinese woman, amid the chaos of war.
The book captures the terror, love, and survival of those who lived through the Pacific War, when thousands were left behind as the Japanese advanced.
Jones said her inspiration came from real accounts of Australian nurses, soldiers, and Chinese civilians who suffered through the 1942 occupation. “When I started researching A Forgotten Land, I was amazed by the depth of history in Rabaul. It’s a place that has seen more devastation than anywhere else in PNG, and yet it’s rarely spoken about,” she said.
She highlighted the scale of the tragedy: 1,800 Australians were abandoned when Japan invaded, including 18 nurses taken as POWs at Vunapope Catholic Mission and 800 Chinese civilians interned at Ratongor Catholic Mission.
“Other than Berlin, Rabaul was bombed more than any other place in WW2. And yet, no one talks about this. No one talks about the town’s resilience in building itself back up after the 1937 eruption of Tavurvur, and again after WW2. No one talks about the eight hundred Australians that were killed on the Montevideo Maru when the US mistakenly attacked it. More Australians died in Rabaul than in Kokoda and yet it’s not honored the same way.
“This is important history. It should be remembered,” Jones added.
Known for her debut novel A Dangerous Land, which delicately explored PNG’s colonial past, Jones hopes her new release will spark a deeper appreciation for the resilience of Rabaul and its people, who rebuilt their lives after both the 1937 volcanic eruption and the destruction of World War II.
A Forgotten Land is available for purchase at Brian Bell, Gordon, and Duffy Café in Port Moresby. Jones will meet readers and sign copies on Saturday, October 25. More information can be found at www.marisajonesbooks.com"
Rocket stoves to improve rural standards,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6534,"A demonstration at the Siar village yesterday afternoon had villagers, especially mothers, in awe as the “Rocket Cooker” was introduced.
Created under the company Rocket Boil ‘N’ Cook by Paul McFarlane, an engineer by profession, this cooker was inspired from living at the Asuramba Manam Care Centre in Bogia in 2011.
Mr McFarlane is married to a Manam lady and saw first hand the reality struggles faced by the Manam Islanders in the Card Centres.
Firewood was a challenge often resulting in quarrels and fighting and as Papua New Guineans love their hot beverages such as tea and coffee, the need for constant heat and water got him thinking.
Using his professional knowledge, he capitalized in making a prototype of this genius invention which is not only efficient and convenient, it is portable, durable and does the work of two things at one time; cook food and boil water.
All these years after 2011, Paul and his wife put their time effort and money into making this innovation. This year, after the project was finalised, it was given to an international manufacturer. They left Auckland and traveled with their sample for demonstration in hopes of getting a local supplier on board to market it.
They managed to travel to Mt. Hagen, Lae and now in Madang to showcase their input into developing and making village life a bit easier.
The Rocket stove has an inbuilt 15L compartment for water which is the cylindrical part with a spout. The hollow in the Middle bit for the fire which lets cooking take place above, which has gap at the bottom for twigs to make fire.
One of the Siar mothers was so impressed with this stove that she cannot wait to have it on the shelves to get herself one. Francisca Palangat stayed that she could see this assist mothers including herself make cooking easier and on the other hand, it could also benefit them financially with little cooking market, as it is portable.
Whilst Mr. McFarlane and his wife are yet to establish a market in Papua New Guinea, they state that their product is already selling in New Zealand as people are finding it convenient to their needs.
Their main aim is to assist disadvantaged rural communities, however, they found that it is applicable to urban needs as well for camping/hunting trips, island cooking, disaster relief and in most instances in PNG, blackout situations."
"Houses burnt, several injured in Chimbu tribal clash",21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6533,"Five houses burnt, and several people have sustained injuries following a tribal fight between the Era and Kalubiagao tribes in Digine, Gumini district in Chimbu Province on Monday, October 20.
Simbu Provincial Police Commander Mazuc Rubiang confirmed that the fight between the two tribes started late yesterday after a serving member of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, who is on leave, was attacked by youths from the Era tribe during a drinking brawl.
He said guns were used in the fight, which resulted in shots being fired and several people injured, including the burning down of five houses. Police are investigating the matter.
""I thank the Taskforce police units who were onsite after the situation was reported. Those who were involved will be identified and dealt with. Some innocent people had been injured and also lost their properties. I have been raising awareness about how alcohol has caused lives and damage to homes and properties. The incident that happened last night is a result of drinking alcohol. We will investigate all of them,"" PPC Rubiang said.
At 4 a.m. today, PPC Rubiang was with his officers to make sure the situation was under control and no more fighting.
PPC Rubiang said they had spoken to both tribal groups to assist police in identifying those involved.
Meanwhile, Police presence continues in the area."
Gov’t will continue to pursue environmental policies: Marape,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6530,"The Government will continue to pursue policies that strengthen forest conservation, sustainable land use, renewable energy development, and climate resilience in rural communities.
Prime Minister James Marape made these remarks when meeting with relevant agencies on climate change to debrief before attending the COP30 meeting in Brazil in November.
“Our approach is to balance conservation with sustainable development,” he said.
“We want to protect our forests while empowering our people through sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, and responsible resource management. Climate finance and carbon credit systems must directly benefit our local communities who are the true custodians of our forests.”
The Prime Minister further emphasized that PNG’s participation at COP30 will go beyond the Conference itself, with plans already underway for post-COP30 implementation and alignment of national frameworks to attract more green investments and partnerships, as well as establishing relevant policy and legal frameworks to enable a stronger future for PNG in terms of rainforest or biodiversity.
“Our work does not end in Brazil,” PM Marape said.
“When our delegation returns, we will continue aligning our national policies to ensure that climate programs deliver real, measurable benefits for our people and our economy.”
Prime Minister Marape concluded by reaffirming that PNG will go to COP30 as a voice for rainforest nations and small island states, carrying a message of climate justice, shared responsibility, and global partnership."
Building Workforce Capability in Chimbu,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6529,"The Department of Personal Management (DPM) is taking major steps to strengthen public service delivery in the Highlands. DPM conducted a one-day workshop in Chimbu Province on Friday, October 17, to introduce the Capability Needs Analysis (CAN) program.
Led by Executive Manager for Strategic Policy Development, Idia Yuki, and her team from Port Moresby, the workshop brought together the Simbu Provincial Administration, the Simbu Provincial Health Authority (PHA), and local human resource officers to begin implementing the new system aimed at improving workforce capability and performance.
Mrs. Yuki explained that the program is designed to provide a structured approach to assessing staff competencies, identifying training gaps, and guiding investment in skill development.
“Our visitation here is to pioneer Simbu Provincial Administration and Simbu PHA to start implementing and utilizing this system — assessing needs and analysis to develop their training plan.”
She said the impact of the program is significant, as it introduces a more systematic and constructive way of identifying skill and competency gaps within provincial organisations.
“This is basically a system we would like to introduce throughout the public service, and by starting with Simbu PHA and PA, we hope to set the foundation for independent and objective training assessments,” added Mrs Yuki.
Simbu Provincial Administration’s principal advisor for Human Resources, Alois Siune, commended the DPM team for introducing the program, calling it a timely and much-needed initiative.
“This is the first of its kind being done here. We’ve had training before, but not as active due to certain constraints. Now that DPM has come on board with AusAID to run this program, it will help us identify real training needs and conduct the right programs accordingly.”
The session concluded with participants committing to implement the CAN program across all provincial departments, ensuring Simbu’s public servants are better equipped to deliver effective and quality services to their communities."
"Grey listing unavoidable, says Barker",21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6527,"The Institute of National Affairs Executive Director, Paul Barker and a noted economic analyst, has indicated that Papua New Guinea is likely to face grey listing next February, a situation he describes as unavoidable.
Mr Barker told this newsroom that despite this challenging outlook, Barker stressed the importance of focusing on mitigating the impact by striving to limit the duration of the grey listing.
“At this stage it really looks virtually impossible to avoid grey listing next February.
“The challenging, rather, will be to seek to limit the duration of grey-listing to as short a period as possible,” said Barker.
He suggested that proactive measures and reforms could potentially help reduce the time spent in this status, thereby minimizing its negative implications for the nation’s economy and international reputation.
Barker clarified that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) committee based in the Gulf determines grey listing for countries, based upon a set of criteria.
“The rules, which are designed to protect the soundness of the global financial system, includes requirements for monitoring and compliance, which includes prosecution where offences are occurring to ensure deterrence.
“PNG has introduced extensive relevant legislation against money laundering, proceeds of crime, whistle-blower, unexplained wealth, and anti-corruption laws, with new bodies including FASU and ICAC.”
“It has strengthened its monitoring and oversight capacity, working closely with banks, which have reinforced AML capacity. The cooperation and coordination capacity between responsible authorities has also been stepped up.”
However, he said to date, there have been no prosecutions where offences have occurred, and extensive offences or suspected offences have been identified, so there have been no penalties or deterrence effect, as the police fraud squad has had little capacity (or inclination) to prosecute cases referred to it by FASU, and ICAc has not been functioning long enough to handle cases, although it has started.
He explained that the FATF requires at least two years of evidenced prosecutions which is not happening.
“So, the issue is building up a track record of oversight and governance, and show that to be the case consistently.
“Other potential money laundering devices, using a new casino and alluvial gold, will also require better oversight.”"

The National Court on Monday, October 20, dismissed review application. The decision was made by Justice Susan Purdon-Sully, dismissing Sonk’s application for a judicial review for being an abuse of process.
The National Court decision confirms the legal standing of the KPHL Board led by Chairman Gerea Aopi, appointed by Prime Minister James Marape as sole trustee on behalf of the State; the Board's suspension of Sonk and its appointment of Luke Liria as Acting Managing Director.

The ruling noted, ""the application for leave for judicial review is dismissed as an abuse of court process.""
Chairman Aopi said, ""The Board is pleased with the ruling, and the judgement's comprehensive analysis and consideration of all the actions taken by various interested parties over the last few months, after the issue of the appointment instrument. This demonstrates the integrity of our civil democratic processes.""
""The Board of KPHL is now free to pursue its role in overseeing the activities of this important industry entity, and in doing so we will hopefully restore public trust in its operations and pursuance of its vision to create value and opportunity from the nation's petroleum resources for Papua New Guinea and its people.""
""Whatever public perceptions or opinion may be, the KPHL Board has always abided by the rule of law, a practice we intend to continue in the coming years of our tenure; to always act in the best interests of KPHL,” said Aopi.
He stated that going forward, the Board intends to follow normal good governance practice and ensure accountability for all KPHL's actions and activities, including any changes that may be necessary in company management.
“This is particularly important at this present time in the lead up to the long-awaited announcement of the Final Investment Decision for the Papua LNG Project by Total Energies,"" Aopi added."
Kieta (Aropa) Airport Undergoes Essential Maintenance and Upgrades,20/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6517,"The National Airports Corporation (NAC) wishes to advise the travelling public and stakeholders that temporary restrictions will be in place at Kieta (Aropa) Airport in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville to allow for essential maintenance and upgrade works on the airside.

This investment will see the delivery of new accommodation and essential services for up to 200 additional PNGDF trainees, with an expected completion in late 2026.
The upgraded training facilities will see an increase in the number of recruit and career courses that can be run concurrently.
Australia will also work in close collaboration with PNG on a design for a new PNGDF infantry battalion barracks in Hela Province.
This work would ensure that a similar design concept could be applied and adapted to other locations across PNG.
Interoperability between the two defence forces is a priority under the new Alliance.
The Ministers further agreed to identify common land force capabilities that will enable our militaries to work even more closely together.
Shared capabilities will streamline standard operating procedures and maximise training opportunities during military exercises.
They have agreed to further uplift PNGDF’s capability through the provision of Australian-made combat rifles.
The rollout of replacement weapons will include further work on armories and additional steps to enhance weapons security.
Australia and PNG will also expand defence aviation cooperation by building on current pilot, aircrew, and aircraft maintenance training initiatives under the Flights of Excellence program.
From 2026, Australia will support the training of up to six pilots from the PNGDF each year to build their air capacity, in addition to training for engineers and other air crew.
A strong aviation safety culture is crucial to our commitment to build a sustainable sovereign air capability with PNG.
Our Alliance is a natural evolution of our close and longstanding defence ties, seen earlier this year when PNG hosted the first ever component of exercise Talisman Sabre outside Australia, and last week with the involvement of three Army Chinook helicopters in Exercise Wantok Warrior – which has been conducted every year since 2009.
The Pukpuk Treaty will take this to the next level.
The alliance reflects our commitment to each other and to a region that is peaceful, stable and prosperous.
Together, Australia and PNG will continue to build unique partnership for the betterment of the two nations and their people."
Why PNGUoT’s dining hall cost more,20/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6510,"The Papua New Guinea University of Technology’s (PNGUoT) new dining hall cost more than what was initally budgeted due to the contractor’s financial incapabilities.
Chancellor Sam Koim repeated that because the project went beyond its deadline by three years, the cost of the project – including associated costs – had inflated the project value.
The initial value of PNGUoT’s dining hall project, which was K17.4 million, was awarded by the National Executive Council to a local contractor, who started construction in April 2021. The project was expected to be completed by August 2022.
“But after the contract was awarded – and let me be frank here, the payment was paid in full but what we received was 65 percent of the project,” outlined Chancellor Sam Koim during the recent opening of their K30 million dining hall.
“And this is something that I would like to highlight here – nothing disparaging to the contractor but – I’d like to make this point that Papua New Guinean contractors need to learn to deliver contracts according to scope, design and value for money.
“Papua New Guinean contractors think that as soon as the first instalment, mobilisation is given or the second phase payment is given, they think that it’s their profit already. And they take that money and use it all over the place and leave the contract unattended to.
“And this is a classic example of a lesson we’ve learnt the hard way.”
Due to the incomplete work, PNGUoT allocated an additional K10 million from its own savings to complete the project.
Other areas, aside from construction, had to be funded as well, including the setting up of the temporary mess operations, together with kitchen equipment, modern kitchen equipment and furniture for the new dining hall, the legal costs of defending the dispute arising out of contract termination of the failed contract, and the impacts of inflation and exchange rates caused by years of delay from the contractor’s failure to deliver.
“The university had to outsource catering services to a private contractor,” continued Koim.
“That catering work costed us about K16 million a year. And at that time, we decided to part ways with the private contractor. It was very challenging but we took the decisive step to terminate the contract with the catering services.
“We took it on board and since then, we’ve save K9 million every year after we’ve terminated that contract. So, for the last six years, we’ve saved over K50 million.”
“It is one great achievement for the university,” said an emotional vice chancellor, Professor Ora Renagi.
“I will take pictures and go show the development partners, even the government departments, that look at this; Unitech has been able to persistently drive this project to completion. And today, we are very proudly standing at the university, showing everybody that we can deliver.
“Come and work with us. Come and partner with us. Come and join us, and let’s build our university to world standards.”"
Alotau receives medical supplies by road,20/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6509,"A milestone was achieved when medical supplies to the Milne Bay Provincial Health Authority were delivered by road from Port Moresby recently.
Minister for Health Elias Kapavore said this is history brought about by the Government’s flagship Connect PNG program.
Minister Kapavore said Express Custom Logistics (ECL), the Southern Region Logistics Distribution contractor, was engaged by the Health Department to deliver these supplies.
“Two Isuzu dyna, and two open-back land cruisers trucks loaded with 620 cartons earmarked for the Milne Bay Provincial Health Authority.  Thank you to the Minister for Works and Highways, but especially, giving credit to the flagship, Connect PNG program by the Marape-Rosso Government,” Minister Kapavore said.
After 17 hours of navigating the long stretch of road between Port Moresby and Alotau, the delivery team arrived safely at 6:30 pm in Alotau.
Chief Executive Officer of Milne Bay Provincial Health Authority, Dr. Perista Mamadi, confirmed that the delivery team had to cross three big rivers on the Milne Bay side to get to the province.
“I was worried for the Abau side because of the mud, but it was dry. On the Milne Bay side, the team had to cross three rivers. One of the rivers was high, so they had to put off the engines and pull the vehicles across the river. They did well and arrived at 6:30 pm, Saturday, at the ECL warehouse,” Dr Mamadi said.
This morning, the ECL delivered the medical supplies to the Milne Bay PHA Medical Store. They are now at Alotau Provincial Hospital to load the empty oxygen cylinders."

Retired teachers' entitlements paid,19/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6500,"The Department of Treasury has released K19.5 million as final entitlements and repatriation funds to 570 retired teachers in Papua New Guinea.
The employer of teachers, the Teaching Service Commission (TSC), confirmed this long-awaited news to teachers who visited Vulupindi Haus, Port Moresby, on Thursday, October 16, 2025, to inquire about their payments.
TSC Commissioner Operation, Maini Mike Ugaia, on behalf of 70,000 teachers, including retirees, thanked the Department of Treasury for making this payment available.
He said this is the 3rd batch of retiree payments.
Ugaia said these 570 retirees will receive their payment before the end of this year. He told the retirees present that the payment process had been slow due to the involvement of multiple agencies and the need for due diligence.
However, Ugaia assured them that retirees would now receive their entitlements. The repatriation payment applies only to retired teachers, not resigned teachers, says TSC.
“Retiring means you have served this country until you are 60 years old, and as a token of appreciation, we pay you your entitlements along with repatriation,” he said. Due to the lengthy time frame and challenges faced by retired teachers, TSC’s involvement since 2024 aims to resolve issues among teachers, provinces, and the Treasury.
Ugaia said that TSC’s Industrial Team is working on the next batch of retirees' entitlements. Once it is done, the files will be sent to the Treasury Department for funding.
He extended his gratitude to Treasury, the Department of Education, and TSC officers for their dedication to the process.
TSC Principal Advisor Industrial, Esban Rita Karo, urged Salaries Officers from all the provinces to compile exit files for all outstanding exits and also recently approved exits from their provinces and send them to TSC Headquarters so calculations can be checked and included for the funding bid to the Treasury Department.
“The files contain the teachers' records from the day when they were first admitted into the Teaching Service, and we also check the salary history to ensure they have not taken furlough leave, because if they have taken furlough leave, service paid would be from the date they resume teaching after the furlough. That’s the reason why we are insisting that the files must come,” Mrs Karo said.
She said this applies to exit members who were already in service before 2003 when the Alesco system was introduced. Teachers who started teaching in 2003 and current have their records in the system, making it easier to review their records.
The TSC expressed appreciation to the retirees for their years of service to Papua New Guinea, and also for their patience in waiting for their entitlements to be paid."
LOs urged to work in unity for LNG benefits,19/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6499,"Prime Minister James Marape has called on landowners from the PNG LNG project areas to resolve ongoing disputes, to enable the release of over K800 million currently held in trust for their benefit.
Speaking in Tari following the signing of the PNG LNG gas-fired power supply Memorandum of Understanding on Friday, October 17, Prime Minister Marape said while some 30 court cases among various landowner groups are before the courts, the Government is ready to pay out funds to undisputed clans whose entitlements have been verified.
He said more than K800 million has been transferred into trust accounts for landowners.
“We are ready to release these funds to those clans and land groups that have no disputes. For those who are still in dispute, I appeal to you to resolve your issues quickly — either through the courts or through mutual settlement — so everyone can benefit.”
The Prime Minister stated that the lengthy court battles have postponed much-needed benefits to legitimate landowners and called on all parties to act in the national interest.
“This is the money our economy needs,” he said. “It should not be sitting idle in the banks while our people continue to struggle. Once released, this money will circulate through our economy — to build homes, start businesses, and improve lives across the project areas.”
Prime Minister Marape also appealed to the judiciary to expedite the hearing of landowner cases, ensuring that legitimate recipients can access their funds without further delay.
Meantime, in bringing government services closer to Hela, Prime Minister Marape also opened the Hela Haus 2 building in Tari. The building will house key government and commercial offices to decentralise essential services back to the province.
The ground floor of the new modern facility will host a BSP Financial Group branch, while the upper floors will accommodate offices for:
• Mineral Resources Development Company
• Department of Petroleum
• Internal Revenue Commission
• Investment Promotion Authority
“I do not want our landowners and citizens travelling to Port Moresby to look for government offices,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“The government must come back and live in Hela Province. We are building modern offices so that our people can access services directly at home, where the oil and gas resources come from.”
He commended Governor Philip Undialu and the Hela Provincial Government for using royalty and development levy funds responsibly to invest in modern infrastructure, and MRDC for taking up office space to serve landowners more effectively."

Pacific pilgrims arrive in Rome ahead of P Blessed Peter To Rot’s Canonisation,18/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6484,"Pilgrims and bishops from Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Solomon Islands have arrived in Rome in anticipation for the canonisation of Blessed Peter To Rot, set to take place this Sunday. The historic event, which will see To Rot and six other Blesseds elevated to sainthood by the Catholic Church, has drawn a large contingent of faithfuls from across the Pacific and around the globe to the Vatican.
Upon arrival in Rome, the pilgrims joined thousands of others from different corners of the world, all converging at St. Peter's Square and the surrounding areas to celebrate this significant occasion.
In this article, written by Sr Daisy Lisania who is also in the Vatican, “The atmosphere is one of great joy and anticipation as participants prepare for the solemn canonisation ceremony, which will be led by Pope Leo XlV”.
At the forefront of the Vatican's preparations, the pictures of seven saints, including Peter To Rot, to be canonised this Sunday, are prominently displayed on the front wall of St. Peter's Basilica. These striking portraits serve as a visual tribute to the diverse and inspiring lives of those being elevated to sainthood, representing different cultures, countries, and spiritual legacies.
In addition to ToRot’s canonisation, the event underscores the universal nature of the Catholic faith, with people from every corner of the globe coming together to honour the lives of these remarkable men and women. The presence of bishops and pilgrims from PNG and the Solomon Islands is particularly significant, highlighting the deep-rooted Catholic tradition in the Pacific region.
For the people of PNG and the Solomon Islands, Peter To Rot’s canonisation is a monumental moment in their spiritual journey, commemorating the courage and unwavering faith of a man who stood firm in his beliefs, even in the face of persecution.
Blessed Peter To Rot was executed by the Japanese during World War II for his role in leading the Catholic community in Papua New Guinea. His legacy as a martyr and symbol of resilience has made a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the faithful worldwide.
As pilgrims gather in Rome to witness this historic event, many are reflecting on the significance of To Rot’s sainthood, while also celebrating the strength and unity of the global Catholic community. The canonisation ceremony is expected to attract a vast crowd, with thousands of faithful expected to fill St. Peter’s Square, eagerly awaiting the moment when Peter To Rot is officially declared a saint.
The festivities will continue through the weekend, with special Masses and prayers held across Rome in tribute to the new saints, culminating in the canonisation Mass on Sunday."
Disgruntled students query subsidy payment,18/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6483,"The Eastern Highlands Students Union at the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) is demanding fairness in school fee subsidy from the Eastern Highlands Provincial Government. Union president Millan Usoni said while it is not a right, the school fee subsidy program should cover students attending UPNG too.
According to Usoni, the provincial government has subsidized school fees for EHP students attending tertiary institutions in the country, except UPNG.
In a media release dated 15th October, the provincial government stated that its students attending UPNG would have received their portion of the subsidy had the university not done away with bulk deposits or payments.
Provincial Simon Sia said, “Our officers have communicated with the UPNG Bursars' office to find out suitable ways to pay the fees for students.”
“Even they don't bother to respond to our call. Who is at fault?
“The payment has been made online, and student leaders are asked to check with their Finance team. A total K343,500.00 was paid for 173 students who applied and met all the requirements of the subsidy program.
“Student leaders must check with the school Bursar and confirm that the remittance advice received from the Premium Banking confirms the funds being deposited into the UPNG account,” Sia said.
He added that the provincial government made the deposit into the university account on October 6, 2025 and that the money should already be cleared. He urged student leaders to follow up on the payment.
The student union refutes that any payment was made into the university account after checking with the school bursar. The students urge the provincial government to rectify this issue before they can go home for the holidays."
Advanced coconut processing hub,18/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6482,"The recent announcement by Minister Richard Maru regarding a Coconut Downstream Processing Hub in Madang province, specifically proposed for Siar, has sparked a strong, immediate counter-commentary from retired PNGDF Major Tony Dibul.
Mr.Dibul is from Karkar Island of Sumkar District in Madang province, which is the largest coconut producing district with a total of one million coconuts out of three million in the province. He is also a farmer himself and speaking on behalf of his community and the islanders of Karkar.
Mr. Dibul states that while the intention to establish value added coconut production is commendable, the selection of Siar or anywhere on the Madang mainland is profoundly ill informed and this demonstrates a critical failure to consult local expertise and recognize the undisputed epicenter of Madang’s and indeed Papua New Guineas coconut industry: Karkar Island.
“Any serious program for value added coconut end products in PNG must, first and foremost, be anchored where the resource is most abundant, secure and established. That location is Karkar Island in the Sumkar district,” he said.
Captain Dibul added that Karkar Islands dominance in coconut production is not up for debate. Karkar is reputed to host approximately one third of all coconut trees in PNG, with continuous new seedling propagation reinforcing this massive supply base. Within Madang Province, Sumkar (Karkar) dominates the coconut sector, as the mainland lacks significant dedicated coconut plantations. This sheer volume of raw material makes Karkar the logistical and economic imperative.
Furthermore, Karkar’s geographical isolation provides a crucial non-negotiable advantage: biosecurity. History shows that devastating crop diseases like the Bogia Coconut Syndrome (BCS) and the Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB) have found it difficult to establish and spread on the island. Establishing a major processing hub on the mainland, close to other areas of vulnerability is an unnecessary and significant risk to the entire investment.
He elaborates more on the argument that Karkar is too remote or lacks the necessary infrastructure is simply false, outdated or misleading.
•	Production maturity: Karkar boasts a unique ecosystem of large, established coconut producing plantations operating in tandem with dedicated local block holder farmers, ensuring a diverse and consistent supply chain.
•	Infrastructure advantage: Karkar already possesses essential agricultural infrastructure, which would significantly reduce project start-up costs compared to building entirely new facilities at Siar.
•	Logistical capacity: Crucially, Karkar already has National Maritime Safety Authority (NMSA) rated wharfage and facilities capable of berthing overseas shipping direct. This bypasses unnecessary double handling and trans-shipment costs from the island to the mainland and then to an international port, streamlining export logistics.
•	Advanced product provenance: Karkar is already far superior in the production of advanced coconut products. The presence of ventures like Kulili Estates Bio Fuel demonstrates local capacity and expertise in moving beyond copra to high-value goods like cosmetics, detergents, fuel and lubricants. This is 110 years of life experience with the coconut tree being manifested.
“For Karkar, coconut and Karkar are synonymous. The island’s entire economy and identity are sheltered and sustained by the coconut tree – it’s not just a cash crop; it’s a way of life. There is the need for consultation and accountability.
Minister Maru’s method of announcement and selection overriding local knowledge and without demonstratable consultation with Madang leaders, is deeply concerning. The People’s First Party (PFP) cannot be allowed to dictate and ride roughshod over the backs of Madang’s elected representatives and traditional custodians of the resource.
The Minister’s track record in Madang which includes failure to deliver on the promised Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) and the much-lauded Vidar Special Economic Zone (SEZ), casts a long shadow. Now, he is championing an SEZ at Siar for this coconut venture.
Given this history on non-delivery on major projects, Madang must not allow the Minister and PFP to unilaterally determine the location of a key provincial investment,” Mr. Dibul stated.
In concluding his oratory Captain Dibul demands fairness for Karkar island stating that the logical, economical and practical choice for the Advanced Coconut end product processing facility is undeniably Karkar Island. To place the factory on the Madang mainland, specifically at Siar, when the primary high volume, secure raw material source is an island possessing the necessary port, infrastructure and advanced processing expertise, is an irrational decision.
“The factory is an opportunity to directly empower the 110 years of coconut life experience that defines Karkar. It is only fair and fitting that the processing bub be built where the coconut is king, where the production is proven, and where the logistical framework is already in place.
Therefore, the Minister and Governor Pariwa must rescind the current plan and consult with the people and leaders of Sumkar to establish the hub on Karkar Island – the rightful home of PNG’s coconut industry,” he stressed."
National Exams Remain; Selections to be Phased Out,17/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6475,"Education Secretary Dr. Uke Kombra has clarified the future of student assessments, stating that while national examinations will continue as a necessary part of the education system, the process of selecting students for the next grade level is being changed.
Speaking on the department's plans, Dr. Kombra confirmed that the system of 'graded accumulations’ will remain, meaning students' overall performance will still be recorded and tracked.
Selections however are being ""phased out"" - a move understood to be part of the government's push to achieve Universal Basic Education, allowing more students to complete full 13 years of schooling up to Grade 12.
Dr. Kombra reassured the public that the core function of testing would not be removed.
""Exam will still remain!""
He explained that after teachers deliver the content, they must assess students through class tests and term tests to see how much they have learned.
""Then we have a national test to compare,"" Dr. Kombra noted, highlighting the need for a national standard. This is to ensure fairness and to test students’ capability and ability to move to other grades respectively.
""We do a national exam to see which ones are really, really doing a real test, assessment, and teaching and all that. So that's part of the learning process,"" he stated.
The purpose of these exams is to assess students' actual achievement of the course content.
In conclusion, Dr. Kombra emphasised that as long as the education system exists, the process of assessment and examinations will always be a part of it."
IMPACT Health Project restructure,16/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6470,"The World Bank-financed “Improving Access to and Value from Health Services in PNG: Financing the Frontlines (IMPACT Health)” Project, implemented by the National Department of Health (NDoH), held a Special Project Steering Committee (PSC) meeting in Port Moresby recently to discuss a possible project restructure and extension.
The PSC meeting was chaired by Manah Dindi, Acting Deputy Secretary for National Health Policy and Corporate Services, on behalf of the Project Director, Acting Health Secretary Ken Wai.
The main agenda was to seek endorsement and approval from the Project Steering Committee for a project restructure and extension, including a change to the project end date, to allow sufficient time for the implementation of two large-scale contracts valued at US$11.8 million and US$2.4 million respectively - representing 47 percent of the total project cost.
These contracts include the purchase of medical equipment for 157 health facilities and the refurbishment of 16 health facilities across the four project provinces.
The request to change the current project closing date from June 30, 2026, to June 1, 2028, is based on the understanding that the two large-scale contracts will undergo the appropriate government procurement procedures and obtain the necessary authorizations, with signing expected by December 1, 2025.
The IMPACT Health Project is a US$30 million initiative that underscores the importance of strengthening the quality and utilization of frontline service delivery using existing government systems. It focuses on enhancing primary health care in rural and remote communities within the project provinces, while also providing tools and financing to Provincial Health Authorities (PHAs) to improve service delivery and capacity.
The project introduces a Performance-Based Financing system known as Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs), designed to align incentives between the national, provincial, and facility levels of health care delivery.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) — to increase the utilization of quality essential health services in the project-supported provinces of East New Britain, Central, East Sepik, and Simbu — remains unchanged. Under the key PDOs:
Level 2–4 Health Facilities achieving a Minimum Service Quality Score: Out of 157 facilities surveyed, 149 were assessed, and 85% (126 out of 149) achieved a Minimum Service Quality Score of 60% or above.
Percentage increase in outreach clinics conducted: 16,327 outreach visits were conducted between July 2024 and June 30, 2025 — a 78% increase over the baseline (target for Year 4: 10,990).
Percentage increase in pregnant women receiving four or more antenatal care check-ups: 15,652 women attended their fourth antenatal care visit between July 2024 and June 30, 2025  - a 13% increase over the baseline.
Percentage increase in children under one year receiving the Pentavalent 3rd vaccine: 38,030 children under one year received the vaccine between July 2024 and June 30, 2025  - an 87% increase over the baseline.
The two major contracts pending implementation under the IMPACT Health Project include: Health Facility Audit and Investment Contract – covering facility audits, supply of medical equipment, and refurbishment of selected health facilities.
Upskilling and Community Engagement Contract – aimed at strengthening workforce capacity and community participation in health initiatives.
The NDoH, through the National Health Service Standards and Facility Branch and National Health Policy and Corporate Services Division, will play a key role in implementing these contracts, supported by the IMPACT Health Project team in providing oversight and coordination.
The special PSC meeting was attended by NDoH Senior Executive Management (SEM) and representatives from key central government agencies, including the Department of National Planning and Monitoring (DNPM), Department of Treasury (DoT), Department of Finance (DoF), and the National Procurement Commission (NPC)."
A faith-driven approach to youth and child welfare,16/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6465,"During a formal inquiry into social services for children and youth, held by the Special Parliamentary Committee on Children and Youth on October 14–15 2025, Chimbu Provincial Member Noah Kool reaffirmed Chimbu’s commitment to faith-based development as a cornerstone of provincial progress.
The inquiry, chaired by NCD Governor Powes Parkop and hosted by the National Department for Community Development, provided a platform for provinces to share innovative approaches to youth and child welfare.
Kool used the session to highlight Chimbu’s “Back to God” initiative — a homegrown program that predates the national Christian Country policy as a model for integrating faith into development.
“Before Parliament passed the policy, Chimbu had already gone back to God,” he said.
Under the initiative, the province has supported over 110 churches with logistical resources, including vehicles for the Body of Christ in each district.
“We’re now replicating this model across the province,” Kool said, emphasizing that churches are not only spiritual leaders but also frontline partners in delivering health, education, and social services.
One million kina from the Provincial Services Improvement Program (PSIP) has been allocated to church organizations, a move Kool described as ‘true partnership’. He stressed that faith-based groups are ‘uniquely positioned to reach communities where government services are stretched thin.
“This is the foundation we’re building on,” he said. “Churches are helping us move forward.”
The inquiry underscored the growing recognition of churches as development actors — not just in Chimbu, but across the country — as provinces seek holistic, community-rooted solutions to youth and child welfare."
Kombra addresses exam cheating,15/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6461,"Secretary for Education Dr. Uke Kombra today addressed the media regarding the leakage of examination papers and answer sheets to students before exams.
This follows reports that exam papers and answer sheets were accessed by students of Ivingoi Secondary School in Okapa, Eastern Highlands Province. The school was reported to have committed cheating; however, the department has yet to establish the point of entry for investigation and identify the extent of the leakage.
Secretary Kombra stated that his team is working around the clock to find the extent of the leakage and establish the point of entry.
Cheating in examinations through having access to exam papers and answer sheets before exams is one of the serious academic crimes in PNG, and has come to light since 2012.
Dr. Uke Kombra put this issue as a key task to mitigate.
Secretary Kombra said the entire act of stealing and selling of exam papers is a serious crime and is punishable by law. He said there were instances in the past years where students were reprimanded by the authorities, charged and jailed.
“Students and teachers who are involved in cheating will be terminated on the spot without proper documentation of release,” said Dr Kombra.
He urged parents and students to report any information on the illegal selling of exam papers and sheets in their neighborhood.
While reports circulated on social media, Dr. Kombra stressed that the department is still investigating the Ivingoi incident to pinpoint the source.
Dr. Kombra said his team is working fast to find out how much information was leaked and where the breach started. He warned parents and students not to take part in this illegal activity.
He said students and teachers involved in cheating will be fired immediately.
Dr. Kombra urged parents and students to report any information they have about the illegal sale of exam papers in their communities.
He added that the Ministry of Education is committed to protecting the integrity of the country’s education system and ensuring that learning and exams are not ruined by criminal acts."
Australia Gov’t support elevates rural women,15/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6460,"On this International Day of Rural Women, the Australian Government recognises and celebrates the important contribution rural women make across Papua New Guinea.
The Australian Government is proud to support Papua New Guinean women through the Lily Magazine Homemade Competition. The Competition has proven to be a platform for ingenuity, empowering rural women to build sustainable businesses using local resources.
Competition finalists receive business development training and an eight-week tailored mentoring program, equipping them with practical knowledge to transform innovative ideas into viable enterprises.
Competition finalists Denise Aitoba and Nicola Boas have expanded their skills and confidence through the program.
Denise Aitoba, a pineapple farmer from Butibam, Morobe Province, is turning thorny pineapple leaves into intricate fibre jewellery. For Denise, who had postponed her business studies to raise a family, the training was a ‘second chance’ to develop her knowledge and skills.
“I didn't know just how much this competition would change my life, especially to go on and attend the business training. It built my confidence,” Denise said.
Her business is now a family affair, engaging her sisters and creating local employment. She has connected with other finalists, including as Nicola Boas, the category winner for the competition's edible category.
Nicola, a forester by profession, is tapping into Papua New Guinea’s rich biodiversity by transforming the vibrant Butterfly Pea flower - lauded for its health benefits - into herbal salts, tea and juice. Nicola shared her inspiration, when she discovered the plant while working in the Markham Valley.
“I was amazed by the blue colour,” Nicola shared. “I believe in the power of integrating these natural 'superfoods' into daily diets.”
Nicola and Denise have now teamed up, joining and inspiring other women in local villages and communities in Morobe to promote their products and offer support to women who want to start small, informal businesses. The competition has fostered a crucial support network, with Denise and Nicola mentoring, celebrating, and supporting each other to expand their customer reach.
Over the past five years, the Australian Government’s investment in the Lily Magazine Homemade Competition has supported women like Denise, Nicola, and many others to launch and grow businesses that harness eco-friendly local resources.
These efforts are contributing to a more inclusive, sustainable future—one powered by the innovation, resilience, and leadership of Papua New Guinea’s rural women."
PM Marape commends Wantok Radio Light,15/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6459,"Prime Minister James Marape has commended Wantok Radio Light for its enduring role in spreading positive, faith-based messages across Papua New Guinea, describing it as an “instrument of hope” that uplifts hearts and guides young people toward productive and meaningful lives.
Speaking during a visit to the Wantok Radio Light studios on the occasion of its 24th anniversary, the Prime Minister highlighted the vital importance of media that nurtures the moral and spiritual wellbeing of the nation.
“What our people hear, watch, and see influences their hearts and their direction in life,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“That is why stations like Wantok Radio Light are so important — to make sure the right voices, the right music, and the right messages are heard.”
He cautioned that in today’s fast-changing world, young people are being shaped by secular and sometimes harmful influences online and on social media.
“We must fill the airwaves and digital spaces with good content that uplifts the soul,” he said. “Wantok Radio Light is doing exactly that — using technology to carry words that heal, inspire, and guide people back to faith and purpose.”
Marape also reaffirmed his government’s commitment to supporting church-led and faith-based initiatives that build human capital and empower communities.
He said the Government will continue to back programmes such as Second Chance Education, Continuing Education, SME Training, and Labour Mobility Pathways, all of which align with the broader Christian and social development agenda.
“Many of our youth have dropped out of school or lost their way,” the Prime Minister said. “Stations like Wantok Radio Light can help us reach them — to tell them there is still a path forward through education, work, and faith.”
He noted that the Government’s partnerships with institutions and development partners, including Australia, are designed to open employment and training pathways for young Papua New Guineans both at home and abroad.
“When our young people go out to work, learn new skills, and come back home to serve their communities, that is nation-building in action,” he said.
The Prime Minister further described churches and faith-based media as the “watchmen of society,” guiding national conscience and moral direction.
While the Government cannot directly run every radio station, he said, it stands ready to support good initiatives that promote national values and positive content.
“Churches have always been our moral compass. You reach into the homes, the hearts, and the minds of our people — often where government cannot. Our partnership must continue to strengthen the moral fabric of our country.”
He urged Wantok Radio Light and other Christian broadcasters to keep telling stories of faith, success, and national progress.
“Go out and share the good news of what’s happening in our communities — our young people succeeding, our families growing stronger, our nation moving forward,” Prime Minister Marape said. “Positive stories are the light that overcomes darkness.”
In closing, Prime Minister Marape said Papua New Guinea’s progress depends not only on physical infrastructure, but also on the spiritual and moral foundations of its people.
“We must continue to speak life, hope, and faith into our nation,” he said. “Let us use every radio frequency, every social media channel, and every platform to share messages that unite and build up our people. Together — church, media, and government — we can shape a stronger, God-fearing Papua New Guinea for the next 50 years and beyond.”"
837 DWU undergraduates missioned,15/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6455,"Divine Word University graduates will attest that receiving the cross during missioning validates graduating from the institution. This year marks the 17th Missioning ceremony for 837 students who will graduate next year.
The cross not only indicates their eligibility for graduation, but it also signifies a customary ritual of sending out its ambassadors to the world, equipped with the institution's ethics, values and principles.
Families, friends, and parents were able to witness this ceremony themed “Living our noble traditions and Christian principles” and take their loved ones back home to face the world after four years at the Divine Word University in Madang province.
President of DWU Professor Fr. Philip Gibbs said the missioning was a time of Thanksgiving, appreciation, and blessing which will be given to students in a cross.
Fr. Gibbs elaborated that the event will bring many joyous moments with family and friends, some may be sad, and others will feel indifferent. This goes to show how they will approach life after university, and some may tackle the unknown full head-on, whilst others may tread along with caution.
He also encouraged the missioning students to reflect on the blessings that they had received while being students of DWU. Their support from families, friends, and the DWU community, and how fortunate they have been during their studies at the institution.
The President reminded them that life is full of opportunities and they should never lose hope or sight of their goals. Being equipped with the tools to take on life’s journey and how they can make a positive impact on developing the country.
The to-be graduates were reminded of their purpose in life and to fulfill that purpose in becoming agents of change and development.
“Making Papua New Guinea a better place for everybody. The cross that you will receive is a symbol of Gods power within you, guiding you to make wise ethical decisions in all the things you do,” Fr. Gibbs stated.
Keynote speaker, Ps. Veneo Kario of the Foursquare Church congratulated the students on their accomplishment and for the ceremony dedicated to their achievements. He pointed out to the students that they were lucky to be celebrated and to be blessed to go out as ambassadors of DWU. He encouraged the missioning students to be thankful and just as the country celebrated its 50 years, much emphasis was put on the word “reset”.
Ps. Kario encouraged students to go out into the world and make their mark in the country’s clean slate for the next 50 years.
“It is your time to write out history as the country stands at the threshold of the next 50 years. Madang was recognized as having the best independence celebrations, even though Port Moresby had spectacular events. This goes to show how you can also impact positively wherever you may go,” Ps. Kario said."

Logea Nao, speaking on behalf of the women researchers, said: “As PNG enters into the next 50 years, the strengthening research capacity for women researchers is a fitting investment by the government and the people of Australia, not just for strengthening research capacity, but broadly for strengthening research collaboration, and by extension, strengthening people-to-people links between Australia and PNG. So on behalf of the 12 awardees, I say thank you.”
Fellow researcher Imelda Atu added that the women researchers appreciated being allowed to participate in this program.
“I am pretty sure we will go down there, and we will learn a lot. When we come back, we will be able to share and also network with other fellow researchers, as well as what knowledge and skills that we have gained from them. We are looking into collaborating with other women researchers,” she said.
The program encourages ongoing collaboration among participants, including sharing ideas, resources, and experiences. This emerging network will help build lasting connections and support peer learning beyond the formal training.
The capacity building program complements other Australian Government-supported initiatives aimed at advancing inclusive economic growth in Papua New Guinea."

I was proud of the first half; we were defending a lot for the first half, but at the start of the second half, we had some chances to put some scores on the Australians. But overall, I am happy with some of the experienced and some of the young players,” said Demetriou.
He commended the team for their resilience and efforts to turn away the Australians on numerous occasions and had to dig deep to score points.
Ahead of the Pacific Championships, Demetriou reveals plans that there will be changes to the team to accommodate big-name players for this week’s line-up.
“The plan is to take some lessons out of this game; there’ll be some quality players coming in. Rhys Martin, who was involved in the Super League grand final, is looking forward to getting back, Lachy Lam and Alex Johnston.”
PNG Kumuls will have a two-week turnaround to prepare for their Bowl title defense against the Cook Islands on October 25 and the Fiji Bati on November 1.

Police intercepted the dinghy upon arrival at Sawoi village and found freshly dried marijuana neatly packed in plastic bags, weighing around 65kg. The suspects were immediately arrested and taken to Saidor Police Station for questioning.
Madang Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim, commended the actions of Saidor police and the community for the timely information that led to the arrest.
“This is a major drug haul, and we appreciate the cooperation from locals who reported the matter. My warning to smugglers is that Madang is no longer a venue where you can sneak out with your illicit drugs. Policemen and women are working and monitoring both land and sea. Penalties for drug smugglers have increased, so think about it – it’s your family or your illegal drugs; the choice is yours,” PPC Baim said.
The suspects remain in custody and will be transported to Madang to face formal charges at the district court."
"Promoting clean, safe workspaces",13/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6422,"The Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) staff and management took time off from their desks on Tuesday, October 7, to participate in a Cleanathon around the Commission’s office vicinity in Waigani.
The initiative reflects CLRC’s commitment to not only legal reform but also to building a safe, clean, and healthy environment for staff, visitors, and the surrounding community.
While CLRC’s primary mandate is to review and reform Papua New Guinea’s laws, the Commission acknowledges that its role extends beyond legislative work. Corporate social responsibility is an important part of CLRC’s operations, and the Cleanathon serves as a reminder that nation-building begins with small but meaningful actions.
CLRC Secretary Dr. Mange Matui emphasized that the program will be carried out occasionally to ensure the Commission’s workplace remains conducive and welcoming. “A clean and healthy environment is essential not only for productivity but also for the well-being of everyone who interacts with our office. This is our way of giving back to the community, and we intend to make this an occasional practice,” he said.
The Cleanathon is also about teamwork and collective responsibility. Staff from all sections of the Commission worked side by side to clean the office surroundings, demonstrating unity of purpose and the value of shared effort. The activity fostered a sense of pride and ownership among employees, reminding them that maintaining a professional institution begins at home.
Through initiatives such as this, CLRC seeks to promote a culture of cleanliness, wellness, and accountability. It also serves as a visible demonstration of how institutions can contribute to the community in ways that go beyond their mandated functions.
As Papua New Guinea approaches 50 years of nationhood, CLRC believes that embracing both tradition and modern responsibility is essential for progress. Just as law reform strengthens the foundations of democracy, maintaining a clean and healthy environment strengthens the foundation of community and workplace harmony."
Rosso praises rescue of Morobe’s conjoined twins,13/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6420,"Deputy Prime Minister and Member for Lae, John Rosso, has praised the successful emergency transfer of newborn conjoined twin boys from a rural hospital to the city for better care.
Rosso publicly congratulated the team at Braun Hospital in Finschhafen, led by Dr. Kovei Umba, and the air service Manolos Aviation for the successful medical flight.
“I sincerely congratulate the dedicated staff and Manolos Aviation for another successful medivac—this time for a set of conjoined twin boys,” Rosso said in a statement.
The Deputy Prime Minister highlighted the importance of help in remote areas, calling rural aviation and medicine ""close to my heart."" He said he saw many problems when he was a young patrol officer (""kiap"") and is inspired when people and services step up to help.
He pointed to his recent work in the remote Imane village in the Markham District, where he helped reopen the local airstrip and brought in internet service.
Rosso stressed that transport and communication can change the lives of remote families. He noted Manolos Aviation’s long history of service, which includes over 3,000 medical evacuations in the last 16 years.
He called this a ""remarkable record"" that has ""saved countless lives.""
Rosso has promised to continue supporting services like Manolos, Good Samaritan Aviation, and MAF, which are key to a strong rural aviation system.
""I ask all Papua New Guineans to continue keeping these twin boys in our thoughts and prayers, as their doctors navigate the delicate journey that lies ahead,"" he said."
New director for RPNGC internal affairs,13/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6419,"Chief Superintendent Steven Harris has been appointed as the Executive Director of the Internal Affairs Directorate, tasked with investigating and prosecuting misconduct within the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary.
Commissioner Manning said that Chief Superintendent Steven Harris has a program to investigate allegations of corruption and ill-discipline, which, from day one, includes an increase in mandatory alcohol and drug testing.
""Chief Superintendent Harris has more than two decades of experience in leading positions in policing and public service across Australian jurisdictions, and is now a sworn officer within the ranks of the RPNGC,"" Commissioner Manning confirmed.
""He has led specialist investigations and compliance enforcement in Australia and overseas, including the Solomon Islands, as well as a strong background in local policing.
""Immediately following his appointment, Chief Superintendent Harris was engaged with international partners to arrange the supply of alcohol and drug testing equipment.
""The use of alcohol and drugs is a threat to professional policing, and Chief Superintendent Harris is tasked with ensuring such unprofessional and dangerous conduct has no place in our Police Force.
""The more police officers who are detected and dismissed for drugs and alcohol, the greater the public confidence in the Police Force.
""The Internal Affairs Directorate is hard at work and deploying new means to detect drugs and alcohol and take disciplinary action.""
Commissioner Manning said the recruitment of police personnel from overseas jurisdictions has been well received by the police they serve alongside and the broader public.
""Our Commonwealth Police Officers have sworn an oath to protect and serve the people of PNG they serve under and are accountable to the laws of Papua New Guinea,” he said.
""Over recent years, we have already weeded out and dismissed a large number of police that did not have the discipline and ethical standards required of them, and we will maintain that pressure.
""Chief Superintendent Harris will integrate well with his fellow police personnel and lead by example to promote integrity in the force,” Manning added."
"Marape: Chiefs, a symbol of unity",12/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6412,"Prime Minister James Marape described Papua New Guinea’s National Rugby League team name, Chiefs, as a powerful reflection of the country’s deep cultural roots, ancient governance systems, and unity.
The PM revealed the PNG NRL team name this afternoon at the National Football Stadium (NFS) during the PNG and Australia’s PM’s XIII matches in Port Moresby.
Marape said the PNG Chiefs' name is a fitting emblem as the country celebrates 50 years of Independence in 2025, representing both the past and future of leadership in Papua New Guinea.
“Our forefathers and mothers were chiefs who kept order, peace, and balance among our tribes. As we play on the world stage, the PNG Chiefs will carry that same spirit — the strength of unity in diversity.”
The PNG NRL team, expected to enter the competition in 2028, will be based in Port Moresby but will carry a truly national identity, drawing players from all provinces.
The name Chiefs was chosen through a public poll and professional selection process conducted by Digicel, with more than 20 proposed names submitted for consideration.
“Many creative and culturally meaningful names were put forward, including the one I personally proposed,” he said. “After several rounds of assessment, the shortlist came down to five names — PNG Wantoks, PNG Kundus, PNG Pythons, and PNG Chiefs among them. In the final tally, Chiefs emerged as the most preferred and culturally resonant name, carrying both emotional and rational weight for our people.”
Marape thanked everyone who participated in the national name competition and commended the PNG NRL Bid Board for ensuring a transparent, inclusive, and culturally grounded process.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the Australian Government and NRL leadership for their partnership in making PNG’s NRL dream a reality.
He thanked Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for his commitment to strengthening people-to-people ties through sports diplomacy and supporting Papua New Guinea’s bid as part of the broader Australia–Pacific sports partnership.
The Prime Minister also recognised Australia Rugby League Commission chairman, Peter V’landys, NRL Chief Executive Officer Andrew Abdo, and the PNG NRL Bid Board for their leadership, understanding, and approval of the PNG Chiefs name.
“The PNG Chiefs will be a unifying symbol of Pacific strength, friendship, and shared values — a reflection of how sport continues to build bridges between peoples and nations.”
He said the PNG Chiefs’ inclusion in the NRL was not only a sporting achievement but also a nation-building milestone, symbolising PNG’s growing partnership with Australia and the Pacific region.
“Our Chiefs will represent the unity and pride of our nation on the world stage.”"
Road Brings Hope Home,12/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6407,"A newly rehabilitated road in the Sepik region has transformed the lives of nearly 1,900 rural families, bringing markets, schools, and hospitals within reach — and turning mud-slicked isolation into mobility, safety, and opportunity.
The 17.63-kilometer Bonohoi–Asanakor road, upgraded by the International Labour Organization (ILO) under the EU-STREIT PNG Programme as part of the European Union’s Global Gateway Strategy, has become a vital lifeline for communities in the Ambunti–Drekikier and Maprik Districts.
Before the upgrade, the road was a muddy trail where women in labour were carried on stretchers, students missed class, and farmers struggled to haul heavy cocoa bags through clay slopes. Today, the story is different.
“I’m very happy with the EU-STREIT Programme for coming into my area in Bumbita,” says local farmer and father of six, Ricky Raikos Kamba. “Now, vehicles pick us up straight at our doorsteps with our cocoa, coffee and other garden produce.”
The impact is widespread. Where only a few vehicles once dared to travel, up to 20 now make daily trips — many owned by locals. Transport costs have dropped by more than half, making it easier for farmers to send cocoa and coffee to market and return with essential goods. “Before, we used to walk two hours to the main road,” says Ricky. “Now it’s just 30 to 40 minutes by PMV.”
For women like Celina Benny, the change has brought peace of mind. “When the road condition was bad, it was very hard for us mothers,” she recalls. “Now, we can call for transport assistance, or vehicles in the village can assist us easily to the health centre.”
Students and teachers are also benefiting. At Urita Primary School, teacher Kuti Wambuan says materials and supplies now arrive directly at the campus, and attendance has improved. “Students walk easily to the school,” he says.
Beyond transport, the road has enabled families to buy and deliver water tanks, access health care faster, and boost local trade. As part of the broader EU-STREIT PNG Programme, the project complements ongoing efforts to strengthen the cocoa, vanilla, and fisheries value chains, creating lasting economic and social transformation.
Ricky sums it up best: “Before, we waited for PMVs on the main road. Now, they stop at our doorstep. The road has brought life closer to us.”"
Rare Conjoined Twins Born in Finschhafen,12/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6405,"In a rare medical event for Papua New Guinea, conjoined twin boys were born at the small, remote Braun Hospital in Finschhafen two days ago.
The hospital's staff, despite having few resources, managed to keep the newborn boys stable. Soon after, a special medical flight team from Manolos Aviation quickly flew the babies to Lae for better medical attention.
The twins are joined at the lower part of their bodies and share some internal organs. However, they have separate arms, legs, and genitals.
The mother, Fatima Kevin from Finschhafen, said that doctors knew she was carrying two babies because they detected two heartbeats during her pregnancy.
However, the rare condition of the twins being joined was only found during the birth.
Braun Hospital is run by the Lutheran Church and is well-known for struggling with money, but it continues to serve the local rural community.
The mother and her babies are now at Angau Memorial Hospital in Lae, where they are receiving specialised care.
Hospital staff said that after more tests, the twins might be sent overseas for operation to separate them.
Conjoined twins are uncommon in Papua New Guinea, with only a small number of cases reported over the last few decades."

PNGEA Strategy Launched,11/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6393,"The Papua New Guinea Environment Alliance (PNGEA) has officially launched its Strategy 2025–2027, signed a landmark Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Expertise France, and hosted a pivotal Civil Society Dialogue in preparation for COP30 in Brazil.
The two-day event from October 8-9, held during EU Green Diplomacy Week 2025, marks a major milestone for environmental civil society in PNG. Backed by the European Union-funded Forestry-Climate Change-Biodiversity (EU-FCCB) Programme, the Strategy sets out five ambitious goals to elevate environmental advocacy and action:
•	Sharing leading practices on sustainable development.
•	Influencing policy and governance at national and international levels.
•	Professionalising PNG’s environmental workforce.
•	Strengthening member institutions.
•	Building robust systems, partnerships, and digital platforms.
PNGEA, a coalition of 12 environmental NGOs and CSOs, aims to amplify the voice of Papua New Guinean communities in climate negotiations. The Strategy builds on its founding work since 2019 and positions civil society as a key player in shaping climate and biodiversity policy.
The MoU signed with Expertise France will provide PNGEA with strategic support in communications, IT, digitalisation, and organisational development—critical areas for implementing the new Strategy and ensuring long-term sustainability.
“This Strategy positions PNGEA and civil society organisations as critical partners in advancing inclusive climate action. Today’s Dialogue ensures that the voices of PNG’s communities are heard on the global stage at COP30,” said Pamela Avusi, PNGEA Coordinator.
Alaric Vandenberghe, Project Manager of the EU-FCCB Programme, added, “Strong partnerships between civil society, government, and development partners can deliver meaningful climate action. Ensuring that local communities and indigenous peoples are part of the conversation is essential to building resilience and driving real impact.”
The Civil Society Dialogue focused on three key advocacy areas for COP30:
•	Climate finance: Access and transparency for frontline communities.
•	Community and indigenous rights: Protection of land, culture, and traditional knowledge.
•	Local adaptation strategies: Scaling community-led resilience and innovation.
The outcomes will shape PNGEA’s advocacy agenda for COP30 and beyond, ensuring that Papua New Guinea’s environmental priorities are represented in global climate policy."

The annual SEOC rotates between regions, and next year the Islands Region will host the conference, with Bougainville officially taking up the baton.
The official handover ceremony took place on Friday, September 26, where the SEOC baton was symbolically passed to Bougainville in a vibrant cultural display led by representatives of the New Guinea Islands Region.

PNGUoT celebrates new dining hall,10/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6388,"The Papua New Guinea University of Technology in Lae today officially opened its new state-of-the-art dining hall, valued at approximately K30 million.
The construction of the dining hall, which started in April 2021, came to a halt following in-house issues with the initial contractor. The university stepped in and salvaged the situation, with vice chancellor, Professor Ora Renagi, describing their journey as one of “perseverance, unity and triumph”.
The National Executive Council allocated K20 million under its Public Investment Program to begin the construction of a new dining hall for PNGUoT.
Out of the six companies that had bid for the project, the NEC awarded the contract to Regional Engineering and Construction Ltd based on monetary and capability criteria, following points awarded by the National Procurement Commission and PNGUoT senior management.
Construction started in April 2021 but soon came to a halt in 2022 due to financial incapabilities.
“It has been a long journey; one filled with delays, obstacles and court challenges but it is also a journey of perseverance, unity and triumph,” said an emotional vice chancellor, Professor Ora Renagi.
“What we are witnessing today isn’t just the opening of a building; it is the fulfilment of a long-awaited dream – a symbol of resilience for the entire Unitech community.”
In 2022, the university was forced to terminate the contract with REC, and allocated an additional K10 million to rescope and complete the project.
Prof Renagi commended the university council for consulting independent experts to determine additional costs needed, as well as the project office for ensuring that construction was as per schedule.
The completed infrastructure can cater to 2,000 people, and is being used by students and the institution for big events, such as the 6th Pacific Islands Universities Regional Network conference that was hosted in July this year.
The well-ventilated, spacious dining facility replaces the one that was burnt down by students during a violent protest in June 26, 2016."
Supreme Court dismisses Niningi application on Connect PNG,10/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6386,"The seven-men bench of the Supreme Court has dismissed an application filed by Minister for Justice Pila Niningi seeking to dismiss the special reference application filed by Opposition Leader Douglas Tomuriesa challenging the legality of the Connect PNG programme funds.
Justice George Manuhu, Justice David Cannings, Justice Derek Hartshorn, Justice Joseph Yagi, Justice Collin Makail, Justice Ere Kariko, and Justice Peter Toliken dismissed the application for being an abuse of process.
On October 28 2024, the Leader of the Opposition was by consent declared to have standing to pursue the special reference application under section 18(1) of the Constitution. The first intervener, Minister for Justice Pila Niningi, then moved his objection to the competency of the Application, which was dismissed as incompetent for not being filed within the time limit prescribed by the Supreme Court Rules.
Niningi then filed another dismissal application on November 5 2024, principally under section 13 rule 16 of the Supreme Court Rules, seeking to summarily dismiss the application as being an abuse of process as it does not raise questions of interpretation or application of a constitutional law as required under section 18(1).
However, the court found that the grounds upon which the Attorney General seeks summary dismissal are matters concerning the merits of the Application, it may be argued at the substantive hearing of the Application, and that the Dismissal Application itself constitutes an abuse of process.
The substantive hearing of the Opposition Leader’s application will be heard at a later date.
Tomuriesa filed the application on June 4 2024, pursuant to section 18 of the Constitution, questioning the legality of the government's Connect PNG Programme. Among clarifications sought is the payment of nearly K2 billion for the road programme for April 2021 to January this year.
The main issue raised in the reference was the payments made by the Department of Works and National Highways to certain service providers for the funding and implementation of the Connect PNG Programme, which were not made in accordance with the mandatory statutory basis for the implementation and funding of the connect PNG programme."
Former Telikom staff want full entitlement,10/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6381,"Over 200 long-serving employees of Telikom PNG were retired and retrenched as part of the company’s restructure exercise.
The affected former staff have demanded an explanation of how entitlements were processed because they believe they have been unfairly compensated.
They demanded that management firstly explain the removal of long-serving staff, most of whom are still below the retirement age of 65.
Former employee Yowane Kewanu said, “The CEO made this announcement on September 12th during our pre-independence celebrations. He mentioned that there will be only 100 or fewer people at the age of 55 and above, but those willing to go may do so.  After a few weeks, they gave us notice to leave, under what terms and conditions, we did not know,” Kewanu said.
Another employee, Mary Wak said she and her colleagues were handed retirement and retrenchment letters to sign on September 26, 2025. She claims there was no consultation with management, no dialogue with Human Resource and no prior notice.
“There was no consultation with us, no HR consultation telling us that we are going, and we have to prepare for it,” she said.
Wak said many long-serving employees with 30 to 45 years of service were paid between K2,000 and K50,000 in leave entitlements.
“They gave us rec leave and fellow leave only, some got K40,000 some got K20,000, K5,000 some got K3,000, and that was a nightmare for many of us,” she said.
After signing their letters, the aggrieved former staff submitted a petition to Telikom PNG management, giving it 48 hours to explain the process used in paying the entitlements.
The petition expired on Wednesday, October 8, 2025, with no response from the Telikom management, prompting them to raise their grievances through the media in a quest to seek answers.
Telikom CEO Amos Tepi in a media release stated 	that the merger of Telikom and bemobile has led to a restructure, resulting in the retirement and retrenchment of staff and is part of the second Phase of this transition process.
Tepi stated that the retrenchment exercise was approved under NEC Decision No. 38 of 2019. The statement also claims that each affected employee had a one-on-one meeting with Human Resource prior, and that management conducted town hall meetings with staff over the past three years about the restructure program - the most recent being September 12, 2025. The second phase of that exercise was implemented 14 days later."
Late Wenge’s body returns home for burial,09/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6375,"The body of late Morobe Governor, Luther Akisawa Wenge was formally returned to his family and people in Baindoang today, where he will be laid to rest among his ancestors.
Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso, acting as the nation's chief mourner, officially handed over the casket to Mr. Wenge's tribesmen. The handover was witnessed by family members, political colleagues, and citizens from across Morobe Province.
Luther Wenge was widely known for his deep commitment to both faith and justice. He was raised in a missionary family - his father helped spread the Lutheran faith throughout Morobe, a background that greatly influenced his strong character and leadership.
His journey into public service began early. He showed leadership as a school captain at Dregerhafen High School and went on to study law at the University of Papua New Guinea. Before entering politics, he achieved a distinguished legal career, serving as a respected National Court judge.
As Governor, Mr. Wenge earned a reputation as a bold and visionary politician. He was a staunch defender of Papua New Guinea's Constitution, often challenging decisions he felt were unfair or went against the interests of ordinary citizens.
His Lutheran faith was the cornerstone of his governance, promoting a philosophy focused on service, compassion, and equality for all people under the law. Drawing on his own rural roots, he championed better services for remote areas, prioritizing universal education, rural health, and fair development across the nation.
In a final tribute, DPM Rosso thanked the people of Nabak and Nawaeb for sharing Mr. Wenge’s leadership with the rest of Papua New Guinea. He described the late Governor as a ""giant"" of Morobe politics whose legacy will continue to inspire the nation."

The agreement contains new and improved terms, reinforcing Ok Tedi’s commitment to the communities there.
The 4th CMCA delivers the largest increase in benefits in the agreement’s history – up to 80 percent increase across the board, with some regions having more than 100 percent increases on their current CMCA compensation package. These benefits are not only larger in scale but broader in scope.
The 4th CMCA introduces three new components:
• Youth Development Programs to empower future generations.
• Short-Term Investment Opportunities to promote economic sustainability.
• Impact Projects Agreement to address the social development gaps.
“These additions reflect our belief that the future of our communities lies not only in mining, but in education, entrepreneurship, and resilience,” said Ok Tedi Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Kedi Ilimbit, when speaking at the ceremony on Tuesday 7th October.
Mr Ilimbit acknowledged the presence of Prime Minister Hon. James Marape, State Owned Enterprise Minister William Duma, Mining Minister Rainbo Paita, Minister for Livestock and Member for South Fly Seki Agisa, Deputy Opposition Leader and Member for North Fly James Donald, Western Provincial Governor Taboi Awi Yoto, Member for Delta Fly Agena Gamai and members of the Fly River Provincial Government administration.
Also in attendance were the landowner leaders, and community representatives, statutory agencies and government departments; all of whom were involved in celebrating this momentous achievement built on over a year of inclusive dialogue and negotiation.
The signing ceremony was witnessed by the Board and Management of Kumul Minerals Holdings, the Mineral Resources Development Company Management, Mineral Resources Authority Managing Director Jerry Garry, PNG Sustainable Development Program Limited management, Department of Mineral Policy and Geohazards Secretary Harry Kore and his team, and National Energy Authority Managing Director Ronald Maketa.
“This agreement is the result of a rigorous dialogue process grounded in Free, Prior and Informed Consent,” said Mr Ilimbit. “Every village had the opportunity to engage, ask questions, and make informed decisions with the support of independent legal advisors. It has been a long journey, lasting 19 months but one that reflects our shared values of transparency and respect.”
Speaking at the signing ceremony, mine villages and CMCA leaders, women and youth representatives also commended Ok Tedi for the improvements to the CMCA benefits package and the willingness to work with them to achieve an outcome favourable to all parties.
Since the inception of CMCA in 2001, the Agreement has ensured that the 152 CMCA villages and six mine villages have a direct voice and stake in the mine’s operations. Today, these communities are not only beneficiaries but shareholders, owning 21 percent of shares in Ok Tedi through Mineral Resources CMCA Holdings and Minerals Resources Star Mountain. The remaining 12% of the 33% total shareholding by Western Province is held by the Fly River Provincial Government.
“As we honour PNG’s 50th Independence Anniversary, Ok Tedi remains proud as a pillar of nation-building. We are not just a mining company – we are a company owned by Papua New Guineans, serving Papua New Guineans, and building Papua New Guinea,” said Mr Ilimbit. “Our legacy is measured not just in ounces of gold or tonnes of copper, but in the schools, health posts, infrastructure, and and sustainable livelihoods that will remain long after the mine closes.”
Mr Ilimbit concluded: “To our landowners: thank you for your trust, patience, and partnership. Ok Tedi belongs to all of us, and together, we will continue to make it a source of pride for Papua New Guinea.”"
Police printing office opened,08/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6362,"The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary opened its Material Printing Unit Office at Bomana Police College yesterday in the nation's capital.
The printing infrastructure was constructed by the Far East Handyman company and completed within a period of three months.
Deputy Commissioner of Police Administration, Dr. Philip Mitna, said RPNGC has been working hard to upgrade its existing infrastructure.

Assistant Commissioner of Police Training, Silva Sika, also thanked the RPNGC management for the initiative taken to renovate the building and said the building will not only serve the force but will also be of great help to the Police College in terms of printing their teaching materials."
Mining wealth not reaching people: Marape,08/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6361,"Prime Minister James Marape has expressed his pride in the people of Western Province but acknowledged the poor human development indicators despite the Ok Tedi mine's operations.
Speaking at the closing ceremony of the CMCA workshop in Port Moresby last night, the Prime Minister challenged stakeholders to assess the sustainability of wealth transfer since the 2001 social license was granted.
He revealed that as Finance Minister in 2012, he had refused attempts to change the trust structure for CMCA funds, which then stood at almost K700 million.
""The government is committed to saving for the next generation,"" the Prime Minister stressed, citing an example where the National Government is currently holding or transferring over K300 million to partners for projects designed to create ""intergenerational wealth that stays forever.""
Meantime, the Prime Minister confirmed a significant increase in the benefits package, which he urged Ok Tedi Mining Limited (OTML) and Kumul Minerals Holdings Limited (KMHL) to formalise.
Key details of the forthcoming agreement include:
•	Increased Equity Rates: The MoA to be taken to Cabinet next week will include ""increased equity rates"" for the CMCA people.
•	Tax Credit Scheme Boost: The current 2% rate going to the Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme (TCS) will be increased to 3%.
Marape insisted that the 12th CMCA must be a ""transformational"" agreement, not just a contractual one.
He noted that with an estimated population of only 300,000 people, the proper planning of this single mine's proceeds could lead to the complete betterment of Western Province.
He concluded by assuring the people that the final agreement will be one that ""respects the people, improves lives, and aligns with national policy to ensure Western Province is developed better for all."""
Integrating Senisim Pasin program into policy,08/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6360,"Senisim Pasin Program will be integrated into the education department’s revised Behavioural Management Policy 2019, now under review by education services.
NCD Senior School Inspector Christoper Goiobu said the behavioural management policy launched in 2021 is being reviewed by NCD Education Services in partnership with PNG Tribal Foundation through a trainer's training workshop.
The training is focused on preparing for the National In-Service Training, scheduled for next year, which will introduce the revised Behavioural Management Policy into schools across NCD.
“The purpose of the workshop is to bring together school inspectors, guidance officers, and training officers from NCD Education Service to compile a comprehensive training package, including a training book, a facilitator’s manual, and a participants’ workbook.
“Our partnership will equip teachers with effective strategies to manage student behaviour in schools, while also embedding values and approaches led by the Senisim PNG program,” he said.
The Education Department partnered with PNG Tribal Foundation on the leadership program called Senisim PNG this year, which teaches good values and servant leadership from the Maxwell Foundation’s book.
Two schools, including Jubilee Catholic Secondary and Marianville Secondary, completed an 11-week transformation table, graduated and are certified facilitators.
Other schools, including Del La Salle Secondary, Waigani Christian College, Ororo Junior High, Bavaroko Junior High, and Tokarara Junior High School, have started on the transformation table.
Tribal Foundation President GT Bustin said Senisim PNG program is more than awareness; it is about transformation.
“We want to inspire individuals to shift their mindset, embrace leadership, and take action for the betterment of their communities,” Bustin said.
Senisim PNG National Coordinator Phillie Marai said there are four other programs under Tribal Foundation that is still under development and will be rolled out to schools targeting primary schools, elementary, and early childhood learning in the future."
From Battlefield to Bonding,08/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6359,"What was once a battleground has become a bridge - in October 2023, the newly inaugurated Nadzab Tomodachi International Airport opened near Lae, redefining ties between Papua New Guinea and Japan. The airport’s name, “Tomodachi” meaning “friend” in Japanese  is a deliberate tribute to reconciliation, peace, and shared progress.
The project was supported by Japan through its Official Development Assistance (ODA) mechanism and executed via the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The program included a new passenger terminal, runway and taxiway upgrades, and renovations of control and fire towers.
Prime Minister James Marape, speaking at the 50th anniversary of Japan’s ODA to PNG in October 2024, called Japan a “sincere and genuine friend,” recognizing decades of development collaboration. The airport’s naming was his suggestion, intended to anchor the relationship in symbolism as much as infrastructure.

The site of Nadzab is itself steeped in history. In 1943, during World War II, fierce battles raged there; over 150,000 Japanese soldiers perished in what became known to Japan as the “Place of No Return.” Allied forces captured the area in an airborne operation, turning it into a strategic base known as NADZAB (Northern Australian Defence Zone Air Base).
Today, Nadzab stands as a potent symbol of reconciliation. The airport is strategically important — it fosters trade, tourism, emergency logistics, and deepens bilateral trust. Japan has similarly backed upgrades at Jacksons International Airport in Port Moresby and Tokua Airport in East New Britain, strengthening PNG’s overall aviation infrastructure.
PNG is a critical partner for Japan in resource supply. It ranks among Japan’s top import sources within the Pacific, providing LNG, crude oil, minerals, timber, and agricultural products. Japanese investments and trade interest depend in part on reliable infrastructure and logistics.

The friendship has proven responsive beyond economics. Following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, PNGers and the government raised 10 million kina in aid for Japan — a remarkable showing given the socioeconomic challenges many PNG households face.
PNG has achieved major milestones — its 50th anniversary of independence and 50 years of diplomatic relations with Japan in 2025 — the two nations find themselves looking ahead together. The Nadzab Tomodachi Airport is not just a transport hub, but a living monument to what bonds—once forged in conflict—can become."
CLRC officers challenged to drive change,08/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6356,"The Secretary of the Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC), Dr. Mange Matui has challenged three senior officers, who have recently achieved significant academic milestones, to utilize their skills in the interest of the Commission and the country as a whole.
Secretary Matui made this statement during a congratulatory luncheon program to honour Principal Legal Officer Biteng Narewec for obtaining his Master of Laws in Constitutional and Administrative Law from Parul University in India; Manager Administration, Bill Katu for completing his Bachelor of Business Management at the University of Papua New Guinea, and Executive Assistant to Deputy Secretary for Legislative Reform, Winnie Haroro for attaining her Diploma in Business Management from the Somare Institute of Leadership and Governance.
These milestone achievements reflect CLRC’s commitment to fostering professional growth and ensuring its officers are equipped with the right knowledge and skills to strengthen the Commission’s core mandate in law review and reform.
Dr. Matui reminded the officers of their obligation to the Commission, “You are morally obliged to serve this institution, because we see the potential in you, we see that you can contribute to CLRC in the long run, that’s why we invested in you,” he said.
He added, “The future of the organization depends on qualified people, and young people to come onboard and drive this organization going forward, that’s why it is imperative we invest in this area.”
He further challenged the officers to translate their knowledge into innovative change that will benefit the Commission and contribute to the development of the nation. “I encourage each of you to use your academic achievements as tools to influence meaningful change and help chart the nation’s course into the next fifty years.”
“On behalf of CLRC, the Management and every one of us, we would like to sincerely congratulate you on these achievements; these are achievements for CLRC and personal achievements for each of you as well,”, said Dr. Matui.
The three officers were given the opportunity to share their experiences and challenges endured, all sharing similar sentiments on the importance of dedication and commitment.
The luncheon celebration also served as an inspiration for other officers of the CLRC, highlighting the Commission’s culture of continuous learning and excellence. It reinforced the principle that capacity building is central to sustaining CLRC’s role as the people’s voice in law reform.
Through its dedicated staff and strong institutional mandate, CLRC remains committed to its vision of reforming laws for a better and just Papua New Guinea."
PNG’s economic outlook remains positive: IMF,08/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6355,"PNG’s economic outlook remains positive with growth expected to increase to 4.5 percent in 2025 from an estimated 3.8 percent in 2024, supported by increased production of Porgera gold mine, continued improvement in access to foreign exchange (FX), and favorable agriculture production.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report, an average headline inflation is projected to rebound to 3.8 percent in 2025 from a historical low of 0.6 percent in 2024 as the drag from betel nut prices eases, while core inflation, which excludes selected volatile items, is projected to edge up to 3.3 percent in 2025, staying below the historical average.
IMF mission chief for Papua New Guinea, Nir Klein reaffirmed that the gross international reserves, which stood at US$3.6 billion (K15.11b) at end-July 2025 (equivalent to about five months of imports of goods and services), are expected to remain adequate and support the crawl-like exchange rate arrangement.
“The government remains committed to an ambitious fiscal consolidation strategy in line with its 13-year budget repair plan. Having reduced the fiscal deficit by 1.1 percentage point of GDP in 2024, the authorities are on track to deliver a reduction of at least 0.6 percentage point of GDP in 2025, through both revenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization,” Mr Klein said.
He said the authorities plan to further reduce the deficit in the upcoming 2026 budget, consistent with their objective of reaching a balanced budget in 2027 and are committed to implement a prudent borrowing strategy aimed at reducing public debt vulnerabilities.
The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) has continued to actively implement its roadmap of reforms to help alleviate FX shortages, gradually return to Kina convertibility, and modernize its monetary policy operations.
IMF reported that access to FX has improved significantly in 2025, supported by the implementation of the crawl-like arrangement, BPNG’s FX intervention strategy, and favorable commodity prices, which have contributed to buoyant export proceeds.
The Monetary Policy Committee’s decision to increase the Kina Facility Rate in September 2025 is a welcome step to ensure consistency with the exchange rate arrangement while the continued reduction of the Cash Reserve Requirement ratio will help ease liquidity conditions in the banking system.
According to the IMF, to improve monetary policy transmission and facilitate a more active interbank market, the BPNG continues to build up the critical operational and legal frameworks and enhance its liquidity management and emergency lending toolkit."

Understanding Reached to Complete Key Reviews,08/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6352,"The International Monetary Fund and the Government of Papua New Guinea have reached a staff-level agreement on policies needed to complete the fifth review of the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangements and the second review of the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) arrangement.
Upon approval by the IMF Executive Board, the completion of these reviews would allow for the immediate disbursement of SDR121.07 million (K694.52m) under the ECF-EFF arrangements and SDR39.48 million (K226.47m) in financing under the RSF arrangement.
This would bring the total IMF financial support disbursed thus far under these arrangements to SDR622.48 million (K3.57b).
“The IMF will continue to work closely with the authorities and stands ready to help them, not only through financing and policy advice, but also through capacity development, coordinated with other partners.
IMF mission chief for Papua New Guinea, Nir Klein said the IMF team is grateful to the authorities for their warm hospitality, productive collaboration, and open policy dialogue.
“Performance under the Fund-supported programs has been satisfactory. The authorities have also made steady progress in implementing their structural reform agenda and demonstrated strong commitment to program objectives.
“All, but one, quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets set for end-June 2025 were met, and most structural benchmarks due by end-September 2025 were implemented.
“Two RSF reform measures scheduled for this review are on track to be implemented in the coming weeks,” Mr Klein said.
“These reforms have yielded notable results thus far, including:
i)	a sharp reduction of the fiscal deficit, helping to alleviate public debt vulnerabilities,
ii)	improved access to FX and mopping of a significant part of excess liquidity,
iii)	establishment of an operational anti-corruption framework, and
iv)	easier access to data on natural disasters to support a climate-conscious decision-making.”
The IMF team met with Minister for Treasury Ian Ling-Stuckey, Governor of BPNG Elizabeth Genia, Secretary of Treasury Andrew Oaeke, Deputy Governor of BPNG, Jefferey Yabom, and other senior government officials.

"Pukpuk Treaty A PNG-Initiated Move, Not an Australian Imposition",08/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6349,"The signing of the Pukpuk Treaty on Monday fuelled debate, some saying PNG was lured to enter into this agreement by Australia when it granted PNG a team to play in NRL, while others pointing out implications of this treaty on PNG’s sovereignty as a nation.
Marape clarified that Australia never requested PNG to enter into this treaty – instead PNG reached out to Australia as part of its 50th reset agenda.
Prime Minister James Marape in a media conference on Monday evening, put these claims to rest, highlighting the need to rebuild and strengthen the capacity of PNG Defence Force.
“And I want to put it to Papua New Guinea right from the outset.
Australia never requested this. We were pretty content with living and working in the Defence Cooperation Agreement that we've had with them. We've had the security forces moving in and out, working in partnership with PNG Defence Force, the current naval base refit and restoration happening in Manus, etc.
But we reached out to them as part of our 50th reset, and especially from PNG's interest to resuscitate, rebuild, re-strengthen our Defence Force at the earliest,“ he explained
The Prime Minister further pointed out PNG’s inability to defend its shores in the event of an attack and how PNG can rely on treaties like this to access help.
“I want to inform Papua New Guinea, my people, right now as we speak, if someone chooses to invade, God forbid, and we have no enemies right now, and I qualify this, but on a hypothetical situation, if someone chooses to invade PNG right now, as your Prime Minister, or Minister Billy, as your Defence Minister, or your Defence Commander, has no ability whatsoever to defend our country on air, on sea, technology, or on land. Four areas, on air, sea, land, or through technology.
“My number one job as your Prime Minister is your security man. It's my responsibility to look at the security apparatus we have. Domestic security, internal security, external security, the threats that we pose within, and possibility of the defence of our sovereignty going forward.
“Today, our country, our 3 million square kilometres of sea borders, our 462,840 square kilometres of land space, the vulnerabilities, the exposures we have compels us, by a stroke of a pen, to have access to a world-class security capability and capacity.”
He further clarified that the signing of this treaty does not give Australia the right to tamper with PNG’s sovereignty. It can only act when asked to.
“What this one technically means in Papua New Guinea is expose some place. Then Australia's capacity is there for us to lean on. We've signed this agreement, but it doesn't give automatic Australia intervention in our country.”
Meantime, in consistent with Section 117 of the Constitution, the treaty will now be brought to parliament for ratification.
Ratification will signify the formal consent to be bound by the treaty's provisions."

Dr Billy welcomes Defence Treaty,07/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6346,"Minister for Defence, Dr Billy Joseph has commended the visionary leadership of Prime Minister James Marape for signing the Security (PukPuk) Treaty with Australia on Monday in Canberra, Australia.
Dr Billy in a statement described the Treaty as a landmark bilateral defence agreement designed to protect and strengthen Papua New Guinea’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity through mutual defence cooperation, modernisation of the PNG Defence Force (PNGDF), and significant socio-economic benefits for the people of Papua New Guinea.
“Prime Minister, I congratulate you on signing this critical mutual defence treaty today in Canberra. It is the correct, forward-thinking decision taken at exactly the right time,” said Dr. Billy.
Dr Billy emphasised that this treaty reflects maturity in bilateral relations and a shared vision for regional stability.
“We must not dwell in the past, especially on past decisions by either government. As we mark our 50th Independence Anniversary and look to construct the next 50 years, national security must be at the core of that construct. The PukPuk Treaty is the foundation of that outcome,” he said.
The Minister further reaffirmed that the treaty is fully compliant with the Constitution of Papua New Guinea and does not require any constitutional amendment for its implementation.
He further explained that under the treaty, PNG citizens recruited into the Australian Defence Force (ADF) will not be members of the PNGDF.
“They will hold dual citizenship and may attain Australian citizenship within nine weeks of recruitment.
“A similar opportunity will apply to Australian citizens wishing to serve in the PNGDF. While PNGDF and ADF personnel will train and operate together to improve interoperability, the Commander of the PNGDF retains full command and control of his forces within PNG’s jurisdiction.
“Likewise, the Commander of the ADF maintains authority over Australian troops,” the Minister clarified.
This, Dr Billy said will ensure that the mandate of the PNGDF under Section 202 remains fully protected."
New Forestry plantation extension program launched,07/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6341,"The PNG Forest Authority (PNGFA) has called on landowners throughout the country to partner with the authority and plant more trees under the government’s ‘Painim Graun - Planim Diwai’ (Find Land - Plant trees) program.
PNGFA managing director John Mosoro made the call when addressing foresters, landowners, and the community during the launch of the Bulolo-Wau New Forestry Plantation Extension Program on Thursday, October 1. The launch concluded PNGFA’s 50th independence anniversary celebrations.
According to PNGFA, a total of 12,500 hectares of trees have been planted and sustained at the Bulolo Wau Forestry plantations. These trees at the plantations are then harvested by PNG Forest Products to process and produce plywood, sawn timber, and veneer products.
Mosoro said a target of 800,000 hectares of land is needed to plant trees and commended landowners of Bulolo and Watut for agreeing to participate in the government forestry reforestation program.
He said the program will be a win-win solution for all forest stakeholders.
“It will promote tree planting and reforestation, and carbon trade, as PNG forests are globally known to be the last tracts of pristine rainforests in the world and the lungs of Mother Earth,” added Mosoro.
He appealed to landowners to participate in the program, which will provide them with greater benefits through equity participation.
Meantime, PNGFA and the Bulolo landowners will soon sign an agreement for the landowners to take up equity shares in the project, which will be operated by PNGFA's business arm - PNG Diwai Holdings Limited.
Mosoro stressed that the forestry sector is an important sector that is renewable and sustainable and will sustain itself in the future, unlike oil, gas, and gold resources, which will be gone.
“That is why forestry is a God given value to us. We are managing forests that God has created to sustain our lives on earth. Forests are the lungs of the earth. If we make the wrong policies, we will end up destroying our planet,” Mosoro said.
Member for Bulolo Sam Basil Jnr was also a guest speaker at the launch. He commended PNGFA for its support of the Bulolo community and town.
“We call this a town because of you, PNGFA. Let me represent my people and acknowledge the work of the government under this plantation program and associated activities.
“Forestry has created employment and income for our people. Although we do have social and land issues and would like to call for a review of the initial agreement,” MP Basil said.
PNGFA has agreed to review the Bulolo plantation agreement."

“The EU’s long-standing support has enabled CCDA and the government and our partner agencies to turn policies into real practical actions, empowering our provincial government, our civil society, and the communities to really take ownership of climate’s options that aligned with PNGs nationally determined contribution and our long-term initial strategies. This green diplomacy week reminds us that diplomacy is not only a government-to-government dialogue, but it is really about our shared action and it is also inspiring to see our youths, young leaders, our entrepreneurs and our scientists as well coming together to contribute to just, inclusive and climate resilient and I would like to go back to last week when we had our Climate Change Summit. It was an interesting platform where we have actually seen young people from primary level coming in very innovative minds in terms of identifying climate problems and what their solutions are,” Sungi said.
Alaric Vandenberghe, Project Manager of the EU-FCCB Programme, National Component under the Expertise France Group, explained the purpose of the programme.
“We have different interventions but one of the ones we are extremely happy to roll out is the Masters Scholarship Scheme and so this is part of our support to post-graduate towards education and research. And so we are offering 20 scholarships in the FCCB space this year,” said Vandenberghe.
The programme is now calling for another 20 applicants for the Masters Scholarships, as there are currently not many people with postgraduate qualifications in this discipline. The scholarships are fully funded, valued at K10 million, and support both research and education."
A modern horror story,06/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6334,"With both legs tied to a cut tree branch, a woman’s lifeless body was hoisted as a pig as young men carried her and placed her next to a fire.
Men, women and children were watching this incident and taking videos at a settlement called ‘As Mambu’ at Backroad, in Lae, Morobe Province.
With a visible cut to the right side of her head, and blood coating her face, this woman was one of three who were accused of practicing “sanguma”, or sorcery, and were tortured on Wednesday, October 1, 2025.
She was placed next to a seated elderly woman whose hair and body were covered in soot and soil. Her hands were tied behind her back, her stretched legs were also tied together in front of her while her bowed head showed no signs of consciousness.
A third woman, bearing the same bloody and dishevelled appearance as the other two but with a torn blouse and still conscious, was brutally kicked by a man who was armed with two bush knives as a voice in the background yelled: “Burn them in the fire!”
The man taking the video could be heard clearly narrating that “The community has not developed because of these women”.
“As you all can see, this is Backroad, Lae city, where these sanguma are doing their dirty deeds and now men have apprehended them and are killing them,” he said.
Lae metropolitan superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, said this barbaric act has claimed the lives of two women while another is at the ANGAU Memorial Provincial Hospital.
One of the victims was from Simbu while the other two are from Menyamya.
“Five suspects were apprehended, including the person taking the video,” said chief superintendent Kunyanban.
“Because we were so busy on Friday – the entire police were engaged in the arrival of the late governor’s casket on Friday – straight after that, we prioritised their arrest on Saturday, October 4th.
“The first suspect apprehended was the one who took the video, while the other four followed after.”
The Lae head of police relented that while PNG’s culture is deeply-rooted in traditional practices and beliefs that include sorcery, laws need to be established to specifically deal with what he described as “two sides to a coin”.
“But what they have done is totally wrong; they cannot take the law into their own hands.”
While some social media users believed that the person who took the video should be treated as a “whistleblower”, Kunyanban said: “If he was serious about the offence, he should’ve told the police about it. Why put it on Facebook? Is that the police station?”
Investigation is continuing into the incident, with more arrests expected.
Those implicated are expected to be charged with two counts of wilful murder each, and attempted murder on the life of the third survivor.
Kunyanban said this is the first reported case of sorcery-accusation related violence (SARV) from As Mambu."

Sentencing conference opens,06/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6332,"Over 76 magistrates from Papua New Guinea are in attendance for a three-day National Sentencing Parity Conference in Port Moresby.
The conference, opened today by Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika,  aims to identify issues with making sentences, especially in criminal matters. It is driven by a dire need to find impartiality and balance in the sentencing space.
Chief Magistrate Mark Pupaka said magistrates, including judges, are judicial officers bound by an oath to respect the constitution and to implement justice without fear or favor when making sentences prescribed by the law.
“As we find imparity in the sentencing space, we also need to visibly demonstrate to our stakeholders, the country, and our people that we respect the rule of law in the context as judicial officers sitting on the district court bench and responsible leaders able to create deterrence in each matter neither civil or criminal that comes before us on a daily basis,” he said.
Pupaka said stability and safety in the sentencing space have been lacking for years. Hence, the conference will create pathways on how magistrates can manage this issue.
Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika said imposing a sentence based on the law is not easy due to humanitarian grounds, but legal practitioners must not use this as an excuse.
“Many people think it is easy to sentence a person, hearing the evidence and acting on that evidence is okay, but to give a sentence is a difficult job,” he said.
He urged magistrates to highlight the issues of sentencing in their respective courtrooms and learn from each other on how best they can improve the sentencing space of the law and justice sector.
Sir Gibbs warned magistrates not to misuse their power as guardians of the law when convicting and imposing sentences.
“We are powerful people, but our power must be used with responsibility; don’t abuse the power of sentencing. The power we have is also subject to appeals in the National or Supreme Court,” he said."
"17 houses burnt, communities flee",06/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6331,"Seventeen houses at Horse Camp in Moresby South were burnt to ashes three weeks ago, after an Engan man was murdered by a man from Gulf.
The Commander of the National Capital District and Central, Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police, Benjamin Turi, led a team of police units who visited Horse Camp in Moresby South this morning after learning that almost all the people from Gulf who reside there had left in fear after their houses were burned by alleged Engan men.
Commander Turi and his officers, while at the scene, confirmed that about seventeen houses were burned to ashes three weeks ago after an Engan man was murdered by a man from Gulf.
Commander Turi said the murder suspect had been arrested and is now in police custody. He stated that the Engans do not have any right to burn the houses and set up a mourning house in a public area that other innocent Gulf people have access to.
He said the funny thing he learned while visiting the area was that the Engans chased the Gulf people out of their houses, and then they got power from one of the houses and connected it to their mourning house that they are hosting at Sabama.
""This is Port Moresby City, and we do not want to see people bringing their village mentality to the city. Burning down houses and then trying to claim the land is not right and is unlawful. We will investigate the matter and have those who burned down the houses arrested and charged, just like we did to the person who murdered the Engan man.
“I am calling on the Engans who are supporting their tribesmen to set up the mourning house and demand K200,000 compensation to stop. We have names of people who are doing that. They will be arrested and charged soon,"" Commander Turi said.
He said the owners of the houses that were burnt down by the Engans and those who fled Horse Camp must work closely with Badili Police and provide statements so they can fast-track the case. He stated that the police will patrol that area to ensure that those who left their houses return and that those who are not residents there must not go there and create new problems.
Commander Turi, who was with police officers from Badili and other police units, visited the arson sites and advised the victims to work with the police."
No students must be left out: Education Secretary,06/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6330,"The Department of Education is aware of an incident involving twenty-seven (27) Grade 10 students from Kimbe Grammar School in West New Britain Province who were unable to sit for their first day of the National Examinations due to non-payment of school fees.
Secretary for Education, Dr Uke Kombra, said the Department is being informed of the situation and is working closely with the West New Britain Provincial Education Office and the school to ensure the affected students are given the opportunity to complete their examinations.
“We have been advised by the Provincial Education Advisor that a formal letter will be issued to the school to allow the students to sit for their examinations starting tomorrow, Tuesday, October 7, 2025.
They will also be required to complete a Notice of Absenteeism form to account for the paper they missed today,” Dr. Kombra said.
He explained that Kimbe Grammar School is a private institution and operates under its own administrative and financial policies, separate from government-run schools.
“Private schools manage their own affairs, including staff salaries and fee structures. Students who enroll in private institutions do so under the terms and conditions set by the school,” Dr. Kombra stated.
Despite this, Dr Kombra emphasized that no child should be denied the right to education or participation in national assessments due to circumstances beyond their control.
“Education is a right for every child in Papua New Guinea, whether in the public or private system.
While private schools have their own governance structures, we continue to advocate for inclusive and fair practices that prioritize the welfare and learning continuity of all students,” he said.
Dr Kombra further appealed to school administrations, parents, and provincial authorities to collaborate and resolve such matters amicably to avoid disruption to students’ learning and examinations.
“We want every eligible student to complete their education successfully.
The Department will continue to monitor the situation and ensure that the affected students are given a fair chance to complete their exams,” Dr Kombra said."
IRC directed to review mining companies’ taxes,06/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6328,"Prime Minister James Marape has directed the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) to conduct a comprehensive review of all mining companies operating in Papua New Guinea to ensure they are paying their fair share of taxes amid record global commodity prices.
This follows the announcement by New Porgera Limited that it has paid over K500 million in corporate tax for the first two quarters of 2025 - a milestone he described as commendable and exemplary.
“If Porgera, operating in a very remote and challenging environment, can pay over K500 million in tax within just six months, it raises a legitimate question - are all our other mining companies paying their fair share?” Marape said.
“In this day and age where gold, copper, nickel, iron, and silver prices are at their highest, Papua New Guinea expects proportional returns from the resource companies operating here.”
The Prime Minister has tasked the IRC to immediately review the taxation compliance of all mining operations, comparing production levels, operational costs, and taxes paid, and to provide a detailed report to the National Government.
“I am asking the IRC Commissioner to check the books and give me a report on all mining companies - who is paying what, and whether those payments reflect current high commodity prices,” he said.
“Those companies that are paying their fair share, I say thank you. But we must ensure that everyone contributes equitably to our nation’s revenue base.”
The Prime Minister emphasised that ensuring tax compliance across the sector is crucial to PNG’s broader economic reform goals.
“I have made it no secret that once our economy reaches the K200 billion threshold, my government will review and consider cutting taxes for our people and businesses,” he said.
“But to get there, everyone - especially large corporations - must carry their fair share of the national burden.”
He noted that while some existing resource development agreements date back to the late 1990s and early 2000s, it was important that these arrangements evolve with global market realities.
“Many of these agreements were signed decades ago under very different economic conditions. With today’s high resource prices, tax contributions must reflect that reality,” he said.
“We respect existing agreements, but fairness and transparency demand that both the State and the companies work together to ensure Papua New Guinea receives equitable benefit from its resources.”
Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed his government’s commitment to strengthening fiscal oversight, increasing domestic revenue collection, and ensuring the mining and petroleum sectors contribute effectively to national development."
PNG supports Australia’s bid for COP31,06/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6321,"Papua New Guinea is backing Australia’s bid to host the 31st Conference of the Parties (COP31) in Adelaide, Australia, next year.
Minister for Environment, Conservation and Climate Change, Simo Kilepa, affirmed PNG’s commitment to stand with Australia during the recent Pacific Climate Change Ministers Meeting, in Sydney, held from October 2–3.
He said PNG was pleased to participate in the Pacific Climate Change Ministers Meeting to reaffirm the Pacific solidarity and the strength of their collective voice as frontline nations of the climate crisis.
Minister Kilepa stated that the Pacific continues to face the harsh realities of climate change, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and the loss of ecosystems and livelihoods.
“In response, we are united in calling for urgent and ambitious global action. At this meeting, Pacific Island countries unanimously agreed to support Australia’s bid to host the COP31. in partnership with the Pacific, this bid, currently contested between Australia and Turkey, represents a crucial opportunity for the world to come to the Pacific and witness firsthand the realities of the climate emergency,” said Minister Kilepa.
He recalls the strong statement of support delivered by Prime Minister James Marape during the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
In his address, Prime Minister Marape highlighted PNG’s support for Australia’s COP31 candidacy, recognizing it as a Pacific COP that will amplify the voices and priorities of Small Island Developing States.
“We commend Australia for its inclusive approach in advancing this bid on behalf of the Pacific, and we acknowledge the unity of all Pacific countries in standing together on this matter of shared importance.
“Papua New Guinea remains fully committed to contributing to the success of COP31 and to advancing the goals of the Paris Agreement through strengthened NDCs, REDD+ implementation, and effective participation in Article 6 carbon markets,” Kilepa said.
“Today, the Pacific speaks with one voice: we support Australia’s bid for COP31. We look forward to welcoming the world to our region to witness the urgency of the climate challenge, and to inspire stronger global action for the survival of our islands and the future of our children.”
Australia and Türkiye have been locked in a long-running stand-off over the right to host the COP31 summit in 2026.
The huge event is expected to draw more than 20,000 delegates.
It is due to be hosted by a member of the UN regional group ""Western Europe and Others States"", which comprises 28 countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany."
"Late Wenge was a great leader, says PM",05/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6320,"Prime Minister James Marape has described the late Morobe Governor Luther Wenge as a “great statesman of Papua New Guinea,” saying his life of service in law, justice, and politics will inspire future generations.
Speaking at the handover of Governor Wenge’s body in Lae on Friday, Prime Minister Marape said Wenge’s deep commitment to the people, both as a legislator and public servant, stood as a shining example for the country.
“His contribution to Papua New Guinea, whether in the law and justice sector or in political life, stands tall,” PM Marape said. “If the people’s love for a leader does not motivate us to do the right thing for our country, then we are in the wrong place doing the wrong thing for Papua New Guinea.”
The Prime Minister thanked the people of Morobe for their support, saying their confidence gave him hope. He also highlighted four major initiatives that Governor Wenge strongly advocated for in partnership with the National Government:
1. Hidden Valley Mine – Renewal of the mining lease to sustain operations and benefits, which Wenge fought to secure.
2. Wafi-Golpu Project – Progress on a new and fairer benefit-sharing agreement is expected to deliver substantial revenues to the State, Morobe, and landowners.
3. Nadzab Redevelopment – Relocation of Tutumang and the development of Nadzab as a provincial hub and gateway city.
4. Lae and Morobe Growth – Positioning Lae and Morobe as a major provincial headquarters under the “Nadzab City” vision, driving both regional and national development.
“These are the things we worked on together with Governor Wenge, my Cabinet, and the relevant ministers,” PM Marape said. “Morobe’s progress is Papua New Guinea’s progress.
Governor Wenge belongs to that generation of leaders whose legacy of service shaped our nation.”
The Prime Minister assured the people of Morobe that his government would honour and complete the projects Wenge had championed.
“Morobe has contributed great leaders to our country, and one of them lies before us today,” PM Marape said. “His memory must inspire us to serve with integrity and purpose for the betterment of Papua New Guinea.”
The Prime Minister extended his condolences to the family, people, and tribe of Morobe.
“May God bless the family, the tribe, and the people of Morobe. The passing of your leader reminds us all to do better for Morobe and for Papua New Guinea,” PM Marape said."
Poroma – Kutubu road cleared,05/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6319,"The Pimaga Police have successfully cleared road access along the Poroma–Kutubu section, which connects to the Moro oil field and further to Kikori in Gulf Province.
The road had been blocked for some time following a dispute between a local contractor responsible for maintenance and Santos over alleged overpayment issues.
Pimaga Police, led by Station Commander Sergeant Charlie Kosem, confirmed that the route is now fully open. Kutubu Local Level Government President John Pipi Kila also verified the clearance.
Speaking from Kutubu, Kila reassured trucking businesses that all previous roadblocks had been removed, ensuring safe passage and the smooth flow of operations along this vital transportation route. The reopening is expected to boost commercial activities and improve logistics in the region.
Meanwhile, Kila issued a stern warning to people along the Mendi–Moro Highway against erecting further roadblocks or disrupting business operations. He urged communities to use proper channels to address grievances rather than resorting to blockades, warning that any future disruptions would be met with firm police action.
President Kila reiterated the government’s commitment to maintaining order and ensuring that businesses can continue operating without interruption."
PM Marape reaffirms commitment to Enga,05/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6318,"The Government has committed to ensuring that the people of Enga Province directly benefit from the new Porgera Mine and from the nation’s broader economic growth under the reset agenda.
Speaking in Enga on Friday, October 3, Prime Minister James Marape said the Government’s focus is on growing the national economy so that more resources can flow back to provinces and communities.
“In the first six months of this year alone, Porgera contributed over K500 million in corporate tax,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“From that, Enga Provincial Government has already received K48 million, while K96 million for landowners is being kept in trust until the conclusion of the Community Development Agreement (CDA) this month. These benefits are far better than the old arrangements, and they reflect our government’s way of securing more for landowners, provincial governments, and the nation.”
The new Porgera arrangements will continue to generate substantial benefits, with another K500 million in corporate tax expected this year, alongside provincial and landowner dividends.
Prime Minister Marape announced that he will return to Porgera later this month to outline the different benefit streams that will be delivered.
He also endorsed the Porgera policy requiring all businesses operating at the mine to have addresses in Enga Province, but cautioned that lasting benefits require peace and order.
“How can businesses take residence in Enga when we are still engaged in tribal fights?” he asked.
“I appeal to our people to lay down arms, protect the land and environment, and allow development to take root. The Government is working to strengthen police presence and build more correctional facilities so law and order can be maintained. We want benefits to flow back to our people, but stability is essential.”
The Prime Minister commended Governor Sir Peter Ipatas for his leadership, highlighting major provincial achievements, including:
• The Innovative University of Enga, now operational, with campuses being developed
• Enga Provincial Hospital, fully commissioned and set to be fully staffed next year
• K8 million funding for a new large holding facility at Mukurumanda Correctional Service to support law enforcement.
The Prime Minister reaffirmed that Enga’s resource wealth, combined with national and provincial government commitments, places the province at the center of Papua New Guinea’s reset agenda to drive inclusive development.
“Our government has not lost faith in Enga. You are our country’s biggest language group, one province with one language. We urge you to put politics aside, unite, and take ownership of peace and progress. Resources are no longer the problem – Progeria’s new agreement is the best in the country – but our people must settle down to benefit,” Prime Minister Marape said."
NEC endorses Social Media Policy,05/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6315,"The National Executive Council (NEC) has endorsed the National Social Media Policy 2025.
This policy aims to establish a comprehensive framework that promotes safe and responsible use of social media, while ensuring that users’ actions align with national values.
By outlining guidelines and standards, the Social Media Policy 2025 seeks to address issues such as misinformation, cyberbullying, and privacy concerns, fostering a healthier online environment for all citizens.
The endorsement marks a significant step towards enhancing digital governance and protecting the integrity of social interactions within the country.
It introduces clear rules for user accountability and responsibility, including age restrictions, safeguards for children and vulnerable groups, measures to combat misinformation and disinformation, and requirements for platform accountability.
The Policy will require that all citizens aged 14-16 and above use the impending digital ID infrastructure to access social media, ensuring safe and secure online participation.
This will be complemented by a social media classification framework to guide access and content standards for users of different age groups.
With NEC’s endorsement, immediate implementation will focus on:
-	Establishment of a National e-Safety Directorate – a dedicated entity to monitor harmful content, manage misinformation and disinformation, and promote safe digital practices.
-	Formation of an Interim Inter-Agency Taskforce – comprising the Department of ICT, NICTA, Office of Censorship, Royal PNG Constabulary, and Department of Justice & Attorney General, to oversee the first phase of implementation.
-	Mandatory Digital ID Integration – introduction of SevisPass as the required digital ID credential for accessing social media platforms, strengthening online accountability.
-	Platform Accountability – all social media platforms operating in PNG will be required to legally register, comply with PNG laws, and route their traffic through the national Internet Exchange Point (IXP) to ensure transparency and oversight.
-	Awareness and Education Programs – nationwide digital literacy and e-safety campaigns to equip citizens, particularly young people, with the knowledge and skills to navigate online spaces responsibly.
The Policy also provides enforcement measures, including penalties for cyber harassment, defamation, and the spread of misinformation.

Marape Launches Reset PNG@50 to Drive Reform and Strengthen Nation,05/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6311,"Prime Minister James Marape has announced the National Executive Council’s (NEC) endorsement of Reset PNG@50, Papua New Guinea’s new reform blueprint to guide national policy, planning, and implementation over the next 20 years.
Describing it as a “decisive turning point,” Marape said Reset PNG@50 marks the nation’s reflection on 50 years of independence while charting a bold course toward Vision 2050. The roadmap was shaped through the 50-Year Review and extensive nationwide consultations, led by a Steering Committee chaired by Charles Abel, with Arthur Somare as Deputy Chair, supported by technical experts and development partners.
The review included input from the National Research Institute (NRI), Consultative Implementation and Monitoring Council (CIMC), UNDP, and Australian National University (ANU), drawing insights from more than 50 consultations across urban and rural communities.
“Reset@50 is not a new plan. Papua New Guinea has many excellent plans - what we have lacked is implementation,” Marape said. “For 50 years, progress has been slow and uneven. Reset@50 ensures we deliver on commitments and translate reforms into real outcomes for our people.”
Guiding Priorities
The reform framework focuses on five key areas:
-	Protecting the Constitution - Strengthening parliamentary governance, restoring constitutional balance, enforcing finance rules, and operationalising the Sovereign Wealth Fund.
-	Advancing Human Development - Expanding universal access to family and maternal health, and improving nationwide electricity and internet connectivity.
-	Evidence-Based Governance - Establishing a Parliamentary Budget Office, stronger oversight, and a trusted National Identity system.
-	Smart, Sustainable Growth - Driving private-sector-led growth, reforming SOEs, modernising agriculture, and freeing land for development.
-	Accountability and Delivery - Reforming the bureaucracy, cleansing the payroll, and strengthening results-driven service delivery.
Quick Wins (Next Two Years)
The government has outlined immediate priorities, including stabilising the budget, improving frontline health and education, removing ghost names from payrolls, and fast-tracking rural electricity and internet rollout.
Delivery and Oversight
A new delivery unit, headed by former Deputy Prime Minister Charles Abel, will oversee implementation with support from public servants, private sector experts, and development partners.
“Charles Abel has the track record and vision to guide Reset@50 from planning into action,” Marape said. “His leadership will be vital in ensuring the next two years deliver real outcomes for our people.”
All government agencies and state-owned enterprises are required to cooperate, with non-compliance treated as a dismissible offence. Regular progress reports will be submitted to NEC and made public.
Call to Action
Marape urged all Papua New Guineans to take ownership of the national reform effort.
“Government alone cannot deliver Reset@50. This is about our people holding leaders accountable. Demand results, question decisions, and participate actively. Only then will these reforms succeed,” he said.
“Do not leave nation-building to politicians and bureaucrats alone. If each of us plays our part - in our villages, churches, schools, and workplaces - together we will transform PNG. This is our moment to unite and declare that the next 20 years will be different. Bung wantaim, raka hebou - together, with courage and conviction, we will reset our country and build the Papua New Guinea we have always dreamed of.”
Marape concluded: “We are ready to reset. We are ready to deliver. We are ready to build a stronger Papua New Guinea.”"

Over 200 Students Attend NEXTGEN ICT Expo,04/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6305,"The National Information Communication Technology Authority (NICTA) hosted an ICT School Exposition yesterday where students from both primary and secondary schools in NCD and Central received first-hand information about telecommunications, how it works and most importantly, how to use it safely.
NICTA CEO, Kila Gulo-Vui in stating the importance of this expo said students are the future of this country and knowledge in digital education is important for them to be relevant with the world around them, and be made aware of the digital environment in the world today.
The CEO said young people have been the focus of NICTA’s digital connectivity programs because in 2024, reports showed that 43 per cent of 15–24-year-olds in low-income countries like PNG used internet.
“So as an organization or as a government, we’re committed to promoting universal and meaningful connectivity for all and to reach our overarching goal of inclusive digital society by bridging a variety of digital divide. It makes sense that we put special efforts into supporting digital change makers of the future and that is you,” the CEO said.
Secretary for DICT Steven Matainaho addressed the students, encouraging them to be bold in reaching into the digital space in developing new interventions.
He encouraged them to be committed and consistence in what they plan to do.
Matainaho gave the students two guiding points to be guided by in their life of learning;
1. Education is important and
2. Just do it, no excuses, do it, go for it.
Students were given opportunity to explore the different set ups by various digital partners, ask questions and learn from those industries.
Digicel PNG Limited was the Platinum sponsor of the expo.
Digicel’s display showcased the model computer lab for secondary schools which is now being distributed in 50 selected schools across the country with laptops and free internet by Digicel.

Ambassador Supandy’s visit included meeting Indonesian migrant workers at New Britain Palm Oil Limited (NBPOL), inspecting oil palm projects, and holding talks with Governor Sasindran Muthuvel, the Minister for Oil Palm, OPIC, and NBPOL representatives.
Upon arrival, Ambassador Supandy paid a courtesy call on Governor Muthuvel. Their discussions centered on trade, investment, and education, with Governor Muthuvel extending an invitation to Indonesian investors to explore opportunities in establishing an independent oil mill for small growers.
The talks also touched on the Kimbe Port expansion project, a $2 billion (K340–400 million) Australian Infrastructure Program investment, aimed at resolving vessel congestion and ensuring uninterrupted supply of essential goods.
Governor Muthuvel emphasised that oil palm remains central to the livelihoods of block holders in the province, but highlighted challenges caused by fluctuating prices. He noted the importance of diversifying operations, reducing reliance on large companies, and preparing for future markets such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
Ambassador Supandy reaffirmed Indonesia’s interest in strengthening cooperation with PNG in palm oil, trade, forestry, and education, noting PNG’s growing role as a member of the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries. He also invited local leaders and businesses to participate in Trade Expo Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest trade event, which attracts over 30,000 visitors annually.

Porgera LO funds kept in trust,04/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6301,"K96 million of landowner benefits derived from the Porgera Mine are being kept in trust pending the conclusion of the Community Development Agreement (CDA) process.
Prime Minister James Marape in highlighting the benefits that are coming from the reopened Porgera Mine told landowners their funds were secured.
“In the first six months of this year alone, Porgera contributed over K500 million in corporate tax,” Prime Minister Marape said. “From that, Enga Provincial Government has already received K48 million, while K96 million for landowners is being kept in trust until the conclusion of the Community Development Agreement (CDA) this month. These benefits are far better than the old arrangements, and they reflect our government’s way of securing more for landowners, provincial governments, and the nation.”
He reaffirmed his government’s commitment to ensuring that the people of Enga Province directly benefit from the new Porgera Mine, and from the nation’s broader economic growth under the reset agenda.
Speaking in Enga yesterday, Prime Minister Marape said the Government’s focus is on growing the national economy so that more resources can flow back to provinces and communities.
He stressed that the new Porgera arrangements will continue to generate substantial benefits, with another K500 million in corporate tax expected this year, alongside provincial and landowner dividends.
Prime Minister Marape announced he will return to Porgera later this month to outline the different benefit streams that will be delivered. He also endorsed the Porgera policy requiring all businesses operating at the mine to have addresses in Enga Province, but cautioned that lasting benefits require peace and order.
“How can businesses take residence in Enga when we are still engaged in tribal fights?” he asked. “I appeal to our people to lay down arms, protect land and environment, and allow development to take root. The Government is working to strengthen police presence and build more correctional facilities so law and order can be maintained. We want benefits to flow back to our people, but stability is essential.”"

Manning Directs Senior Police To Report To Highlands Posts,04/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6295,"Following the appointment of Anthony Junior Wagambie as Operations Commander for joint security operations in the Upper Highlands, Police Commissioner David Manning has summoned senior police personnel tasked to lead the restoration of law and order in Highlands hotspots, and ordered them to depart for their respective posts effective immediately.
Senior personnel summoned by Commissioner Manning included Operational Commander, Commander Anthony Wagambie Jr; Divisional Commander Western End, Chief Superintendent Joseph Tondop; Southern Highlands Provincial Police Commander, Superintendent Epenes Nili; and, Hela Provincial Police Commander, Superintendent Michael Welly.
Commissioner Manning is concerned that despite the rise in crime in the highlands, less number of arrests have been made.
“The low numbers of arrest in these commands is unacceptable. It will not be tolerated. Arrest will be delivered or those in these commands will be held to account.
“Disciplined forces are not normal public sector agencies, we have chains of command and personnel who fail to follow directions will face the consequences.”
He said he has been tolerant, but enough is enough and officers that are listed for deployment will be in place to carry out their duties or be stood aside.
“There is very little our senior operations personnel can do from behind a desk in Port Moresby when shots are being fired, people being attacked and homes being burned in the Highlands,” Commissioner said at a briefing with senior police.
“The threats we face from domestic terrorist groups that use violence as part of wider criminal activities will be overcome, and this is a law enforcement operation that is being carried out on the ground in affected areas.
“I am disappointed that some in senior leadership positions are not on the ground in the Highlands leading the security force personnel, and they can and will do better.
“These senior personnel will be in place in the Highlands, working with Commander Wagambie who has responsibility for restoring order in these troubled areas.
Commissioner Manning also sounded his disgust at sorcery related violence seen on video over recent days.
“Investigations are underway into this barbaric attack, and police will move in on the community involved.
“Sorcery violence is not a part of our culture in the modern world, and everyone has a responsibility to stand up and stop these pathetic actions.
“As this investigation continues and additional information is available it will be shared with the public.
“While the causes of violence requires community leaders to take charge of their people before crimes are committed, the full force of the law is at our disposal to clean up the threat that they pose to innocent people.
“I have given direction that security forces will have zero tolerance in confronting domestic terrorists, particularly when weapons are used.
“Security forces also need the co-operation and support of local leaders stepping up and doing the right thing.
“Any community leader who protects violent criminals is just as guilty as the domestic terrorists, murderers and rapists they are protecting.”"
Simbu College Makes Progress,04/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6293,"Simbu Teachers College has taken a major step forward in rebuilding its future by purchasing a brand-new ten-seater Toyota Land Cruiser using tuition fees, after years of struggle that nearly led to its closure.
For almost eleven years, the college was on the brink of shutting down due to poor management and lack of support. However, with the leadership of former principal James Buri, current principal Peter Kol, and board chairman Moses Kawage, the institution has been revitalized with better governance and renewed confidence.
Mr. Kol said it has been extremely challenging to run a large institution with only K600 in the account, but with the support of his staff and the school management committee, the college managed to survive. “This vehicle marks a new chapter in improving the services for our students and administration,” he said.
Simbu Teachers College, which caters to students from all six districts of Simbu Province and other provinces, has not received consistent support from the provincial government in the last five years.
Despite this, the leadership acknowledged the contributions of Governor Noah Kool and Sinasine-Yongumugl MP Kerenga Kua for assisting with classrooms, vehicles, and a dining hall.
Board chairman Mr. Kawage praised the teamwork between staff and the governing council, stating that good management practices have lifted the standards of the institution.
He emphasised the urgent need for further infrastructure development, including classrooms, dormitories, and transportation, to give students a better chance at quality education.
The college is now appealing to the Simbu Provincial Government and MPs from all six districts to step in with stronger support to secure its long-term future."

This phase includes a feasibility study of the project.
Yangoru Saussia MP Richard Maru said the project aims to establish a long-term power solution and the scope and details of this project will be established once the feasibility study is completed.
“None of us know about how much megawatts it will produce, what the cost of construction is, none of us know that. This will be defined in the feasibility study.
“We will engage an internationally reputable company known for conducting feasibility studies to conduct the study, supported by the entities that signed the MoU.
He added that the long-term dream of this project is not only to produce power but also to sell power.
Maru said the only challenge now is to bring in investors, with the support of the government, to fund this project.
“If we build this hydro, it will be clean, cheaper and reliable for all the villages to access. It will open doors for our people to live in modern houses as well,” Maru said.
PNG Power CEO, Paul Bayly, said PNG Power will support this project. However, they need the support of the community to drive this project.
The Yanguro Saussia district is venturing into agricultural and livestock investments, hence, power is needed to drive these economic activities."
Rainbow needs proper market facility,03/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6290,"Rainbow Estate market vendors are calling on the government to establish a proper market facility for them to use. Currently, the vendors do not have a proper market facility, and are selling their produce at the side of the road.
These vendors are often chased by police or come into conflict with PMV operators. The dust created by passing vehicles is also another hazard.
Miriam Peter has been selling her produce at the Rainbow Estate informal market for years. Her challenge has always been finding enough space to trade. Those times when there isn’t enough space available, she would go to Gerehu market or Waigani market, but even vendors there know she’s not a regular and would often tell her to go back to her regular marketplace.
“When we go to Waigani, the vendors there will remove our food and tell us to go back to where we came from. Gerehu vendors will do the same. Therefore, we make sure to always clean the roadside and sell our produce because we have nowhere else to sell our produce,” Peter said.
While Vendor Merilyn Dickson said a proper market facility is what they need to store and sell their produce.
“We carry our produce to the market every day because of no proper place to store our produce. Therefore, if the government establishes our own marketplace, it will ease that burden,” she said.
Chief Secretary to the Government and long-time Rainbow Estate resident, Ambassador Ivan Pomaleu supports the call for a proper market infrastructure.
Pomaleu said when the market facility is established, PMV buses and other vehicles will be parked in the right place, and pedestrians can access the market facility safely and with ease."

The foundation NTP was launched by the O’Neil Government in 2017 when Minister Maru was then the Minister for Trade, Commerce, and Industry. The Marape-Rosso Government had commenced the mid-term review of the NTP with the assistance of the PNG European Union (EU) Delegation.
Minister Maru said the mid-term review was necessary from PNG’s national trade perspective, to ensure the NTP was on track to achieve its goals and recalibrate the country’s trade strategy in light of current national and global challenges.
“PNG’s trade performance and policy implementation over the past eight years need a thorough assessment so successes can be built and shortcomings addressed. The review will help PNG align its trade policy with recent domestic priorities such as the Medium-Term Development Plan IV and post-COVID economic recovery, and external developments like environmental considerations, new market opportunities in Asia, and evolving World Trade Organization rules.
The review will enable PNG to adopt international best practices, foster stakeholder engagement, and ultimately ensure that trade policy remains effective and relevant,” said Minister Maru.
The three main elements to review are:
1. A review of the NTP to take stock of the progress, determine how effective the policy measures have contributed to the attainment of the objectives, and identify key challenges with implementation.
2. A prospective assessment that takes into account the current and emerging trade issues at the international and national levels and recommends adjustments.
3. Review of the NTP’s Strategic Implementation Plan and integration of its findings.

“The result of January 10th has caused our mothers to struggle to get service outside. Options and opportunities to look for groceries were hard. Our mothers and fathers had to travel far to look for groceries. Therefore, I appeal to you all that those business houses that are doing business in our community and those that will come later, it's up to us to secure them.
“Police capacity is not enough to cater to all sectors in the city, especially our suburbs. Therefore, we have to self-regulate; we have to be the ones who hold our community together in good and bad times.
“We must blame ourselves for the January 10th incident because at that time, children and adults celebrated the looting in our very own community. It shows that the community cannot self-regulate; we lose control when the higher authority is lacking. When the police withdrawdraw their service, the community cannot be held together.
“The government will give us service, and the business house will provide service, but it is our responsibility to maintain the stability of our community. Today's livelihood demands our own stability.
“I urge our mothers and fathers to take control of our children, so that we can worry about what the authorities can do to us,” he said."

Plans to revive IIimo farm,02/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6279,"The Central Provincial Government in partnership with the Ministry of Trade and Investment, is putting in plans to revive the Ilimo Farm.
The Governor for Central Province Rufina Peter met with the Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru recently, to discuss a way forward in reviving the Ilimo Farm just outside Port Moresby.
The Ilimo Farm was once a huge supplier of chicken meat and eggs to Port Moresby. It is owned by the Central Provincial Government’s business arm, Central Province Development Corp.
Governor Rufina expressed her keen interest in reviving this farm to supply chicken meat, eggs, and day-old chicks to meet the requirements of Port Moresby and the Southern Region.
Governor Rufina and Minister Maru also discussed about a cattle industry in the Central Province to produce up to 10,000 cattle required to supply the Hugo Canning cannery.
Governor Rufina said the Central Provincial Government can partner the National Government through Kumul Agriculture, Taylor Pacific, and other stakeholders to go into these large-scale agriculture projects in Central Province.
Minister Maru welcomed the prospect of reviving this farm.
“The Ilimo Farm is a prime property, and it needs to be revived immediately. My Ministry and Department will fully support this project because we cannot continue to import K200 million worth of chickens annually. The Marape-Rosso Government is keen to replace all chicken imports and be a net exporter of chicken,” said Minister Maru.
Also present in the meeting were the Chairman of the PNG Poultry Industry Association Chis Prestwood, and the General Manager of Hugo Canning Jeremy Fry, who both agreed that this was a very exciting opportunity and the sooner the project starts the better.
“These are industries that are ready to pop,” said Mr. Fry.
Minister Maru now awaits a joint investment proposal to be submitted to his office to progress these projects of national significance.
“For cattle, unless we produce local beef to supply Hugo Canning, we cannot reduce the price of Ox and Palm, which has now increased by nearly 100 percent compared to previous years because of the expensive imports from Australia and the declining Kina value,” said Minister Maru.
Meanwhile, Governor Rufina raised concerns that the Ilimo Dairy Farm, owned by Innovative Agriculture Industry had not declared a profit since its establishment. Central Provincial Government is a 30 percent shareholder and has put down 400 hectares of land for the farm.
Governor Rufina expressed her disappointment and said it was high time a new management was put in place, and for the farm to invest in long-life milk with a better breed of dairy cattle to increase milk production at the farm."

Talks on FATF grey listing continues as PNG reaches deadline,02/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6277,"Papua New Guinea is at a critical juncture as the October deadline set by by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to address deficiencies in Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML/CTF) inorder to avoid consequences of grey listing is finally here.
The AML/CTF/CPF Conference continued at APEC Haus today, bringing together government agencies, financial institutions, civil society, and international partners under the banner:
“Fighting Financial Crime is Everyone’s Business.”
In her opening address, Governor Elizabeth Genia of the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) issued a stark warning: PNG’s placement under increased monitoring by the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) demands urgent and credible action.
“Success will not be measured by reports written, but by criminals held accountable and proceeds of crime recovered,” Genia declared.
The Governor emphasized that PNG’s 2024 Mutual Evaluation Report exposed serious deficiencies in the effectiveness of its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing framework. Without swift reforms, PNG risks prolonged grey-listing, which could damage its financial reputation and economic prospects.
The conference, hosted by BPNG in partnership with Transparency International PNG (TIPNG), is open to the public and aims to foster national unity in combating corruption. Genia called on all sectors—government, private industry, civil society, and citizens—to take ownership of the fight against illicit finance.
“These crimes do not exist in isolation, they affect our livelihoods, our access to services, our opportunities, and our wellbeing,” she said.
Sessions have focused on: Enforcement under the AML/CFT Act, Regional crime trends and typologies, the role of the Financial Analysis and Supervision Unit (FASU),Regulation of virtual assets, and strengthening oversight of Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs)
Governor Genia outlined a series of reforms already underway, including updates to the Proceeds of Crime Act, the formation of joint task forces, and enhanced inter-agency coordination. She stressed that financial inclusion must remain a priority, ensuring that AML measures do not exclude vulnerable populations from the formal economy.
“Government has endorsed these reforms. Agencies represented here today are under clear instructions to fulfill their roles,” Genia affirmed.
International partners such as Australia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are supporting PNG’s efforts to build a resilient and transparent financial system.
As the conference enters its final day, the message is clear, PNG must act decisively. The final communiqué is expected to outline next steps for national implementation, with a focus on measurable outcomes and accountability.
“Let us learn, contribute, and act together,” Genia urged. “These discussions will translate into better outcomes—helping reduce our time on the grey list and building a stronger, more respected financial system for the people of Papua New Guinea.”
What Is Grey Listing?
— A Simple Explanation for Everyone
If you’ve never heard of “grey listing,” here’s what it means:
When a country is grey listed, it means FATF has found serious weaknesses in how that country handles financial crime. The country is not being punished, but it is under close watch and must fix the problems quickly.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is a global watchdog that checks how well countries stop financial crimes like money laundering, terrorism financing, and corruption.
Think of it like being put on probation. The country must improve its laws and enforcement, catch and punish financial criminals, work better across government agencies, and prove it’s serious about protecting its economy.
For PNG, being grey listed could mean delays in international money transfers, less foreign investment, higher costs for businesses and banks, and damage to the country’s reputation.
Governor Genia and other leaders warned that PNG is very likely to be grey listed by February 2026 unless urgent reforms are made. The deadline to show progress is October 2025.
Everyone has a role to play, citizens, businesses, lawyers, banks, and government agencies, to help PNG avoid grey listing and build a stronger, safer financial system."
Cabinet approves PNG-Aus Defence Treaty,02/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6276,"Cabinet has formally approved the Mutual Defence Treaty between Papua New Guinea and Australia, elevating the two countries’ defence and security partnership to its highest level in history.
“Australia has only one other mutual defence treaty of this type and at our request Papua New Guinea will now sign this treaty”. Prime Minister Marape said. “This reflects the depth of trust, history, and shared future between our two nations.”
The Prime Minister clarified that the treaty will undergo the constitutional Section 117 process, with the ratification presented to the PNG Parliament, while Australia will undertake its own ratification through its Parliament in Canberra.
“Our Constitution is not offended by this agreement. Section 206 of our Constitution allows for our Defence Force to work in synergy with other visiting defence forces, and this treaty is consistent with that provision,” Prime Minister Marape emphasised.
The relationship between PNG and Australia is long and enduring and has been anchored in many areas of cooperation. For Defence, PNG operated under a Status of Forces Agreement after independence and, in 2013, signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement with Australia.
“Now this treaty elevates our relationship to the highest level, where force synergies, and capacity development for interoperability is reached. Australia is our foundational relationship country. We are geographically close and beyond geography, our people have coexisted well before 1975 and after independence. Today, Australia remains our single biggest bilateral partner, and consistent with our past, we are shaping our future,” the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Marape stressed that the treaty is not about geopolitics.
“Papua New Guinea is a big country with over 10 million people and security fragility is evident and it is PNG’s interest to develop our security forces to best standards and with this synergy, I am certain we will reach this goal.
“This treaty allows PNG’s defence capacity to be elevated by leveraging Australian defence capabilities. This partnership strengthens our ability to respond to our country’s key security priorities.
The treaty outlines steps to modernise and strengthen PNG’s defence capacity across all domains:
• Navy and Maritime Security: Increased capacity to police PNG’s vast maritime borders.
• Air Wing and Air Defence: Enhanced air force capacity through new capabilities and training.
• Infantry and Land Battalions: Strengthened land forces and the establishment of special forces arrangements.
• Reserve and National Guard: Development of 3,000 reservists and national volunteers, with provisions for up to 10,000 Papua New Guineans to serve with the Australian Defence Force under dual arrangements, while PNG builds its own 7,000-strong Defence Force.
“This treaty is not just about maintaining barracks and boats. We are investing in both hardware and software for defence so that we can effectively police our borders and safeguard our nation,” Prime Minister Marape explained.
Prime Minister Marape assured the nation that PNG’s sovereignty remains intact.
“Our Defence Force will always report to the Commander of the PNG Defence Force. Australians, including Papua New Guineans enlisted into the Australian Defence Force, will report to the Australian commander.
“Both forces will train and operate side by side, but sovereignty is never compromised. We also respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our neighbours.”
The treaty also recognises that both PNG and Australia maintain defence relationships with other nations. “Provisions are in place to respect third-party relationships,” Prime Minister Marape said.
Looking to the future, Prime Minister Marape described the treaty as a foundation for the next chapter of PNG’s history.
“Our sovereignty is defined by our national security. This treaty strengthens PNG’s security and defence capacities as we embark on the next 50 years. It is about ensuring Papua New Guinea is safe, secure, and prepared to protect its people and borders.”"
Public holiday for Morobe tomorrow,02/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6275,"Only Morobe Province will have a public holiday tomorrow (Friday, October 3rd) to receive the body of their late Governor, Luther Wenge.
Lae MP and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, who is also the chief mourner, has confirmed this afternoon.
A gazette has been released this afternoon by the Governor-General, Bob Dadae, declaring a public holiday for Morobe.
President of  Lae Chamber of Commerce John Byrne called on businesses in Lae to observe the public holiday tomorrow.
“We advise businesses to seriously consider not to operate tomorrow as recommended by Metropolitan Superintendent, Chris Kunyaban.
“There will be a lot of people in town to meet the late Governor’s body and join the procession around the city.
“The majority will be here to mourn, grieve and pay respect to the legacy of the late Governor,” continued Byrne.
“A small number will look for trouble and create potential mayhem, under the pretense of grieving – as happened at late Great Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare’s, or calling out, threatening or attacking business for lack of respect.”
Chief mourner Rosso further clarified that there will be no public holiday on Wednesday, October 8th, for the late Wenge’s funeral mass.
“His funeral mass will be held on Wednesday next week at the Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium,” underlined Rosso. “Public are welcome to attend.
However, Wednesday there will not be a public holiday due to the fact that we will have our national exams running. And we do not want to disrupt that for our children.
“Governor Wenge, as a strong advocate for education, I’m certain would not want his children’s exams interrupted.
“However, I ask everyone in Morobe to respect his legacy and ensure we mourn with peace and respect.
“Our late governor’s burial site will be in line with his last wishes, and he will be laid to rest at Baindoang village, Nawaeb district.”"
Fuel Security Boost for PNG,02/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6272,"Islands Petroleum Limited has entered into a sale agreement with Puma Energy to acquire its bulk fuel depot assets in Kimbe and Kavieng. The move is set to enhance fuel security for thousands of Papua New Guineans.
The transaction, which is pending regulatory approval from the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC), marks a major milestone in strengthening the supply of reliable fuel services in regional PNG.
“As a home-grown company, we are uniquely positioned to deliver reliable fuel services across regional Papua New Guinea,” said Nathan Bluett, Chief Executive Officer of Islands Petroleum.
“This milestone, in the year PNG celebrates 50 years of independence, extends our commitment to serving communities with the same dedication we’ve shown since our founding. Reliable and uninterrupted fuel supply is essential to economic growth, commerce, healthcare, education, and the daily needs of PNG families.”
Founded in Rabaul more than 40 years ago, Islands Petroleum has grown from a provincial distributor to a trusted national player.
The acquisition will strengthen fuel security for over 450,000 people across New Ireland and West New Britain provinces.
Puma Energy will work closely with Islands Petroleum during the transition to ensure continuity of operations and service. The company confirmed that its retail sites in Kimbe and Kavieng are not part of the sale and will remain operational.
Daniel Duffau, General Manager of Puma Energy PNG, said, “This agreement marks a strategic step in streamlining our operations to focus on areas where we can deliver the greatest value to our customers and stakeholders. We are confident these assets will thrive under IPL’s ownership.”
Both companies stressed their ongoing commitment to safety, investment, and ensuring community needs are met as PNG continues to grow."
Wards in Rabaul reconcile,02/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6271,"A plea for peace from mothers and women was finally realised in Balanataman Local Level Government area in Rabaul, East New Britain Province, this week.
It was pleasing news from the recent fights between youths from Ratavul Karavia and Volavolo wards in the Balanataman LLG.
A march for ‘Re-Union for Peace’ this week was held along the Nonga road from Volavolo Ward by Youths from Volavolo to the Ratavul Mission Grounds to join the Ratavul Youths who were waiting to receive them to Reconcile and Reunite for Peace.
A Reconciliation and Reunion for Peace ceremony was held in response to the tensions and unfortunate incidents, including fights and the destruction of homes. During this gathering, the community sought healing and forgiveness.
The reconciliation came about following constant meetings between Ward Development Committee members and the community and church elders. This marked a breakthrough in resolving the ongoing conflicts between the youths of Volavolo and Ratavul to announce that from this point forward, there will be ‘NO more fighting’.
Church elder and evangelist Bernie Benson delivered a powerful message inspired by the Word of God, emphasizing the importance of intervention and forgiveness. He proclaimed that this reconciliation signifies God's supernatural intervention through the Holy Spirit, restoring peace in the hearts of our young people.
“It was all God's doing and making. It was a powerful Kingdom Intervention as the Word of God, which is the Word of Peace, was released, opening up hearts and minds. Praise God and thank you to those who have been praying for peace between Volavolo and Ratavul,” he said.
Elder Benson shared a profound message underscoring that true peace comes from having a relationship with Jesus Christ. He pointed out that when individuals have peace in their hearts, they are more capable of forgiving others, as highlighted in Matthew 6:14-15
""When you forgive others, God will forgive you of your sins.”
During the ceremony, all participants were led in a prayer of confession, repentance, and forgiveness, affirming their commitment to embracing Christ as their Saviour and Lord.
After the prayer, invoking God's blessings upon the youths, they lined up to shake hands, symbolizing their newfound commitment to peace and reconciliation.
A reconciliation ceremony was also held in which both wards contributed towards the funeral expenses for a recently deceased community member. The youths from Volavolo, Ratavul, and Karavia wards embraced each other, shaking hands as a sign of moving forward in the right direction toward lasting peace.
To further promote harmony and cleanliness, both wards participated in a mass cleanup of the roads, removing debris and ensuring safe passage for the traveling public.
The roads have now been cleared, allowing the general public to commute smoothly to and from town and Nonga. Local police will conduct periodic patrols to enhance safety in the area."

CCDA 3rd National Summit begins,02/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6263,"With the challenges of climate change and its effects on economies throughout the world, addressing the issues remains a vital role for stakeholders in many nations. Today, Port Moresby hosted the 3rd Climate Change Summit 2025 to address PNG’s concerns and the way forward.
The 2-day Summit, with the first day concluding today, was based on discussions around this year’s theme, “Empowering inclusivity and accelerating climate change action for resilience and sustainable PNG”.
The meeting brought together high-level delegates from all stakeholders, hosted by the Minister for Environment Conservation and Climate Change Development Authority, Simo Kilepa, and the Acting Managing Director for CCDA, Debra Sungi.
The summit aims to provide a platform to reflect on PNG’s journey, showcase ongoing efforts and map out bold actions for the next 50 years of climate resilience, sustainability and inclusive development.
Minister Kilepa also highlighted at the summit the challenges PNG faces on climate change.
“Rising seas are swallowing our coastlines, extreme weather continues to destroy our villages and shifting seasons threaten the food our people depend on. This is not a future problem. It is here.
It is now.  That is why this Summit matters. Over the next two days, we will bring together government, private sector, development partners, provincial leaders and community voices. We will recognize those who have worked tirelessly in this fight and share knowledge that can guide our way forward,” Mr. Kilepa said.
He said since the last Summit, Papua New Guinea has taken bold steps that show our people and the world that we are serious about climate action. The steps taken included the following:
1.	Reform and Governance: Climate Change Management Act 2023 amended and established National Climate Change Board.
2.	Carbon Market Regulation: The NEC approved our Carbon Market Regulation 2024. This opens the door for international investment in our forests and carbon projects, while ensuring that benefits flow back to our people.
3.	Domestic Revenue for Climate Action: We introduced the Green Fee Initiative. This is a homegrown measure to generate revenue from visitors to our shores - funds that will be reinvested to sustain climate action across the country.
4.	Global Finance Breakthroughs: Earlier this year, we hosted the 42nd Green Climate Fund Board Meeting here in Port Moresby. As a result, PNG secured US$63.4 million in Results-Based Payments for REDD+, and USD 9 million for the Source Pacific Drinking Water Project. These are not abstract numbers – they mean resources in our hands to deliver change on the ground.
5.	 Community-Level Action-BRCC Projects: Through the Building Resilience to Climate Change program, tangible improvements have been delivered, including new boats, wharves for safe transport, rainwater catchments and sanitation systems, resilience projects across Bougainville, East New Britain, and Milne Bay, Morobe and Manus.
Minister Kilepa said these and other achievements show what strong leadership, sound policy and close partnerships can achieve.
He acknowledged the Marape-Rosso Government leadership in climate change, in-country and on the global stage. Adding that the achievements mentioned are wins for our government, our people, and for our future generation.
The second and final day of the summit takes place tomorrow."
Madang police ready to deliver LLG elections,01/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6261,"Madang police are ready to support and safeguard the delivery of the Local Level Government council elections in the province, according to Provincial Police Commander Acting Superintendent Robert Baim.
He issued a stern warning to anyone seeking to disrupt the elections, stating that the police will swiftly respond to any attempt to compromise the process or to influence the votes.
“We are on standby to assist the Electoral Commission in delivering the long-awaited council elections for our people. Following a sequence of recent events, including the successful Usino-Bundi by-elections in August and nationwide events such as the 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations, we remain well prepared to serve our community and nation,” stated PPC Baim.
During an LLG elections brief today with the PPC and station commander Patrick Walis and Rural Commander Bola Rimula, much concern was raised around polling resources and election logistics constraints.
The meeting also highlighted that the Electoral Commission, the Provincial Government, and each member of the districts must ensure police presence is felt throughout the polling and counting period.
Madang is also one of the provinces that will pilot the LLG president voting. Baim said facilitating ease of access for police personnel to certain remote locations is vital to prevent and maintain law and order.
He said in certain areas, there is no road access, and a chopper or plane landing is the only option, whilst the majority of regions can be accessed via vehicles. However, an urgent need for vehicles is also on demand due to the limited vehicles.
Looking ahead to the next 50 years, the PPC said the focus must be on what lies ahead. Attitudes and values must evolve, and everyone must adhere to established rules and processes as the time comes to appoint running leaders.
“Time to eat lamb flaps and drink cola is gone. Think about how our children will live in the next 50 years, and seriously choose leaders with vision who can guide this nation towards a better Papua New Guinea tomorrow,” Baim added.
The people of Madang have been urged to evaluate leaders based on merit and vision, not merely on factors such as quick return for a short-term, cheap reward, or just because of popularity and relations.
PPC Baim stressed the need to aspire to see changes in mindsets, attitudes, and behaviours, calling on everyone to work with security forces to ensure that the election of good leaders takes due course.
“The power is in the hands of the people. The past is behind us, and the dawn of a new era is upon us. Madang police will not tolerate any misbehavior during the polling and counting period,” PPC Baim reiterated.
Meanwhile, Provincial Election Manager Sponsa Navi, said polling takes place for 7 to 14 days, and counting will take around 3-7 days, but will depend on the LLGs and how organized they are."

Magistrates Judicial Orientation program opens,01/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6254,"The three-day Magistrates Judicial Orientation program opened today in Port Moresby and ends on Friday, October 3.
The purpose of this program is to promote judicial competence by assisting newly appointed magistrates to perform their duties and promote excellence in the delivery of justice in district courts.
Nine Magistrates from the Solomon Islands have joined their counterparts in Port Moresby for this program. The program aims to highlight how magistrates apply and balance written law with custom, especially in land, family, and community justice matters.
It will also emphasise conflict of interest, resilience, security, trauma, stress, and mental health.
PNG Chief Magistrate Mark Pupaka said the participation of Solomon Islands in this program signifies the collaboration between the two countries, working together to address judicial issues in both countries.
He said magistrates in both countries often serve remote islands and provinces, with limited resources and heavy caseloads. Therefore, the sessions will stress practical judgment writing, case management with scarce resources, and using technology where possible.
Solomon Islands High Commissioner to PNG William McDonald Soaki said Solomon Islands and PNG have similar law and order challenges and common law systems. Therefore, the lessons learned and experiences shared through this program will be relevant in strengthening the magisterial sectors of both countries.
He urges the magistrates to be attentive, productive, and to gain the necessary knowledge needed to serve their people.
“Take every opportunity these three days to listen, to learn something new, and to share your experiences openly. Strengthen your networks; the knowledge you gain here will not only enhance your own capacity but also contribute to meaningful outputs and ultimately to the people you serve in Solomon Islands and PNG, those who look to you for justice.
“Always remember that your role extends beyond interpreting law; you are a guardian of fairness, you protect the rights, and you build public trust. The decisions you make can restore hope, bring peace to families and communities, and reinforce the confidence of our people in institutions of state,” Soaki said.
Meanwhile, a general course evaluation will be completed at the end of the program. A formal review and report will be prepared for the Magistrate Service Executive management after the completion of the program."

Marape Proposes Distinct Budget for Opposition,01/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6252,"Prime Minister James Marape has highlighted the importance of funding the office of the opposition so it fully disperses its check and balance function.
The Prime Minister revealed this during the submission of the 2026 National Parliament Budget plan to his office by the Speaker Job Pomat.
Among his government’s planned reforms for the parliament is to have a separate budget line for the Opposition.
“We want the Opposition to be properly resourced, not held to ransom, because they are an essential part of the Check-and-Balance mechanism for our Democracy. A vibrant Parliament requires strong Committees and an empowered Opposition that can hold Government to account,” he stated.
According to opposition leader, Douglas Tomuriesa, the Office of the Opposition is dependent on funding from the speaker and clerks.
“We operate under the mercy of the Speaker and the Clerks. If they have additional funds, we are given some money to operate otherwise we just toughen it out by what is provided,” Tomuriesa stated.
The Speaker emphasized the need for parliament as the legislature to receive the same level of diligence and support as the Executive and Judiciary.
The 2026 National Parliament Budget Submission includes provisions for physical renovations to Parliament House, modernisation of ICT systems for a “Paperless Parliament,” and operational support to strengthen the capacity of Members of Parliament and Parliamentary Staff, as well as Parliament Library and Archives.
Prime Minister Marape welcomed the Submission and commended the Speaker’s leadership in ensuring Parliament is adequately resourced to meet both present and future needs.
“Our Parliament is not just another building. It is the very 'Seat of Papua New Guinea’s Democracy'. As we celebrate our 50th Independence Anniversary, we must honour and invest in the institution that embodies the voice of our people,” Prime Minister Marape said.
The Prime Minister noted that the Government has already demonstrated strong commitment to the Judiciary through the construction of the new National Court Complex, and pledged that similar support will be extended to the National Parliament.
The Government invested over K400 million over six years to support the construction of the state-of-the-art Court Complex that now houses both the Supreme and National Courts.
Prime Minister Marape added that his Government will go further by maintaining Parliament and constructing a 'new D-Wing', ensuring Parliament is fit for purpose in the decades ahead, making it a modernised 21st century institution worthy of Democracy.
Moving forward, the Prime Minister assured the Speaker and the people of Papua New Guinea that his Government will give serious consideration to the K615 million Submission as part of the 2026 National Budget process."
Madang Province ahead with LLG election preparations,01/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6251,"Madang Province is ready to go for LLG polling on October 25th as set by the Electoral Commission last week. The deferment of elections from September 27th to October 25th has actually given the province more time to tidy up their preparations with the more of shipment of polling to  different polling locations.
According to the Election Manager for Madang Sponsa Navi, most of the materials have been already arrived at the polling locations except for Kovon and Simbai LLGs in the Middle Ramu district due to road accessibility. These two locations will have a plane drop their materials by next week.
“As part of the preparations that are underway, all officials have been in training the last couple of weeks. Deployment of all materials have been ongoing with the last two LLGs in the Middle Ramu district to be dropped off later this week or by next week.
With the deferral, everything is running accordingly and we hope that in time for polling, everything should be in place already,” stated Mr. Navi.
While Madang Province has been allocated K2.8 million to run this election, Mr. Navi stated that that he hopes to receive the full funding in the coming weeks.
The Provincial Elections Steering Committee also been revealed that the Madang Provincial Government had allocated K800, 000 to collaboratively run the elections. Mr. Navi confirmed that K400, 000 has been released but held back due to the deferral and should be given to Electoral Office next month.
The plan is to ensure no debts are carried forward after elections. This was successfully done for the Usino-Bundi by-election and the same strategy will be applied to the LLG elections.
According to Mr. Navi from the previous elections, an estimate of K2 million remains in debt to service providers. This can only be cleared off when money is made available from the electoral commission.
Despite the debts, it is anticipated that this election should be carried out peacefully in the province."
Sign language milestone strengthens justice,30/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6248,"Papua New Guinea has taken a historic step toward inclusive justice with the certification of two national sign language interpreters at the 2025 World Association of Sign Language Interpreters Oceania Conference in Fiji.
The achievement ensures greater access to police, courts, and correctional services for Deaf citizens, formally embedding sign language within PNG’s justice system.
The graduates, Anna Thomas and Francisca Sam of the Department for Community Development and Religion (DfCDR), were supported through the Australia-PNG Law and Justice Partnership.
Their success coincides with the recent recognition of sign language as PNG’s fourth official language, underscoring the need for skilled interpreters.
Anna described the milestone as “recognition, empowerment, and progress,” while DfCDR prepares a National Sign Language Implementation Plan (2025–2030) to build a certified interpreter registry and integrate training into mainstream services.
This move positions PNG as a Pacific leader in disability inclusion and rights-based justice reform."
NIP & Dei by-elections set,30/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6245,"By-elections for the New Ireland Provincial and Dei Open seats are ready to go with funds already released.
Electoral Commissioner Simon Sinai says writs for these by-elections should be issued towards the end of the year or early next year.

However, the court in July upheld the National Court’s decision to conduct a by-election."
NEA Launches Renewable Energy Policies,30/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6240,"The National Energy Authority (NEA) today launched five new policies to guide the use of renewable energy in Papua New Guinea. The policies cover solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and bioenergy.
NEA says these policies will provide a clear pathway for investors, communities, and government to work together in building a cleaner and more reliable energy future.
NEA Managing Director, Ronald Mekeya said the policies will be put into action to modernize infrastructure, improve energy systems, and use PNG’s natural resources more effectively.
“These policies are frameworks to unlock our resources responsibly, strengthen energy security, and turn natural abundance into lasting prosperity,” he said.
Solar Energy
PNG has year-round sunshine. The solar policy aims to deliver electricity to both urban centers and rural communities. It will help households, small businesses, and reduce reliance on costly diesel power.
Wind Energy
Coastal and highland areas have untapped wind resources. The wind policy will encourage investment in wind projects, creating a stable and diverse energy supply.
Hydro Energy
Hydropower has been a main source of electricity in PNG. The hydro policy supports new investments in river-based power and encourages mini-hydro projects in both urban and rural areas.
Geothermal Energy
With PNG located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, geothermal power offers a strong and reliable energy source. The geothermal policy sets out how this potential will be developed responsibly for long-term national benefit.
Bioenergy
PNG’s agriculture sector produces large amounts of organic waste. The bioenergy policy will promote the conversion of waste into energy, creating new industries and jobs, especially in rural areas.
Together, the five policies form the foundation of PNG’s renewable energy future. NEA says they will help cut costs, reduce pollution, and create a stable energy sector that supports the country’s growth."

Gold smugglers still at large,29/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6231,"PNG Customs is looking for two Persons of Interest involved in the attempted illegal smuggling of 22.2kg of gold out of Jacksons International Airport recently.
Assistant Commissioner of Customs, enforcement unit, Ian Hering, revealed this during the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery in Port Moresby yesterday.
The attempted illegal smuggling of 22.2 kg of gold out of Jacksons International Airport in Papua New Guinea is a significant incident that highlights the challenges faced by customs and law enforcement agencies in combating smuggling and other illicit activities.
The fact that PNG Customs is actively seeking two Persons of Interest indicates a robust investigative response to tackle this issue.
Mr Hering’s revelation during the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery highlights the seriousness of the situation and the need for improved enforcement mechanisms in the country's customs and immigration frameworks.
He said illegal smuggling of gold not only has financial implications but also raises concerns about compliance with international regulations regarding the movement of precious metals.
Mr Hering told the Committee that Customs officers were only restricted to certain areas of the Jacksons International airport while the National Airports Corporation takes full responsibility of the facility.
Lack of holding cells to detain suspects is also a challenge that affects the task of Customs officers.
These revelations shocked the Committee members. The involvement of customs authorities also calls for greater cooperation with other law enforcement agencies to ensure that all aspects of the smuggling attempt are investigated, including the network of individuals and potential criminal organizations involved.
“There is a syndicate operating at the airport. We need to tighten the scanning from the entrance until a passenger exits so we can do the full detection on that particular passenger,” Mr Hering told the Committee.
The involvement of customs authorities also calls for greater cooperation with other law enforcement agencies to ensure that all aspects of the smuggling attempt are investigated, including the network of individuals and potential criminal organizations involved.
Additionally, this situation may prompt discussions about enhancing training for customs officers and implementing advanced technology to improve detection and monitoring at airports and other entry points.
Interestingly enough, 22.2kg of gold and passports of the two foreigners were seized, but both men are missing from the Bomana Immigration Detention Centre."
PNG to be grey-listed in February 2026,29/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6230,"Papua New Guinea is set to be greylisted in February 2026 due to issues in its financial systems and regulatory frameworks is a serious matter.
Central Bank’s Financial Analysis and Supervision Unit (FASU) Director, Wilson Onea, revealed this today during the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery hearing in Port Moresby.
Being placed on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) greylist can have significant ramifications for a country, including increased scrutiny from international financial institutions and potential challenges in attracting foreign investment.
Mr Onea’s revelation during the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery highlights the urgent need for reforms to enhance the country’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing measures.
Greylisting usually indicates that a country has deficiencies in its compliance with international standards, which can lead to higher costs for transactions and difficulties for businesses operating in or trading with PNG.
The government will need to take proactive steps to address the underlying issues that led to this impending greylisting.
Actions may include strengthening regulatory frameworks, enhancing the capacity of related institutions, conducting comprehensive risk assessments, and fostering transparency in financial transactions.
Moreover, engaging with international partners to improve compliance measures and adherence to global standards will be critical.
The consequences of greylisting also extend to public perception, potentially affecting tourism and foreign investment.
Therefore, Papua New Guinea must prioritize reforms in its financial and regulatory landscape to mitigate the impacts of greylisting and work towards regaining a stable standing in the international financial community."

MV IBK is named after three key local-level government areas in Gulf Province: Ihu, Baimuru, and Kikori.
The vessel was purchased in July 2025 by the Kikori District Development Authority (DDA) to address critical transport needs across the district, especially between Port Moresby, Kerema, Ihu, Baimuru, and Kikori.
Member for Kikori and Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, Soroi Eoe, who was accompanied by his staff and security personnel, as well as the crew members of the landing craft.
He stated, “I'm excited, it is the only way we can deliver to our people,"" Minister Soroi said.
Despite the bad weather, MV IBK arrived safely in Ihu on Friday, September 26. On board the barge were building materials that were delivered to Marea United Church.
The church plays a vital role not only in spreading the Gospel but also in housing and assisting People Living with Disability.
The building materials will be used to improve their facilities.
Getting assistance was also the Ihu High School, after being hard hit with food shortages in term 3. The rations come on time for boarding students and especially for grade 10s, who sit their exams in a few weeks.
Eoe said delivery of projects to Ihu, Baimuru, and Kikori had been a costly exercise for the Kikori District Development Authority over the years. Small dinghy vessels are hired to transport materials for project developments. As a result, project developments are quite slow
He said the road connection is only on the east side of the Gulf province, while the west part of the province is accessed by air and water. And MV IBK will operate as a passenger ship and, at the same time, help in the delivery of projects.
""One of the sad parts of life is that most of our people have lost their lives at sea.  “In this way, we can provide relief to our people. They can come as a passenger and bring their family from wherever they are.

“In fact, 14 years after independence in 1975, Bougainville Island in our country suffered extreme violence. But through dialogue and the oversight of the United Nations, we've achieved the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement. And since then, I am happy to say not a bullet has been fired since the peace agreement was signed.
“We continue to resolve questions around Bougainville's future through dialogue, our Melanesian conscience, our Christian brotherhood sitting together on the table, and through our consensual process. I want to say Bougainville reminds us that peace can be achieved.”
He made particular mention of the Israel Gaza conflict, pledging PNG’s allegiance to Israel and calling on Gaza to come to the “peace table”.
“This morning I was pleased to hear Israel's Prime Minister saying for the first time, or in fact he's been saying with re-emphasis again this morning, that Hamas, if you let go (of) those who you capture, they could stop the war right now and then.
“And for Papua New Guinea as a friend of Israel, I want to say we will stand on Israel's word and ask them to come to the peace table if Hamas, you come out and stop the current war that is going on. Give peace a go,” Marape said.
The Prime Minister also reminded other nations in conflict that peace can be reached and PNG stands as a testimony to this process.
“And I want to ask, give peace a go, sit at the table of peace. That could be something that the world can learn from Papua New Guinea. After 10 years of civil conflict, we decided under UN supervision that we will give peace a go.

High management turnover at SOEs a concern,27/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6199,"High staff turnover in the executive management of State-Owned Enterprises is contributing to the problems faced by SOEs like PNG Power and Water PNG, says NCD Governor Powes Parkop.
He made this comment on Thursday 25th September when addressing stakeholders from government departments, state-owned agencies as well as the private sector, during a gathering to find solutions to the ongoing power issues not just in Port Moresby but around the country as well.
Secretary for National Planning and Monitoring, Koney Samuel emphasized that for the country to achieve the goals of Vision 2050, there must be a sustainable energy system in the country.
“I don’t think we have put a lot of money into the energy sector and I think the coordination is very, very important and I can’t see any numbers here in terms of the issues that you have presented and what would be the cost of addressing those issues in the country and I’d been making some statements to restructure the budget. I think we have to put K1 billion in energy sector!
“The government must borrow but grant to PPL because PPL does not have capacity to repay the loan at this point in time. I think the government must take the leadership and provide some sufficient funding.”
He emphasized on a K1billion budget even if it means knocking on international lenders again, adding that ADB is willing to come on board as well as World Bank, JICA and other external sources.
NCD Governor Parkop highlighted the lack of stable governance as a contributing factor to the problems faced, noting the change of the PPL CEO 14 times since 2012. He urged decision makers to stop this kind of practice.
“If we keep high staff turnover at PNG Power and Water PNG how do we expect this strategic plan to be devised and for us to implement this plan?
“In PNG Power, I want to encourage you all to put a time line where we are going to get rid of all the back-up generators. If we can put a timeline to it and work towards it, that would be good for the city and good for Papua New Guinea.” Parkop said.
He said business houses must not be distracted by their standby generators. They must concentrate on their core business of making money and growing the economy and leave the energy issue to PNG Power Limited.
He suggested a timeline of 2027 for all major entities and business houses to stop using back-up generators."
Parties overlooked education calendar,26/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6193,"A simple oversight by the Electoral Commission to consult the calendars of the different government departments to ensure elections do not fall on department sanctioned dates has now led to another delay of the 2025 LLG elections.
Despite being well prepared to go for polling tomorrow, the Electoral Commission has taken responsibility for its oversight in not consulting the education calendar before locking in the dates for LLG elections. He explained how the whole process would have been still delayed even if they had factored the exams into the schedule.
“I would like to admit that we overlooked the exam period that consistently have had over years, past and today. There is no excuse about it. So, when you look at it, presidents, councillors and supporters and everybody, public servants, our own staff on the ground, if we would have run the elections last time, it would be still the same. October would have been omitted. I have now come to realize. In previous elections, we never extend, so I never went down to October. We deliver and return in July.
“So, the education department going to exams and all of this was a normal thing. Now, it clashes with the election date and this time I was surprised. So, without knowing the exam time and we already set the date, now the education minister comes up and says the exam time is here,” Electoral Commissioner Simon Sinai explained.
However he reaffirmed EC’s commitment to this constitutional process and confirmed the start of the new polling date for 25 October 2025.
Having deferred LLG elections more than once, the Electoral Commission and the Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs were ready to go out and start polling tomorrow.
However, the decision to delay this constitutional process was done considering the national exams.
He urged everyone, especially the candidates to remain steadfast and resilient.
“So we wish to appeal to our people, the contestants and the election staff, appointed returning officers, assistant returning officers, polling clerks, team members, provincial administration, administrators, deputy administrators, advisors, women groups and youth groups who are involved one way or the other from election activity from day one to today, our apology.
“We apologize, may you accept our apology and cooperate to work together.”
And while polling is further delayed, Sinai also expressed concerns about remote areas where polling materials and staff have already been deployed but might not have received news of the deferral.
He said with writs already issued, there would not be any implications if they went ahead with polling.
“To the rest of Papua New Guinea, our teams were ready. You see, we don't have all our senior staff here. They are already in Tari, they are in Madang, they are in New Island, they are in Rabaul, Manus, everywhere already.
“We got the money out of the banks already and some remote parts they already left. Today, they might not know this and they already would be doing polling tomorrow or on Monday.
“If they do polling, we're still within the law, let them do it. But obviously, with respect to the exams, we will delay the election.”
The new dates for this election will be announced in the next few days."
HWPL 11th World Peace Summit,26/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6188,"Showcasing Achievements and Future Vision of Cooperation among International Organizations, Governments, and Civil Society for Peace, Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL), an international peace NGO based in South Korea, hosted the 11th Anniversary of the September 18th HWPL World Peace Summit on September 18–19 in Cheongju.
Under the theme “Uniting for Peace and Fulfilling Humanity’s Duty Together,” the commemoration will continue across 78 major cities worldwide through October.
This year’s summit gathered more than 800 global leaders, including former and current presidents, prime ministers, speakers of parliament, chief justices, cabinet ministers, and leaders in education, religion, media, and youth sectors, who voluntarily traveled to Korea, demonstrating expanding global support for HWPL’s peace initiatives.
Since the inaugural HWPL World Peace Summit in 2014, the organization has pledged practical approaches for conflict resolution through international law, interfaith cooperation, and peace education.
At this 11th anniversary, HWPL presented its key achievements from the past year, notably the development of public–private partnership models for embedding sustainable peace within diverse national contexts.
A central agenda item was the global expansion of support for the Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW), HWPL’s proposed legal framework to end wars and establish lasting peace. The DPCW sets out principles such as the prohibition of the use of force, conflict prevention and mediation, and ensuring sustainable peace.
Chairman Lee Manhee of HWPL emphasized global cooperation for peace, saying, ""Conflict can never be good. Only the achievement of peace is truly good. If we fail to establish a peaceful world in our time, we will burden future generations with conflict. What we leave behind must be a world of peace, not one of conflict.""
While the Cheongju summit served as the centerpiece, HWPL emphasized that anniversary events will continue in 78 countries through October.
More than 15,000 leaders from international organizations, governments, and civil society are expected to participate in in-depth discussions on long-term strategies for sustainable peace, tailored to their respective national contexts.
Since 2023, the HWPL International Religious Peace Academy has been implemented as an interfaith learning program, formally recognized in several countries as a platform for leaders and citizens to engage in peace-centered dialogue."

The Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government, Soroi Eoe, confirmed the change of date late this afternoon.
This change comes into place considering the National Examinations for Grades 8, 10, and 12, scheduled for October 6 to 24. This overlap posed a significant challenge.
Minister Eoe, in a statement, said the government's commitment to safeguarding the future of Papua New Guinea’s children by prioritizing their education during a critical national period.
A consensus was reached to retain the national examination dates as planned, while deferring the LLG polling to a later date.
Minister Eoe extended his gratitude to Deputy Prime Minister and Member for Lae, John Rosso, for his tireless consultations with key electoral stakeholders this week to address growing concerns about the potential disruption the upcoming LLG elections could pose to students sitting for national exams.
“As a government, we carry the dual responsibility of upholding the integrity of our elections while ensuring our children’s education is not compromised,” Minister Eoe stated. “Our young people are not just students—they are the future of this nation, and their exams must proceed without interference.”
Minister Eoe apologies to provincial administrations, candidates, and citizens who have worked diligently in preparation for the elections, acknowledging their efforts and sacrifices.
“The Electoral Commission is fully prepared to conduct polling, but we must first honour our duty to the next generation,” he said. “We cannot afford to jeopardise the future of our children.”
He assured the public that the elections will not face further delays and confirmed that polling will commence on 25 October.
Minister Eoe also thanked the Electoral Commissioner for exercising his constitutional authority to delay polling to protect the integrity of the national exams and uphold the interests of the country’s youth."
PPL told to fix aging blackouts,25/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6185,"As the country marked 50 years of Independence on September 16, most parts of the city were in the dark as power blackouts hit again, affecting city residents and vital services.
The power supply issue in the nation's capital is a never-ending story. The experience of last week has brought PNG Power Ltd (PPL) into the spotlight.
Today, in a meeting with PPL management, NCD Governor Powes Parkop told PPL to take action and resolve the prolonged blackout during the 50th Independence anniversary celebrations, the past and ongoing power crisis.
Parkop called an urgent meeting with leaders from the government and corporate sectors for an impromptu consultation to find solutions and end PPL’s power supply issues once and for all.
They expressed concern about the unacceptable norm of constant blackout both in Port Moresby and around the country.
Parkop said constant power blackouts have affected businesses, hospital operations, police operations, and other important operations.
“We all know that our country can’t go forward and cannot progress without these basic services. Government department needs it, businesses, and health need a reliable power supply to use their digital and AI technology for advancements. You cannot harness those without an affordable and reliable power supply,” Parkop said.
Several prominent people who participated in the discussions included senior members of NCDC, Department of Planning and Monitoring, Department of Personnel Management, Water PNG, Police, Port Moresby General Hospital, and the Department of Education.
Secretary for National Planning and Monitoring, Koney Samuel, firmly said that this problem faced by PPL is an ongoing issue over the years and needs to be resolved once and for all. He said there are funds to attempt solutions, either temporary or permanent.
Samuel urged the PPL management to seek assistance from the government to address this issue.
PNG Power Ltd chief executive officer, Paul Bayly, explained the issues that PNG Power is currently facing, which are causing the constant blackouts.
PPL says one contributing factor is the lack of water supply due to the long dry spell in the city. It highlighted that its critical power transformer breakdown also caused power interruptions. Bayly alluded to the fact that there are legacy issues that need to be resolved."
Marape commends PNG Customs for confiscating undeclared cigarettes,25/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6181,"Prime Minister James Marape has commended the Papua New Guinea Customs Service (PNGCS) for its tireless efforts in safeguarding Papua New Guinea’s borders and making significant breakthroughs in the fight against Illicit Trade.
This follows the recent seizure of 3.5 million undeclared cigarette sticks, with an estimated street value of K3.54 million, at the Motukea Container Examination Facility (CEF) in July.
The illicit consignment was cleverly concealed in boxes falsely declared as ‘tissues’ but was detected through the vigilance and expertise of Customs officers, working in close collaboration with the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
The Prime Minister described the operation as a clear reflection of the progress PNGCS has made in reducing Illicit Tobacco and protecting the well-being of Papua New Guineans.
“I want to commend Chief Commissioner David Towe for his outstanding leadership and every hardworking officer of the Papua New Guinea Customs Service for their dedication. This successful seizure is not only a victory against smugglers but also a powerful reminder that PNG will not be a haven for Illicit Trade,” Marape said.
The Prime Minister also highlighted the broader economic and social impact of PNGCS’ enforcement efforts.
“By intercepting Illicit Tobacco, Customs is protecting the health of our people, ensuring Government revenue is safeguarded, and enabling legitimate businesses to thrive. Every stick of Illicit Tobacco taken off our streets is a win for our nation,” he said.
Independent studies previously showed that Illicit Tobacco accounted for between 36 to 40 percent of the PNG market in 2018–2019.
However, thanks to consistent enforcement and collaboration between Customs, Treasury, law enforcement agencies, and industry stakeholders, the market share of Illicit Tobacco dropped to less than 6 percent by 2023, with continued efforts being made till date to bring it even further down."
LLG polling deferred to October 25,25/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6173,"Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Constitutional Matters, Richard Masere, this morning told this newsroom that an official statement on the outcome of the Local Level Government elections will come from the Acting Prime Minister, John Rosso, and Minister for Education, Lucas Dekena.
According to a statement circulating on social media, the Government has resolved to address the date clashes between the Local Level Government (LLG) election polling and the National Examination schedule.
Leaders on Government forums raised concerns regarding the overlap between these two important national events.
The statement indicated that two separate meetings were convened, attended by the Acting Prime Minister, Minister for Education, Minister for Police, Minister for Administrative Services, and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Constitutional Matters, the Chief Secretary, State Solicitor, and the Electoral Commissioner.
The LLG polling and counting were initially set for September 27 to October 17, while the National Examinations for Grades 8, 10, and 12 were scheduled for October 6 to 24. This overlap posed a significant challenge.
After careful deliberation, the Government resolved that while the LLG elections are a vital constitutional process, the education of our children must take precedence.
Any deferral of national examinations would create a ripple effect on marking, selection processes and admissions into higher learning institutions, directly affecting the future of students.
A consensus was reached to retain the national examination dates as planned, while deferring the LLG polling to October 25, 2025.
The Electoral Commissioner will shortly announce the revised polling, counting, and return-of-writs dates.
This decision was made in the best interest of ensuring that both the examinations and the elections proceed smoothly and successfully. Official statements from the Acting Prime Minister and the Minister for Education will follow.
Confirmed National Examination Dates:
Grade 10: October 6-10
Grade 12: October 13 – 17
Grade 8: October 20 – 24"
Sonk withdraws court proceedings,25/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6169,"The Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) Board today welcomed the withdrawal of two applications before the courts, allowing them to proceed unhindered in their assigned roles, responsibilities, and decisions as noted in their instrument of appointment.
They also extended thanks to suspended KPHL Managing Director Wapu Sonk and his lawyers for taking this course of action of withdrawing the court proceedings filed last Friday and on Sunday.
Mr Sonk filed two applications - the Friday one challenging the appointment of the new KPHL Board and the Sunday one challenging his suspension as KPHL Managing Director.
Board Chairman Gerea Aopi said, ""The Board resolution to suspend Mr Sonk as KPHL Managing Director and appoint Luke Liria as acting MD was not malicious in intent but administrative: to ensure integrity of process both for KPHL in ensuring good governance principle of transparency and accountability; and for Mr Sonk as he addresses his personal issues.""
""Justice as we all know, must not only be done, but seen to be done, both in KPHL's case as PNG's leading multi-billion State company involved in oil and gas sector in PNG and abroad; and in the case of Mr Sonk as the pioneer and leading chief executive of KPHL over allegations of impropriety published initially in the Australian press.""
Aopi said whatever perceptions and public opinion may be, only courts of law can ascertain guilt or otherwise. He added that Mr Sonk is therefore innocent as far as the law and the Board are concerned.
The withdrawal of the applications by agreement, endorsed by the courts today, effectively means a halt to the challenges on the appointment of the current KPHL Board led by Chairman Aopi; and the Board's unanimous decision on suspension of Mr Sonk as Managing Director and Luke Liria as Acting Managing Director.
""To expedite the removal of this cloud hanging over KPHL and Mr Sonk, what really needs to happen is for an independent investigation and necessary court action on the alleged matters now in the public. Any court challenges in relation to the appointment of the new KPHL Board of Directors will only result in unnecessary delays and accumulated legal fees while the substantive matter of the allegations remains unresolved,” Aopi added."

""The destruction of critical infrastructure, such as a major roadway, to compel government action is an act of terrorism,"" Commissioner Manning stated.

""Calm was promptly restored over the weekend, and the highway was repaired. Those who sought to hold the nation to ransom are now the subject of ongoing counter-terrorism operations.
""The second phase of the operation is being implemented to address any remaining threats in this region.
""I have authorised the use of measures available under the Counter-Terrorism Act, and approved counter-terrorism operations to remove this threat to our national security.
""200 law enforcement personnel are deploying in Nipa-Kutubu and adjoining areas.
""These personnel are afforded the powers and protections of the Counter-Terrorism Act to undertake their duties, and do so with the full support of the Government.

""These targeted operations not only address those responsible for these acts of terrorism, but also form part of our operations to provide a secure environment for our communities ahead of the 2027 National General Elections.
""This is part of a long-term commitment by Police and PNGDF to remove from our communities those who present a threat to the rule of law. This operation will continue over the coming months.""
The Commissioner commended the rapid response of security personnel to restore normality to the Nipa-Kutubu region.
""Our uniformed frontline members are to be commended for promptly resolving the immediate issue and ensuring the reopening of the Highway.
""However, now is the time for targeted operations to be implemented against those who sought to terrorise and hold to ransom our nation, and those who supported such acts."

The communities in Lae have been applauded for working together to ensure the city is safe, especially during the Morobe Show and Independence celebrations.
Lae city was a hive of activities leading up to PNG’s commemoration of its 50th Independence anniversary on September 16th.

“I say thank you to you all. Continue doing the right thing.

Schnaubelt pushes for additional electorate,23/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6148,"The long-awaited push for the creation of the proposed Konos Open seat in the Sentral Niu Ailan Local Level Government (LLG) of Namatanai District is now before the National Executive Council (NEC) for review.
Namatanai MP and provincial member Walter Schnaubelt announced at a recent gathering in Konos, where excitement is building among the people.
“I am pleased to inform you that the Konos Open agenda is now officially before the NEC for consideration. This is a significant milestone, and I want to assure you that New Ireland has already met the requirements in terms of population size, landmass, and administrative capacity to qualify for its own open electorate,” Schnaubelt said.
He commended the Provincial Boundaries Committee for successfully delivering the proposal and ensuring all necessary documentation is in place. Schnaubelt confirmed that the NEC submission has been completed and is undergoing the vetting process before it is tabled for deliberation.
“I will do everything within my power and capacity to ensure Konos Open becomes a reality. I will actively engage my contacts and colleagues in the NEC to support this cause. Importantly, I enjoy very good working relationships with the responsible Ministers, Soroi Eoe - Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, and Richard Masere - Minister for Administrative Services, and I intend to utilize that to advance our agenda,” he said.
While optimistic, the Governor reminded the people that the matter must follow proper legal and constitutional processes, which takes time and called for patience and unity as the review progresses.
“Ultimately, our goal is to have Konos Open established before the 2027 General Elections. While this is the ideal outcome, we must also be realistic that the process may take longer. Regardless, I assure you that I will not give up until Konos Open becomes a reality,” he declared.
The proposed electorate would encompass Ramat to Bol on the east coast, Naiama to Kokola on the west coast, and the Tabar Islands within the Sentral Niu Ailan LLG. It would include the proposed Central East, Central West, and Tabar Group of Islands LLGs.
Konos is already well established with its own administration and council, and boasts existing facilities ready to serve as the foundation of a new electorate.
The Sentral Niu Ailan Rural LLG, with its headquarters in Konos, is the largest in Namatanai District, comprising 22 wards and an estimated population of 45,000—a strong and deserving candidate for parliamentary representation.
“This is not a political agenda of mine; this is about giving proper representation to the people of central New Ireland. Together, let’s remain patient, stay united, and trust the process,” Schnaubelt concluded."

"Refrain from committing crime, warns Manning",23/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6146,"Committing a criminal offense is not the way we want to live our 50 years of independence; rather, abiding by the laws of our country is what we want to achieve, says Commissioner David Manning.
He made this statement in response to an illegal protest conducted by the community of Nipa, Southern Highlands Province, following the recent suspension of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Managing Director Wapo Sonk.
Commissioner Manning described the illegal protest as unlawful. He said the country has celebrated its 50 years of independence, and committing criminal offences is not the way the country should head.
“At some point, we have to realise that to live in a just, safe, and secure society, all of us need to be law-abiding citizens. There is no secret formula to it,” he said.
Manning said there are avenues to seek justice; taking matters into our own hands will not solve a problem.
He warned communities, especially in the Highlands region, that the Royal PNG Constabulary will not take matters lightly; it will rather use excessive force if citizens do not abide by the laws.
Meanwhile, the deployment of mobile squad units and members of the PNG Defence Force to Nipa has stopped the illegal protest from further escalating."

""As the largest Pacific Island Police Force, it was recognised that PNG provides significant input into regional security and combating cross-border crime,"" Commissioner Manning confirmed.
""Papua New Guinea's priority is to harness the power of regional collaboration to meet criminal threats to our communities.
""This increased engagement will enhance our capacity to intercept international criminals trying to exploit our country, while providing valuable input to Asia-Pacific law enforcement.
""The increased trafficking of drugs and weapons, and the laundering of money, poses a significant threat to the safety of communities across the Pacific and Asia.
""The fight against cyber-enabled child exploitation and other online criminal activity is another rising threat to our people.
""Papua New Guinea stands as the bridge between Asia and the Pacific, uniquely positioned to foster deeper, enhanced regional policing cooperation to target these criminals.""
Commissioner Manning said Assistant Commissioner of Police, Hodges Ette, will represent Papua New Guinea on this important INTERPOL committee.
""ACP Ette will represent PNG well at this high-level INTERPOL forum, and carry the respect of his international peers.""
""With many years of experience in front-line policing, ACP Ette has commanded complex investigations into transnational narcotic syndicates, money laundering, and child exploitation.""

Papua New Guinea is joined on the INTERPOL Asian Region Committee by Fiji, Australia, China, India, United Arab Emirates, Korea and the Philippines.

Health Workers Trained on Grievance Mechanism,22/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6138,"As Papua New Guinea prepared for Independence celebrations, health workers in East New Britain were also working towards strengthening community trust in health services.
More than 20 district health officers and facility managers in Kokopo attended a training on environmental and social safeguards, with a focus on establishing grievance redress mechanisms (GRM).
The workshop, conducted by the National Department of Health through the World Bank-funded IMPACT Health Project, aimed to equip health workers with tools to manage patient complaints and conflicts.
Led by IMPACT Health Project’s Environment and Social Safeguards Specialist, Martha Ginau, the sessions encouraged participants to share real experiences of conflicts and explore practical systems to address them.
Many participants expressed interest in setting up patient feedback tools, such as suggestion and complaint boxes, to improve accountability and communication.
The training followed a separate polio workshop held earlier in the week and is part of broader efforts under the IMPACT Health Project to ensure health workers and facilities meet global safeguards standards.
East New Britain participants now join over 100 health workers in East Sepik, Central, and Chimbu who have undergone similar training, with some facilities already implementing feedback systems.
By organising ways for patients to raise concerns, the project hopes to strengthen trust, improve service delivery, and ensure patients feel understood and cared for."

"Safer seas, bigger catches",22/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6132,"Fishing families in East Sepik Province no longer have to endure long and costly trips to sea, thanks to a new initiative by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) under the EU-STREIT PNG Programme.
Seven inshore Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) have been deployed across seven fishing communities in Wewak District, directly benefitting more than 1,500 households and a combined population of about 9,000 people.
The FADs bring fishing grounds closer to the shore, reducing fuel costs, cutting travel times, and increasing catch rates—all while protecting fragile reef ecosystems.
On Wallis Island, the Fongkeleh Catches Business Group, made up of 150 members, including women, has already seen significant improvements.
Chairperson Sakias Nimehendu shared, “Our challenge when we didn’t have a FAD was that we troll for hours, wasting petrol, and sometimes returning with only 3 to 5 fish. Now, my catch has increased to over 100 fish for every fishing trip, and it takes less time.”
The initiative is part of FAO’s push to strengthen food security and livelihoods in island and coastal communities. Fisherfolk received training on sustainable FAD use, vessel safety, emergency procedures, and community-led monitoring to ensure long-term benefits.
Women, who play a central role in processing and selling fish, are also benefitting from shorter fishing times, giving them more time for both household and income-generating activities.
FAO Fisheries Officer Job Opu said the project was tailored to the needs of the communities themselves, ensuring easier access for small canoes. More FADs will be deployed across East and West Sepik in the coming weeks as the program continues."

The AI tool, installed on a portable MinXray system, generates a TB risk score within seconds. Healthcare workers responsible for treating patients can review images and make informed decisions quickly.
Since acquiring the portable MinXray system with the (QureAI) AI tool installed in 2024, the investment has enabled the deployment of AI-assisted TB screening directly into POMGEN’s Maternity Wing, Radiology Department, and TB clinics.
The Australian Government is proud to be working alongside other initiatives that improve early detection, reduce diagnostic delays, and strengthen local capacity to combat TB."

PNG National Reset Convergence,19/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6098,"A powerful, spirit-filled prayer convention entitled as “PNG National Reset Convergence” started Wednesday September 17, 2025 at the Reverend Sioni Kami Memorial Church (RSKMC) in Port Moresby. The Body of Christ with Chairman, Reverend Pastor Joseph Walters, invited prophets and apostles from Africa and the United States to pray over the land, and teach the church to take on the responsibility of healing the land and resetting the country for the next decade.

Walters. “For example, apostle Julius Suubi just talked about the importance of prayer and breaking curses on our land and in our families and then prophet Cindy Jacob very much said the same thing.”
“There was a lot of prayers today believing that those words clearly from God, from the man and woman of God and our responses will start to affect the nation for the better.”
According to Rev. Walters the convergence was part of a longtime plan of the Body of Christ that started in 2024. It was to be part of this year’s 50th anniversary celebrations among several important leadup events.
Rev. Joseph Walters said this is the main event, which they refer to as, ‘’The National Reset Convergence’.
“We are believing as the people who pray and trust God, that our nation will change after 16th September we believe that our nation will have some changes and adjustments, rearrangements, for our nation and believe God for a new Papua New Guinea,” said Rev. Walters.
Thousands of prayer network members came from around the county and nearby Pacific Island countries to receive healing and deliverance. Through their teaching, both Apostle Julius and Prophet Cindy revealed some of the reasons why there is poverty, disease and lack of advancement in the country.
While sharing an experience on how several African countries were delivered and changed their status quo to prosperity, Prophet Cindy explained that they were led to deal with iniquities from the past before deliverance could take place in their individual lives as well as their families, tribes and the countries they belong to. She said their leaders have to take some major initiatives in order to cause the deliverance to begin.
The National Reset convergence ends Sunday evening September 21, with a crusade. The Body of Christ leaders are grateful for the presence of PM Marape on the opening night and hope to have him again on or before the closing night."

Taking a stand for referees,17/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6083,"Queensland Rugby League continues to work closely with the Papua New Guinea Rugby Football League (PNGRFL), thanks to the ongoing partnership of PacificAus Sports, participating in a series of meetings in Port Moresby.
PacificAus Sports is an Australian Government sports diplomacy initiative creating opportunities for Pacific athletes, coaches, officials, and administrators to learn, grow, train, and play together.
As Papua New Guinea marks 50 years of independence, QRL’s General Manager of Community Rugby League, Adam Vanzanten, and Financial Controller, Aidan Wade, led discussions focused on building a game for the country’s next generation. It was sport diplomacy in action: positive relations delivering practical outcomes.
Both organisations have common challenges and complementary strengths. PNG’s community connection is extraordinary. Queensland’s club frameworks and volunteer systems are proven and ready to share. The commitment is to share knowledge openly, exchange what works, adapt it locally and measure results where the game is actually played and watched.
A clear priority emerged around match officials. Instead of ignoring the issue, both bodies agreed to lead on respect for referees because it is the foundation for a safe and enjoyable game.
The approach is optimistic and solutions-driven: set the standard, make it visible, and support officials so they stay.
Queensland’s measures are already in place and producing change. Under-18 referees wear green socks so crowds and team staff recognise they are minors. A respect round with reports of incidents dropping by about a third.
Ground managers in red vests having the authority to issue warnings or stop play when behaviour crosses the line. Public address announcements make it clear that poor spectator conduct brings club demerit points and potential suspension.
Most importantly coaches are accountable for the standard they set on the sideline, because their influence carries over to their team and their teams supporters.
Support continues beyond match day. QRL is building a full pathway for officials through referee coordinators and coach mentors, strong referee associations that provide voice and support, healthy match payments to attract new young referees, and regular courses that lift capability and confidence.
PNGRFL will follow suit by piloting a recruit, retain and plan model in selected districts, backed by shared templates and volunteer recruitment plans adapted from recent QRL workshops.
Next steps are defined and joint.
PNGRFL will implement referee support and match-day controls alongside coach education, while QRL provides ongoing guidance.
Behaviour and retention will be tracked together to refine and scale successful initiatives.
This is the power of diplomacy in rugby league: two neighbours comparing experiences, solving shared problems and setting a higher standard for officials and communities across the Pacific."

UniSocial treat for Independence,17/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6080,"During the 50th independence anniversary jubilee celebrations, it is not ‘all is well’ for every Papua New Guinean, because there are still pockets of people in dire need, even in the land of plenty; that’s what the members of the Universal Church in Papua New Guinea discovered.
On Saturday, September 13, at the main church on Gabaka Street, Gordons, the Universal Church held a UniSocial event to support those who felt left behind.
Many homeless people and those rejected by their families and society, who couldn’t afford a proper meal in a day, were invited to share a meal on that day.
Bishop Jonathan preached the word of God, encouraging those present that no matter what they had done in their lives, God has not forgotten them. He said it is not by coincidence that they are in church at the time; it was God’s appointed time for them.
“Jeremiah 29:11 says, ‘For I know the thoughts I think towards you, says the Lord. Thoughts of peace, and not of evil. To give you a future and a hope.’
Apart from the feed, Bibles were also distributed to those who wanted them. They received both the physical food as well as the Word of God, as this is the work of the Universal Church, following in the words of Jesus Christ, ‘to love God and to love our neighbour as well as love ourselves’.
Those who turned up included youths who live on the streets in Boroko and its surroundings.
On the occasion, the church was also graced by the presence of BSP personnel from the Waigani Call centre to provide vital banking advice and banking requirements to those who needed it.
The Universal Church will continue to be open this Independence Week, including the main Independence Church Service on Tuesday, September 16 where prayers of healing and deliverance will be ministered."
"A call for Unity, Renewal and Transformation",17/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6078,"Fifty years after Papua New Guinea’s national flag first rose on Independence Hill, thousands of citizens, leaders, and international partners gathered at the same sacred ground this morning to commemorate the nation’s Golden Jubilee.
Prime Minister James Marape has urged Papua New Guineans to embrace unity, honesty, and a renewed commitment to service as the nation steps into its next 50 years.
The event carried deep historical resonance. Independence Hill was once again the stage where the nation’s red, black, and gold flag — adorned with the bird of paradise and Southern Cross — was hoisted to the sound of the national anthem.
Joining the celebrations were His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, Pacific leaders, ambassadors, church dignitaries, and representatives of development partners. Members of the founding generation and families of past prime ministers were also present, visibly moved as the flag returned to the skies where they had first seen it raised in 1975.
For Prime Minister Marape, this moment was more than commemoration. It was, as he put it, “a time to reset our minds, our purposes, and our zeal” for the next era of national progress.
On stressing the birth of the nation, Prime Minister Marape paid tribute to the “Somare generation” led by Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, who, with his colleagues, navigated PNG into independence. He recognised Dr John Momis, Sir John Kaputin, Lady Veronica Somare, Lady Stella Chan, and families of other leaders who shaped the nation’s founding.
“Yet history shows Papua New Guineans never give up.”
“They were the greatest generation Papua New Guinea ever produced,” the Prime Minister said. “They dared to believe that a thousand tribes, speaking over 800 languages, could unite as one people, one nation, one country. Their achievement will never be repeated.”
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the role of missionaries, churches, and educators who laid the foundation for modern PNG.
“Papua New Guinea can claim its place as the last country on Earth to have received the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Since then, the church has been our moral anchor, shaping our education, health, and leadership systems,” he said.
He extended gratitude to Australia, describing the transition to independence as one rooted in respect and goodwill. He quoted Sir John Guise’s words of 1975: “We are lowering the Australian flag, not tearing it.”
Importantly, Prime Minister Marape saluted the “unsung heroes” of nationhood — public servants, teachers, health workers, police officers, defence personnel, and farmers. “You have served your flag well. You have honoured your Constitution. The last 50 years belong to you as much as to our leaders.”
The Prime Minister described PNG’s story since 1975 as a journey of resilience. Despite political instability in the first three decades, PNG preserved democracy while other nations faltered. Over time, infrastructure was built, schools expanded, and citizens began to excel internationally."

New court complex restores confidence in justice system,13/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6045,"The opening of the new National and Supreme Court Complex this week is the pride of the country’s judiciary. It is a symbol of progress and instills confidence in the administration of justice, says the PNG Law Society.
Society president Hubert Namani said the new Court Complex must stand not only as a monument of progress, but as a mandate for justice. It must be a place where the Rule of Law is upheld without fear or favour, not only against the petty offender, but also against those who plunder the State, abuse public trust, and profit from impunity.
He said justice must not be selective; it must be firm, fair, and fearless.
Namani said 50 years ago, the challenges of corruption, poor governance, and lack of accountability remain, but the opening of the new courthouse serves as a reminder that these challenges can be managed.
“Our people continue to endure struggles that undermine the freedoms and rights enshrined in our Constitution. Violence and killings in parts of the country are tearing communities apart.
Sorcery-related violence, once thought to be confined to rural areas, has now reached Port Moresby, threatening to normalise barbaric acts at the heart of our nation. Without deterrence and the consistent enforcement of law, these atrocities will soon be at our very doorsteps.”
“Lawlessness, organised crime, and tribal fighting continue to escalate. At the same time, basic social services are collapsing under the weight of neglect. Our hospitals run out of medicine, our schools lack resources, and our young people are left without opportunities to contribute meaningfully to nation-building. These are not coincidences; they are the inevitable consequences of systemic failures and, above all, the cancer of corruption,” he said.
Namani reminded the legal practitioners that they are the guardians of justice; they must lead with confidence, integrity, accountability, and courage to rebuild confidence in the judiciary and restore hope. Ensuring that justice prevail and gives Papua New Guineans access to the rule of law."

During the canoes' stop at Siar village, the local Pastor Philip Takee of the ELC of St. Bergmann congregation retold to Katanabul Fishing Associations Darius Suari about the mission’s history and what had transpired back in 1899.
In 1899, Siar was the first mission station of ELC in Madang province, with missionary George Kunze heading the spread of the gospel within the province. Coincidentally in 1899, Kunze decided to travel the seas to the other side, to Karkar Island, to spread the Good News.
Kunze was accompanied by six clans from Waifun, Badalon, Lilung, Banablau, Mizimu, and Didfon of Siar village on two canoes, each containing six men. He landed on Patilo on October 19th and began his mission.
According to Ps. Takee, it is not by mistake that in the celebrations of the country’s 50th Golden Jubilee Independence Anniversary, canoes from Patilo village at Karkar Island followed the footsteps of their trade route but also carried back the word of the Lord as once missionary Kunze did. He acknowledged that this history was nearly forgotten, but thanks to the Katanabul Fishing Association, it has been reignited and retold to the current generation of Siar village.
On Friday, as the canoes bid farewell to long-tied relations of Siar village and thanked them for their hospitality, they looked back on how this memory would soon last for 50 more years to come. Not only have the stories come out to tell of their ancestral and marriage ties, they’ve also found the connection linking them through early missionary Kunze.

“In the modest houses, in rundown facilities, the judiciary was formed and preserved, and today this marks a starting point for the government of today and the government of the future to commit resources to maintaining the judiciary into the future,” he said.
Marape said PNG’s population has grown, leading to more complexity in court cases, of which the opening of the new courthouse is a step to addressing this issue.
Marape further thanked the past and current governments for investing in the judiciary, and called for more support for this important arm of government."

"Stories, legends and past connections",13/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6034,"As part of the Australian High Commission’s Yumi Stap Wantaim celebration of Papua New Guinea’s 50th Anniversary of Independence, we have brought together artists from the two nations for a special exhibition celebrating their deep ties.
‘The Invisible Line: Stories, Legends and Past Connections’ has opened at the Cairns Regional Council’s Mulgrave Gallery with an official launch on Friday, September 12, attended by Australia’s Assistant Minister for Pacific Island Affairs Senator the Nita Green, and Australia's Ambassador for First Nations People, Justin Mohamed.
Four PNG-based and four Australia-based artists have been working on the art project for the past six months, following workshops in Port Moresby held in March this year.
The Invisible Line highlights the ancestral and continued connections between PNG and Australia through art and stories.
These stories celebrate Australian First Nation and PNG cultures, as well as contemporary expression and PNG diaspora voices in Australia.
The multi-disciplinary artists taking part in the exhibition include Leonard Tebegetu (metal work), Gazellah Bruder (printmaking, painting and metal work), Pax Jukapa (painting), Morgan Lavapo (painting), Jimmy K Thaiday (sculpture, painting, print/etching), Charlie Street (painting and graphics), Wendy Mocke (multimedia, acting, writing), and Bernadette Killin (visual arts and educator).
Renowned PNG artist, Lesley Wengembo and acting curator of the Mulgrave Gallery in Cairns, Sally Brown, have curated the exhibition.
Mr Wengembo stated, “It’s so good to see all eight artists of both countries come together, especially the moment they all met during their visit in Port Moresby – it was almost like they all knew each other. This exchange has been the highlight of their creativity process, which is being displayed at the Mulgrave Gallery.”
Mrs Brown stated that visitors can look forward to experiencing the vibrant and authentic culture of Papua New Guinea, and behind every piece of art lies a story waiting to be discovered.
“The Invisible Line is an exhibition showcasing the rich tapestry of experiences from eight artists, each sharing their unique story through the lens of Papua New Guinea’s past and their hopes for the future,” Ms Brown added."
23 Karkar canoes on a mission,12/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6033,"The Karkar community of Patilo village, Madang province, is proud to participate in the upcoming 50th Golden Jubilee Independence celebrations. The island community recently set sail 23 canoes representing the 22 provinces, showcasing unity and one PNG.
The canoes are estimated to reach Madang town on Saturday, September 13. The route currently taken is a traditional canoe trade route. They have a purpose for this travel – to raise awareness against law-and-order issues through the word of God.
The 23 canoes departed Karkar Island on Saturday, September 6, destined for Madang’s provincial capital, to participate in the province’s main independence celebration.
The traveling party braved the braved the ghastly Southern Easterly winds. While some went off course, everyone regrouped on Sunday at Rempi Village and paddled on.
Battered and strained from the challenging weather conditions, they progressed to Riwo Village and and then Siar on Thursday.
Today, they descended on Krangket Island for a nightcap.
Tomorrow, they reach their destination, the Tusbab Beach.
These canoes relive the ancestral trade routes and at the same time are on a mission to spread the gospel to trading villages as they pass on.
Katanabul Fishing Association chairman, Darius Suari said his fishermen started this initiative as a way to showcase celebrations not only on land but at sea as well.
Suari hopes that their drama and sharing of the Lord’s word can infiltrate the youth’s minds during this festive season to change for the next 50 years on. It will also go down in history as one of the first of its kind in the country where the gospel travelled over miles from the island to reach the mainland.
It is anticipated that upon their arrival on the 13th at Tusbab beach, they will sell their canoes for their SME projects as fishermen. They rely solely on fish, and their challenge of self-sustainability and food security remains an issue that they struggle to meet.
Community leader of the island, Artis Deme, was steadfast in his support during the Association’s initiative to carve out canoes for the event, supporting them during the camping period. During the launch of the canoes, he advised young fishermen and other community youths to learn from this event and start changing their mindsets for a better island and province.
Deme challenged them to look beyond their challenges and learn as much as they can from ancestral history to survive the trying times. On the mainland, he also delivered rations for the paddlers when they stopped over at each location.
Karkar islanders voiced patriotism and will showcase unity as PNG celebrates 50 years of independence, despite the country’s many challenges."
Take care and celebrate safely: St John Ambulance,12/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6031,"As Papua New Guinea celebrates its 50th Independence Anniversary this week, the National St John Ambulance has issued a public safety advisory, warning that emergency incidents typically double during Independence celebrations.
Interim Chief Executive of St John, Dr Arabella Koliwan, congratulated the nation on reaching this historic milestone, calling it “a proud moment for every Papua New Guinean.”

“We remain dedicated to serving communities across our nation with courage and compassion, just as we have done for generations,” Dr Koliwan said.
Dr Koliwan emphasized that while Independence is a time of joy, it must also be a time of care.

Highlands Florists Bring Colour,12/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6026,"Florists from the Highlands are set to make their debut at the National Orchid and Flower Show in a vibrant celebration of Papua New Guinea’s floral heritage.
The event will take place over the weekend, September 13 - 14, in front of Parliament House.
This year’s National Orchid and Flower Show, now open to the public with free entry, features the newly unveiled Sir Rabbie L. Namaliu Orchid Gardens, a stunning display of orchids, Everlasting Daisies, and Bird of Paradise arrangements that honor both botanical beauty and national pride.
For the first time, florists from Eastern Highlands, Chimbu, Jiwaka, and Western Highlands will showcase their creations alongside seasoned growers from the nation’s capital. Their contributions include flower dresses, statues crafted entirely from blooms, and regionally distinct arrangements sourced from Mt Hagen and Mt Wilhelm.
Goroka, long known as PNG’s “flower town,” is at the heart of this movement. Local growers have built supply chains reaching Buka, Kimbe, and Port Moresby, turning floriculture into a viable small business sector. Many of the participating florists are single parents who rely on flower sales for income, demonstrating the economic potential of this often-overlooked industry.
Among the voices leading this floral renaissance is Ms. Keryn Hargreaves, whose personal journey with flowers began as a form of healing and grew into a passion for empowering others. “Flowers are more than decoration,” she says. “They’re a source of dignity, therapy, and livelihood.”
The Sir Rabbie L. Namaliu Orchid Gardens, named in honor of the late statesman, offer a serene backdrop for this showcase. Neatly arranged beds and decorative elements invite visitors to explore PNG’s botanical diversity while celebrating the legacy of a leader who valued national unity and cultural expression.
Organizers hope the event will inspire more Papua New Guineans to see floriculture not just as a hobby, but as a pathway to economic resilience and creative pride.
All orchid and plant admirers are welcome. Entry is free."

Mainge Clans Protect Land,11/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6014,"The Mainge Community in Melkoi LLG, Pomio District of East New Britain Province, has made history by launching its Sustainable Land Use Plan (SLUP) and signing a Conservation Deed on September 2, 2025.
Six landowning clans united in a symbolic ceremony to protect their customary land and natural resources after more than 15 years of environmental destruction from logging and palm oil projects. The Conservation Deed, a legally binding document, now ensures long-term protection of Mainge’s forests, rivers, and biodiversity.
Community Leader Leslie Alimba, who has led efforts to resist destructive development for years, said, “This move to protect the land is not for my personal interest and benefit, it’s for all the clans, all community members, and the future generations. As the theme says, my land is my life.
God created the environment, land and waters so we have to protect it. As a leader, I have to do everything for the good of my people.”
He added, “Today is historical for the survival of the future. We should not think about money and destroy our land. The money we receive today will be gone tomorrow and we will become slaves in our own land.”
FORCERT Manager, Cosmas Makamet, emphasized that Mainge’s land falls under the Special Agriculture and Business Lease (SABL), Portion 198c of the Nakiura Concession area. He explained, “Your land is under a SABL and with the signing today, you take a step towards reclaiming your customary land from the SABL. The Sustainable Land Use Plan, laws, penalties and the Conservation Deed signed today takes effect immediately to protect your land and environment.”
He warned that selling land for immediate profit jeopardizes the future: “If you sell your land, the money you received will vanish and your children and grandchildren will have no land to make gardens and build homes.”
World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Pomio Project Officer, Oscar Pileng, reinforced that the SLUP and Conservation Deed empower communities to sustainably plan and manage their land, not only for conservation but also for responsible development and economic opportunities.
Pomio District Electoral Officer, Chris Atung, commended the community’s resilience, while neighboring leaders from Atu, Mauna, and Kerengkorona Wards witnessed the event alongside FORCERT, WWF, and Wok Strongim Community Program Officers.
In a strong show of unity, both male and female representatives from each clan signed the Conservation Deed. The ceremony concluded with the joint unveiling of the SLUP by the Pomio District Electoral Officer and FORCERT Manager. Guests were later treated to fresh garden produce as a token of appreciation from the community."

Madang General Hospital a ‘Death Trap’,10/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6002,"President of the Papua New Guinea Nurses Association Frederick Kebai has described Madang General Hospital as a “death trap” after having a thorough tour of the institution last weekend.
Mr Kebai was in Madang with other PNGNA executives to conduct awareness about the new Nurses Savings and Loans Society and their new Insurance Scheme, but took the opportunity to visit the provincial hospital.
As a former student of the Lutheran School of Nursing and the hospital being his training ground, he was disappointed to see the deteriorating state of the hospital. Many facilities and infrastructure are run down with no improvements and staff are forced to work under stressful and under resourced circumstances.
He said Madang General Hospital is supposed to have a state-of-the-art facility as it is a teaching and referral hospital with so many qualified specialists.
Mr. Kebai stressed on the incomplete state of the Accidents and Emergency (A&E) ward where staff and patients have been wofrking inside a small enclosed building at the far end of the hospital.
Mr Kebai wants to see the hospital provide standard working conditions for the nurses in Madang province.
More concerning for Mr. Kebai was that the whole hospital had only one toilet working, posing a health risk for patients, guardians and the general staff as a whole.
As person in charge of nurses nationwide, he sympathized with Madang nurses and has called on the Provincial Health Authority, the Governor and members of each district in the province and the National Government to urgently look into the plight of the hospital."
PNG Nurses Association conducts product awareness in Madang,10/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6001,"The executives of the PNG Nurses Association were in Madang last week where they met with nurses at the Modilon General Hospital as part of the Associations roll out of awareness on the Nurses Savings and Loans Society and the nurses insurance policy program.
According to the Executives, this program has been rolled out in most parts of the country with the aim to inform members on how they can be part of this transformation.
Association president, Frederick Kebai urged them to take control of their finances, stating how loan sharks have been benefiting from many nurses throughout the country. He added that with the implementation of their own savings and loans society, they can all become members and liberate themselves from the strong grasp of loan sharks.
General Secretary Mulina Kwalimu reinforced Mr. Kebai’s speech stating that in time, many of them will be retired and their life after work must be in order financially to support them. With this opportunity of their savings and loans, nurses are encouraged to start mini-SME projects for financial stability after leaving the profession. Most nurses nationwide who have already registered are now enjoying the services of the society.
Insurance officer George Malega informed the nurses that they are still working on getting the insurance license and policies in place. However,  he is encouraged them to fully register under their insurance policies which will be tailored to meet their needs such as, hauskrai’s, funerals and medical services domestically and internationally upon referrals."

"Many reasons to celebrate, says ENB official",10/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5992,"Despite the challenges being faced in the country, there are still many reasons to celebrate Papua New Guinea’s 50th Independence anniversary.
East New Britain Provincial Administrator, Levi Mano, reminded the students of Tauran Primary School, in Toma LLG of Gazelle district, during the school’s pre-independence commemorative program last week.
“We are still a united country, free, with no wars and an abundance of food sources,” Mano stated.
“Other countries envy the freedom that we enjoy here.
“PNG has not only survived for 50 years, but it has also maintained its sovereignty as an independent state. It’s an achievement that the people should be proud of.”
Being a local of Viviran Ward, Mano said it was an honour to return and encourage his own community to celebrate this milestone with pride.
The school holds a special place in the country’s history as the alma mater of the late Grand Chief Sir Paulias Matane, former Governor General, whose final resting place is also at Viviran, next to Tauran Primary School.
Head Teacher of Tauran Primary, Edward Varpit, said it was fitting for a top provincial official to inspire the students and the community.
He explained that the pre-independence celebration is part of the curriculum and is assessed under the Expressive Arts strand.
“This event serves as a one-stop shop for many of our creative arts assessments. Today, classes are being assessed through traditional performances and the school pageant,” Mr. Varpit said.
He also acknowledged the contributions of past leaders, particularly the late Grand Chief Sir Paulias Matane, who was one of the first students of the school since its establishment in 1947.
“The school has come a long way to become one of the oldest and thriving institutions in the province,” Mr. Varpit added.
Today, Tauran Primary School hosts an extended Malabunga Campus, a Flexible Open and Distance Education centre, and a primary school, which is in the process of transitioning into a stand-alone junior high school under the 1-6-6 structure."
Historic aircraft to be preserved,09/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5991,"Papua New Guinea’s aviation heritage can now be proudly displayed following the opening of a purpose-built Aviation Heritage Centre at the Papua New Guinea National Museum and Art Gallery in Port Moresby.
The new facility, opened by Papua New Guinea's Minister for Finance, Thomas Opa MP and Australia’s Chief of Air Force Air Marshal Stephen Chappell DSC CSC OAM, provides a permanent home for the museum’s World War Two-era Douglas A-20 Havoc bomber and other historic Papua New Guinean aircraft and Royal Australian Air Force Wirraway aircraft.
The centre was built as a collaboration between the Royal Australian Air Force and the Papua New Guinea National Museum and Art Gallery, seeking to provide an appropriate home for historic aircraft of mutual significance to Australia and Papua New Guinea for years to come.
Rodney Graham, a Port Moresby resident, helped install many of the new Centre’s exhibitions, with his company – Rods Construction Ltd – utilising cranes and forklifts to set the items in place. The project has contributed PGK39 million (AUD14m) to the local economy since 2023.
For Mr. Graham, the new Centre ensures that his, and future generations, are reminded of the sacrifices of the past and the shared history between Australia and Papua New Guinea.
“I wasn’t born when these things happened and this Centre helps us to think of our history – our shared history – and the things that happened long ago,” Mr. Graham said.
“It means a lot to be invited to be here, and to be involved in a milestone event for Papua New Guinea.”
For Air Marshal Chappell, the Centre is reminiscent of Papua New Guinea and Australia’s defence relationship.
“The Aviation Heritage Centre and the World War Two-era Douglas A-20 Havoc Bomber stand as a permanent reminder of an enduring defence relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea, forged through shared tenacity and sacrifice during World War Two,” Air Marshal Chappell said.
“The opening of this purpose-built facility acknowledges and celebrates the work being undertaken to safeguard and celebrate Papua New Guinea’s aviation history and heritage.”
“This Aviation Centre is a gift of friendship - thank you for being a good friend to us, for always showing up for us and your mutual respect.”
The Centre already has a new addition, with Air Marshal Chappell providing a new exhibition at the opening.
He presented pictorial history books and photos taken of Papua New Guinea’s Douglas DC3s in the mid-1970s by the first Commanding Officer of the Air Transport Squadron – William “Stew” McAllister – to the current Papua New Guinea Defence Force Air Transport Wing Commanding Officer Lt Col Douglas Vavar and Director of Air Operations, Lieutenant Colonel Nancy Wii.
The Papua New Guinea Defence Force, the Royal Australian Air Force and Papua New Guinea National Museum and Art Gallery continue to work together to ensure the ongoing preservation and display of aviation artefacts of mutual interest.

PNG demands regional drug action,09/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5989,"Papua New Guinea has issued a strong call for urgent and practical regional cooperation to combat rising social threats, particularly the spread of methamphetamine across the Pacific.
The statement was delivered during the 54th Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting, currently underway in Honiara from September 8 to 12, 2025.
Addressing the Heads of the Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP), Minister Jelta Wong highlighted the urgent need for tangible collaboration to protect Pacific people and their way of life, including strengthening the surveillance and security of maritime borders.
He underscored that while collaboration is frequently discussed, it often lacks real-world implementation.
""We need to move past rhetoric and turn our ideas into action,"" Minister Wong stated. ""The alarming rise of methamphetamine in our region is a critical issue that requires immediate and serious attention.""
He cited the challenges faced by Pacific nations in implementing initiatives, such as the East New Britain Initiative, due to interventions from large international fishing interests. ""We have to work harder to implement our interventions,"" he said.
Minister Wong also acknowledged the work of Dr. Stuart Minchin, Director General of the South Pacific Community, for his efforts to support people with disabilities, calling it a significant social issue that impacts every country in the region.
However, he returned to the threat of methamphetamine, calling it a detrimental social issue that is often overlooked.
He warned that if the region does not tackle the drug problem now, it will have far-reaching consequences.
""We have small populations, and the reality of rising methamphetamine use throughout our region means we could lose our people, our traditions, and our cultures because of this one synthetic drug that we are unable to control,"" Minister Wong concluded.
The Pacific Islands Forum is the region’s premier political and economic policy organization. It brings together leaders from across the Pacific to address critical issues and promote cooperation."

Acting Correctional Service Commissioner Bernard Nepo in a special visit to the Beon Correctinal facility yesterday (08 September) wept openly, reassuring prisoners of their dignity as human beings and as citizens of PNG and not to allow the walls to confine their views of the outside world.
He told the inmates that regardless of their offenses, they remain Papua New Guineans and are brothers, fathers and sons to someone.
Nepo was at the maximum-security unit, updating the inmates about changes taking within CIS and how it will help to rehabilitate them to be good citizens after they leave.
These changes will be implemented nationwide and Nepo emphasized that the institution was there to assist them get back up on their feet and eventually they will have to go back into the society reformed.

Sunday’s victory was a defining moment for Muruks, ending their 13-year drought since their last grand final appearance in 2012 against the Gurias, where they lost 10-14.
After going down to Lae Snax Tigers in the major semi-final a week earlier, the Rodrick Puname-coached side played a more controlled and disciplined game with few errors.
Gurias, on the other hand, started on the wrong foot with too many errors, mainly in their attacking sets, and a breakdown in their defensive structure allowed Muruks to capitalize on for much-needed points.
Muruks set their platform early when Jade Puk opened the Gurias' middle defense to send Victor Ario for the opening try in the 12th minute to take the lead 6-0. Gurias came into play later in the end when winger Myles Banam scored a four-pointer at the 31st minute to trail 4-6.
Muruks continued their dominance in the first half with Lega Batia crossing just before half time to score to extend the lead 12-4.
Muruks continued their tempo in the second when hooker Jerry Joe exploded out of dummy half to catch the Gurias defense of guard to put his team further in front in the 43rd minute before Batia again showcased his attacking prowess when he skipped passed Gurias defense to put the case beyond reach at 20 -4.
A late surge by Gurias did not threaten the Muruks' line until the dying minutes of the second half, when they scored two tries in quick succession through Banam and Emil Benjamin, but it was too little too late at the sound of the final siren."

Campaign against ‘OBT’,08/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5968,"The landowners of Lae city are taking a stand against the unpopular criminal trend called ‘Operesen Brukim Tulait’, or OBT, by identifying those involved and handing them to police.
Butibam’s deputy chairman and secretary for the Council of Chiefs, Gibing Jethro, said they are frustrated as they cannot live and move around freely on their own land.
Butibam village has been reporting incidences of ‘OBT robberies for the past two months. Different communities have different versions of OBT Gangs. However, the gang’s strategy is to overwhelm their victims through sheer number – most numbering over 50 – and attacking after midnight.
Youth from the village have been vigilantly patrolling their respective areas since the last major break-and-enter in August that saw over 50 men break into a home at 2am, holding an elderly woman and her grandchildren at gunpoint while they ransacked the place.
On the night of Wednesday, September 3rd, over 15 armed men held up a company drop-off vehicle along Awagasi and Asu Talair. Butibam villagers managed to apprehend and beat up three of the suspects before handing them to police early the next day. Butibam’s deputy chairman expressed their frustration at the growing crime rate that has made even landowners feel unsafe.
“It was happening to other people outside, we were concerned until it happened right in our village,” he stated. “In our village, they came in and this elderly woman was sitting and shaking; that incident has infuriated us. You can see the frustration we had, and we recently demonstrated that.”
“As landowners, we condemn this criminal trend and we’ve already taken some measures, in collaboration with the police.
“The leaders have agreed to the concept of eviction into the communities. Those settling on our land, if we find out – and surely, we will – that you are involved in these illegal activities in our village or city, we will not hesitate. We will identify their areas and move with police and we will forcefully evict them.
“We are in our village; it’s a very good place. We are a peace-loving people and we have even given land to people to settle. We will be celebrating 50 years of independence for our country and we want to ensure that our village is safe and secure.”

PM Marape salutes fathers,07/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5953,"In commemorating Father’s Day today, Prime Minister James Marape has called on fathers, men, and young boys of Papua New Guinea to ""arise and serve the nation"" as the country approaches its historic 50th Independence Anniversary on 16 September.
In his Father’s Day message, Prime Minister Marape paid tribute to the invaluable role that fathers and male figures play in shaping strong families, resilient communities, and a united nation.
“Our National Anthem begins with the powerful call, ‘O arise all you sons of this land.’ This is not just a lyric — it is a national responsibility,” said Prime Minister Marape. “As we prepare to celebrate 50 years of Independence, I urge every man and father in Papua New Guinea to arise, take your rightful place in society, and be the role models our children can look up to.”
Prime Minister Marape emphasized that the call to arise is more than physical—it is a spiritual and moral duty, rooted in faith, integrity, and service.
“We must live according to God's Word. We must lead by example in our homes, communities, churches, and workplaces. The country needs men who are grounded in faith, strong in character, and respectful in conduct,” he said.
The Prime Minister also appeals for respect and protection of women and girls, saying that the strength of the nation depends on the well-being and safety of all its people.
“To the fathers and men of Papua New Guinea: We are called not just to lead, but to serve with humility, to protect with courage, and to love with compassion,” said Prime Minister Marape. “Let us teach our sons to honour women and girls. Let us build a culture where respect is the foundation of every relationship.”
As the country counts down to its Golden Jubilee of Independence, PM Marape stated that the future of Papua New Guinea lies in the hands of its families — and the fathers who lead them.
“A strong nation is built on strong families. And strong families are built by responsible fathers,” he said. “Let us rise to the occasion, build up our homes, guide our children, and work together for a better and brighter future.”
Prime Minister Marape concluded by thanking all fathers, grandfathers, uncles, brothers, and male mentors who are standing tall in their communities.
“On this Father’s Day, I honour all the men who are doing their part, quietly and faithfully, to raise good children, support their partners, and make a difference. Your role is sacred. You are needed now more than ever.
""Happy Father's Day to all the Fathers in our country today. May God bless you all, and May God bless Papua New Guinea."""

The celebration was filled with patriotism, history, and reflection, as students learned about the nation’s journey to self-governance.
Among the special guests was Dafol Kamili, who was just 16 years old when Papua New Guinea raised its flag for the first time in 1975.
Sharing his memories, Kamili recalled the emotions of that historic day and a poignant exchange between Australia’s Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and PNG’s founding father, Sir Michael Somare.
“Gough Whitlam told Michael Somare, ‘How can you become an independent state when you don’t have doctors, teachers, pilots, lawyers?’ And Michael Somare replied, ‘Can you see the mothers sitting with their grass skirts? They are hiding them under their skirts.’

“I was so young and saw our country living up to its highest hope as a developing nation with no bloodshed. I am happy to share this memory with these children as a reminder that this country has so much to offer.”
Established in 2010 as an elementary school and upgraded to primary status in 2013, Tanam Adventist has grown from an initial 150 students to nearly 800 enrollees today. Students travel from as far as Fourteen-Mile and Markham Farms, attracted by the school’s accessibility and quality of education.

He said rumors on social media regarding disruption are unverified and should be disregarded. The public has been urged to rely on official communications.

Villagers retaliate against gang,05/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5942,"A 25-seater company bus, doing staff drop off on the night of Wednesday, September 3rd, was held up by armed men in Lae, Morobe Province.
It was between 10.30pm and 11pm when the vehicle, driving towards Butibam village from Awagasi, near Kamkumung, was surrounded by over 15 armed men when it slowed to go over a road hump.
“The men were standing on the roadside, in the dark,” shared one of the 12 passengers in the bus at that time. His name is being withheld for safety reasons.
“The bus windows were not tinted so they could clearly see each of us in the bus and they pointed their firearms right at each of us and ordered us out.
“They repeatedly kicked the door of the bus until it gave way. They dragged the driver out so all of us followed.”
Fortunately, no female staff were on board at that time.
All the men were made to lie face down on the muddy road while the group of men took their bags and started going through their pockets, one by one.
“At least six different men rummaged through my pockets while I was lying on the ground,” this newsroom was told. “They even checked the small watch pocket. I overheard one of them saying, ‘Check their fronts. Some of them hide stuff there’.
“They tried rolling me over many times but I refused to budge.
“They removed everything from our pockets, including wallets, cigarettes, lighters, loose change and even the NRL guide that I had in my back pocket.
“There was a family standing in front of a tucker box and when they saw what was happening, they tried to confront the men. That was when they fired at them.
“When I heard the gunshot, I lifted my head to look up. That was when I felt something hard hit me in the back of the head. They then pushed my head down into the mud with the butt of their firearm.
“After they were satisfied with their raid, they walked down while we got up, checked on each other then got on the bus and headed to the police station.
“Only three of us in the bus had hidden our phones when we knew were getting robbed.
“I retrieved my phone and notified my family.”
A number of staff on board were from Butibam village, and they had also called their families.
The village had been alert for a month now following an attack on an elderly woman and her family on the outskirts of Butibam.
Residents from Bumantop and Hengali came to the roadside and were standing there when they saw four unknown men walking towards them.
They accosted them and searched them, where they found a homemade gun and a number of wallets.
Additionally, one of them was wearing a boot that was taken off one of the passengers from Butibam.
While trying to bring them into the village, one of the men escaped. Men and youth from the village started beating up the other three suspects, one of whom was eventually identified as a resident there.
By midnight on Thursday, September 4th, Butibam’s deputy chairman and secretary for the Council of Chiefs, Gibing Jethro, issued a call to police to pick up the badly injured suspects.
When commending Butibam for taking action against crime, Lae Metropolitan Superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, confirmed that the suspects are part of the unpopular criminal trend called ‘Operesen Brukim Tulait’, or OBT.
Different communities have different versions of OBT Gangs. However, the gang’s strategy is to overwhelm their victims through sheer number – most numbering over 50 – and attacking after midnight.
“I’d like to say, I’m very pleased, I’m very happy with what the Butibam villagers have done,” Kunyanban stated.
“It should go back to other communities as well. They have to be working together, they have to have their neighbourhood watch together, they have to address this issue together.”"

Locals commended for apprehending suspects,05/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5937,"Lae Metropolitan Superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, has commended members of a community who apprehended some suspects as they were escaping from an alleged holdup.
Three men, believed to be part of a group called Operesen Brukim Tulait, or OBT, ran right into the hands of Butibam villagers on Wednesday night, where they were stripped and beaten up.
With Independence approaching, criminal activities have picked up around the city, and Lae Metropolitan Superintendent, Kunyanban drew attention to the unpopular criminal trend called Operesen Brukim Tulait.
Different communities in the city have their own versions of OBT gangs; some have more than 50 people that include women and children, while others have mostly young men. The identifying factors are; they walk around in very large groups and they mostly strike after midnight; when the community is asleep.
Late on Wednesday (September 3rd) night, locals at Butibam village – one of the areas affected by OBT robberies – caught five men who were allegedly on the run after holding up a company drop off vehicle along Awagasi and Asu Talair.
While two of them managed to escape, the other three were not so lucky, as they were stripped and beaten up by frustrated villagers.
At 12am on Thursday, September 4th, community leader, Gibson Jethro, posted a call to the police to pick up the suspects.
Kunyanban applauded the community, saying victims of crime have the right to defend themselves.
“I’d like to say, I’m very pleased, I’m very happy with what the Butibam villagers have done,” he stated. “It should go back to other communities as well. They have to be working together, they have to have their neighbourhood watch together, they have to address this issue.
“If you really look at the OBT, those are the kids back in the community. The community has knowledge of these people. The community has to address this issue together. They cannot put the blame on police all the time. Police cannot be there all the time.”
Kunyanban emphasised that police manpower and logistics are low, compared to the increased population and the uncontrolled movement of people into the cities.
Meantime, the three suspects, who are in police custody, had to be taken to the hospital for medical attention."

NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab said the objective of this partnership is to keep the city safe through a team effort, as the police cannot do it alone.

PMV driver detained for beating police officer,05/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5934,"The PMV driver who allegedly beat up a police officer at the Lae Top Town bus stop yesterday morning is now in police custody.
Lae Metropolitan Superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, said one of their officers from the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) was making his way to the Top Town police station when a PMV driver, who was allegedly driving recklessly, almost hit him.
“That prompted him to ask the driver to stop and he told the driver to drive properly as there are a lot of people at the bus stop,” said Kunyanban.
The Lae commander said the PMV driver hopped out and started throwing punches at the CID officer, with other people joining in the scuffle as well.
“Eventually, some of them realised that he was a policeman but the damage was already caused.
“Our units responded to this and apprehended the driver. The driver has been charged and will appear before the court shortly.”
The incident led to a temporary closure of the town bus stop.
Kunyanban further pointed out that this is the kind of careless attitude that police have been talking to drivers about.
“If you are at the bus stop, drive slowly. Stop revving the engine and trying to weave in and out of traffic. This is causing a lot of headaches not only to the police but the public as well.
“Individuals who have driver’s licences need to comply with traffic regulations and adhere to the traffic signs that are placed on the different roads.
“Enough with the revving and rushing at bus stops. There should be some sort of order at bus stops.
“It’s the attitude that’s the problem.”"

The military tattoo is a performance of music or a display of armed forces in general. The term comes from the early 17th-century Dutch phrase doe den tap toe ('turn off the tap'), a signal sounded by drummers or trumpeters to instruct innkeepers near military barracks to stop serving beer and for soldiers to return to their barracks. It is unrelated to the ink tattoo that was borrowed from Tahiti.

The farmers received a pleasant surprise on Saturday, August 30, 2025 when local cocoa exporter, Linguan and Company visited the village and paid them cash.
The farmers collectively sold three tones of dried cocoa beans after a major rehabilitation program, initiated by memberss of a local non—governmental organization called Inland cocoa Technical (ICT), a group formed by the farmers in Madang.

IMF urges Reform Discipline,04/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5926,"Papua New Guinea’s economy is gaining international confidence, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting a 4.5% growth rate for 2025, placing the country among the stronger performers in the Asia-Pacific region.
The update was delivered this morning by IMF Country Head Sohrab Rafiq at the Port Moresby Chamber of Commerce and Industry (POMCCI) breakfast briefing, attended by business leaders and policy advocates.
Rafiq praised PNG’s recent economic strides, citing low inflation, improved foreign exchange access, and sustained growth despite global headwinds.
He noted that inflation had dropped below 1% in late 2024, though recent data shows a sharp rebound to 5.28% in Q1 2025, driven by rising food, transport, and betelnut prices.
“The reform momentum is real, and the results are visible,” Rafiq said. “But discipline must continue, especially in fiscal transparency and monetary consistency.”
However, he emphasized that the shift reflects true market realities and could lead to eventual appreciation as foreign inflows rise, provided that the central bank maintains consistent policy to avoid destabilising price effects.
The IMF’s $918 million loan program, approved in 2023, has supported PNG’s reform agenda, including a flexible exchange rate system aimed at attracting private investment and reducing long-term borrowing costs.
Rafiq outlined key improvements since the launch of the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility in 2023, including:
•	A projected GDP growth rate of 4.6% for 2025
•	A sharp drop in inflation in late 2024 (rebounding to 5.28% in Q1 2025)
•	Reduced wait times for foreign exchange access, now averaging 2–4 weeks for SMEs
He credited the government’s reform discipline and the Bank of Papua New Guinea’s shift to a flexible exchange rate system, which has helped restore investor confidence and improve market transparency.
The IMF also flagged the upcoming Papua LNG project as a potential catalyst for growth, noting that improved international sentiment could lower borrowing costs for resource-linked infrastructure.
Still, Rafiq warned that LNG-linked spending could raise urban living costs by up to 40% without targeted mitigation.

UK Minister to make 50th anniversary visit to PNG,04/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5925,"The United Kingdom’s Minister for the Indo-Pacific, Catherine West is scheduled to visit Papua New Guinea from the 05th to the 05th of September where cooperation in defence will be one of her agendas.
The visit comes during PNG’s 50th anniversary “Defence Force” week and will attend the Military Tattoo which will see the UK Pipe and Drum Majors from the First Battalion Scots Guards join the PNG and Australian Defence Force Pipes and Drums for a combined performance.
Alongside Defence Minister Dr Billy Joseph, Minister West is expected to sign a new “Ship Rider” agreement which will allow PNG officials to travel on British Navy vessels and carry out law enforcement within the country’s maritime territory.
She will also meet British Royal Navy personnel from HMS Tamar, one of two Royal Navy vessels located in the region.
Other areas Minister West is expected to engage in include forest governance, climate change and economic development.
She will also announce new grant funding for sustainable agriculture and biodiversity conservation projects to tackle the climate and nature crisis.
The Minister is due to meet Prime Minister James Marape and Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko to express the UK’s congratulations as Papua New Guinea marks 50 years of independence.
“It is an honour to represent the UK at this significant milestone for Papua New Guinea, an important partner for us in the Pacific,” Minister West said.

TB services boosted in Pomio District,04/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5923,"People of Pomio District in East New Britain Province can now access timely, reliable and life-saving TB services following the installation of a 10-color GeneXpert instrument and the commissioning of four new TB Basic Management Units (BMUs) in the district.
The National Department of Health (NDoH) last week, presented the GeneXpert Machine to East New Britain Provincial Health Authority (ENBPHA) CEO Dr. Ako Yap and Pomio District Administrator John Liskia to help address what may be a sleeping health crisis in Pomio district.
This makes Pomio the first district in PNG to have a 10-color GeneXpert machine with world-class TB diagnostic capacity that can rapidly diagnose Tb including drug resistant TB.
It can also cater for genotypic drug sensitivity testing for common first and second line TB drugs used in PNG.
These services are only available in provincial hospitals and with Pomio now having these services, it is now on par with provincial hospitals.
These developments follow a recent call by Health Minister and Member for Pomio, Elias Kapavore, declaring war on TB, representing not only a turning point for Pomio, but also a model for scaling up TB response in other remote districts across PNG. It also demonstrates the commitment of the National Department of Health, PHAs and partners to leave no one behind in the ‘War to End TB’.
The installation of the GeneXpert machine was done by the CPHL team from the National Department of Health and ENB Provincial Laboratory team. The GeneXpert installation and the assessment and commissioning of four BMUs in Pomio was supported by PATH as a partner in the War to End TB in collaboration with the ENB PHA.
While thanking the NDoH and acknowledging ongoing support from partners to improve health outcomes in the province, Dr. Yap urged health workers to work together to address health challenges in East New Britain.
“Our people must work together to maximize use of resources. We need to integrate our programs – government, churches – to serve our people,” said Dr. Yap from NDoH.
He acknowledged the work of the churches which run almost 80 per cent of the rural health services program in Pomio District.
“At the moment, we don’t have good TB services demonstrating the burden of TB in Pomio. We only have eight (8) BMUs in Gazelle and we need to work together to ensure we transfer skills to our health workers,” said Dr. Yap.
Procured with the support of World Bank-funded COVID-19 Emergency Response Project implemented by the NDoH, the 10-colour Gene-Xpert machine uses an automated system to perform rapid testing for various diseases including tuberculosis (TB), HIV Early Infant Diagnosis, Human Papiloma Virus (HPV), and COVID-19, providing diagnostic results within less than 2 hours, and detects TB with higher sensitivity unlike traditional lab tests.
This simplifies testing and makes it possible to get accurate results in settings without extensive lab infrastructure."
Seven Vessels from Five Nations Parade in PNG’s Historic Fleet Review,04/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5921,"Papua New Guineans lined the waterfront at APEC Haus in Port Moresby today (04 September) to watch naval crews stood to attention and ships passed in formation during a Fleet Review in the waters near APEC House, reviewed by the Governor-General Grand Chief Sir Bob Dadae.
The event brought together seven vessels from Papua New Guinea, India, France, Tonga and Australia. It served as a formal naval inspection, showcasing discipline, tradition and the cooperation that links Pacific maritime partners.
This was the first time PNG witnessed a fleet review, normally conducted to celebrate a significant naval event such as a jubilee or to remember an historic event (such as the Battle of Trafalgar).
As each vessel passed the review point, crew members saluted to the Governor General and in response two ceremonial guns were fired.
Seven vessels sailed past the review point to honour PNG’s proud naval traditions and recognize the important work done by PNG Defence forces both in national waters and the wider Pacific region.
Director of Maritime Operations for PNGDF, Commander Sebastian Marru, spoke of the fleet review and how it was a success even though one vessel couldn’t make it.
“The lead ship was the guide ship, meaning that every other ship in that sequence would take reference from the lead ship, and then maintain their positions as they go through. We actually planned for eight vessels. However, unfortunately, The Cape Gloucester couldn’t make it this morning. So, seven completed the fleet review today and it was successful.”
The fleet began with the Indian Ship (INS) Kadmatt, of the Indian Navy that was first to pass the review point, sailing behind with a 600-yard spacing was French Navy ship Auguste Benebig of the French armed forces of New Caledonian, followed by the Patrol Boat Ngahau Koula of the Tonga maritime force,  then PNG’s HMPNG Ted Diro, HMPNG Rochus Lokinap and HMPNG Gilbert Toropo of the PNGDF, before closing the fleet with His Majesty's Australian ship Childers of the Royal Australian navy.
When Marru was asked whether the country will witness another event as such, he said “hopefully”.
“Well, I wouldn't say yes, however, any major event may come up, hopefully we may see one again. If we don't see here, other countries, those partner nations, will host fleet reviews. Just like Tonga, when they had there 50 years last year, our own Gilbert Toropo was deployed to Tonga, doing exactly the same thing. So even if we don't have any in the near future, we still participate with our other naval counterparts.”
This spectacular maritime salute honours PNG’s proud naval traditions and recognizes the important work done by the country’s Defence forces both in national waters and the wider Pacific region."

Government taken to task over NID project,04/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5919,"The NID blame game continued in Tuesday’s parliament sitting. Minister for Administrative and Support services, Richard Masere announced plans to migrate to a biometric system of voting in the 2027 General elections using NID.
In response, Member for Hiri Koiari, Keith joined other members of parliament describing the NID project as a failed one and asked the government to admit this fact.
Iduhu shared that the NID biometric only covers 10 percent of the country’s population.
“It is safe to say that it is a failed project and so it baffles me as to how the Minister (Richard Masere) intends to migrate that little 10 percent to a biometric dream of voting in 2027. Does the Minister agree that his mandate given by the Prime Minister to discharge this very important work has failed and therefore he too has failed this country?” asked Iduhu.
Masere in providing his response blamed the previous government for creating the NID program for political convenience.
“They had created an agency that operated outside of the constitution, because of the political convenience and then as a result of that we had two agencies running parallel duplicating the same work. When I became Minister, I had to correct those issues that were created by former government,” said Richard Masere.
Masere’s biometric plans were met with more objection with Member for Ialibu-Pangia, Peter O’Neill joining the debate.
“Minister (Masere) is alluding that the funds were misused by the former government is incorrect… Do not point fingers, Minister admit your failures, so that you can correct your failures for once.”
But Minister Masere assured that the government has underfunded NID in the past 3 to 4 years and needed to gain more partnerships with members of parliament to drive the NID program in electorates."

Siune slams attack on Simbu public servants,04/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5915,"Member for Kerowagi, Francis Siune, expressed disappointment over an attack on public servants and property at Druamugl, Simbu Province, over an assault incident last week.
The attack on police officers and the district administration officials stemmed from disagreements between local government representatives and the people over the change of venue for the 50th independence celebrations in Kup LLG.
In an earlier report, Simbu Provincial Police Commander Superintendent Mazuc Rubiang said the policemen were responding to the dispute when they were attacked.
Three police guns and a police vehicle were recovered, and three policemen were rescued on Sunday, August 31st, following an attack at Druamugle village in Kerowagi.
Sinue said the change of venue for the 50th Independence anniversary celebration happened for a reason, and it could have been addressed amicably when the District Administrator and Policemen were present at Druamugl. Instead, it demonstrated that our people and community leaders lack reasoning ability and analytical skills in decision-making.
He said it is only through respectful engagement that we can resolve differences and move forward together as a united community.
Siune state, “Unfortunately, the recent actions witnessed at Druamugl reflect a serious lapse in attitude and behavior, which continues to be a major obstacle to the progress and development of our district. I am deeply saddened and disturbed by the attack on three (3) police officers and the District Administrator for Kerowagi District. These public servants suffered both physical and psychological harm in the line of duty, and I extend my heartfelt sympathies to them and their families.”
“I am disappointed by the damage done to the vehicle belonging to the District Police Station Commander. Public servants, government assets, and institutions are in place to serve the people, and it is our shared responsibility to protect and respect them. Damaging these resources undermines the very services and protections that our people depend on.”
“Kerowagi District Development Authority will take full responsibility for repairing the damaged police vehicle. It’s not that we support such a negative approach from the community, but to demonstrate that KDDA is committed to upholding law and order in our district, which is truly the foundation upon which government services can be delivered and supports sustainable developments in the district.”
“The actions of those involved in this incident are completely unacceptable. I call for a full investigation into the matter. All findings must be properly compiled and submitted, and justice must be served where it is due.”
“I urge all citizens to exercise maturity, respect for law and order, and a spirit of unity as we commemorate this important milestone in our nation's history,” Sinue added."
Moveave peace committee want troublemakers arrested,03/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5912,"The Moveave Peace Committee in Gulf province is urging local police and government to address infighting between the Kamea and Moveave tribes. Recently, a peace talk was held between leaders of the two tribes to address ethnic differences. The committee shared that it has been months since the ethnic clash in late 2024, where homes and lives were lost. All parties want troublemakers brought to justice.
In 2024, a tribal conflict erupted between the Kamea and Moveave tribes after an incident that resulted in loss of lives and destruction to personal property including homes and gardens. The Kameas in the hinterlands of Gulf province access the coast through the Taure and Lakekamu rivers which is home to the Moveave people. The Moveave Peace Committee said they are concerned that since the conflict has not been addressed, tension remains, and conflict is likely.  Moveave Peace Committee Secretary Victor Isouve, is calling on the provincial government and police to arrest those responsible for the killings.
“The incident transpired from a criminal offence where a youth from Kamea was murdered within the 600 alluvial Gold mining site,” said Victor Isouve – Secretary Moveave Peace Committee. “The incident happened in September 2024 (and) in retaliation the Kameas mobilized and killed another youth from Moveave.”
People have been living in fear for months. Moveave Peace Committee Chairman, Herbert Pokana wants police to act quickly.
“It has taken us almost 10 months, we have got the government and police involved, but 10months down the road and there is little progress on this,” Pokana said. “It’s taken over 2 months now for the government to actually respond to the ceasefire agreement.”
A meeting was held on Thursday, August 28, between the Committee and Moveave villagers, and they have threatened to block the road along the Taure and Laekekamu bridges on the main Gulf Trans highway if authorities do not respond within 7 days. The ultimatum came into effect Tuesday September 2.
Gulf Provincial Police Commander Jefferey Lemb, is aware of the situation and has been at the forefront of negotiating for peace. He has also slammed the committee’s plan of action.
PPC Lemb said police are also having a tough time going after those who committed all the murders related to this issue, because of the harsh terrain and challenging geography. Lemb also warned that issuing threats to authorities does help the situation."
Tokura recollects years of service to Police force,03/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5910,"Chief of Bougainville Police Service, Deputy Commissioner Francis Tokura was among the first pioneers to train at Bomana Police College when the training program was first introduced in 1990.
Tokura joined the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) in 1979, four years after PNG gained independence. However, he was serving as a constable until 1990, when the cadet program was introduced, and he was among others who joined the program for the first time.
Initially, the officer cadet program was facilitated at Igam Barracks, but that responsibility was given back to RPNGC in 1990.
“We started our training in 1990 as officer cadets and graduated in 1993 after three years. I graduated as a young inspector, and I was posted to the police headquarters, where I joined the computer section, which is now the ICT directorate. After I served in the computer section for several years, I was promoted to Acting Director for Personnel and Training in 2002. The Personnel and Training Director, which is now the Human Resource Directorate.
“I served all my years at the police headquarters. However, I was only deployed to the Highlands region for election-related purposes.
“My first posting out of the headquarters was in 2008, where I was posted to the New Guinea Islands as the divisional police commander. At that time, Bougainville was given the autonomous government arrangement, so it wasn’t under my command.
“In 2010, I was recalled to Police headquarters as the divisional commander for NCD/Central.
“In 2015, I was appointed the Chief of the Bougainville Police Service, and have been serving till now,” he said.
Tokura said, like other law enforcement agencies, Bougainville police continue to face constraints with limited manpower, lack of proper training, limited accommodation, and limited vehicles. However, they strive to overcome these challenges with progressive steps to rebuild the force.
Reflecting back on his 46 years with the force, Tokura said as he signed his last contract this year, he looks forward to retirement with hope and determination that the Bougainville police force will rebuild its strength as the youngest police force if it gained independence.
Tokura says his contribution to the RPNGC will remain a legacy and a lasting reminder that working in a law and order profession comes with courage, determination, and passion to fight corruption, hold lawbreakers accountable, and ensure that vulnerable groups such as women and girls are protected."

Solar kits light up South Fly homes,01/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5871,"More than 1,100 remote households in Papua New Guinea’s South Fly District in Western Province have received solar lighting kits as part of a major rural electrification initiative supported by Australia’s Western Province Partnership.
The rollout, which took place between May and August 2025, targeted 29 communities in the Morehead Local-Level Government (LLG) area.
Each household received a kit containing a solar panel, three LED lights, and a battery unit with USB charging ports. The initiative is part of a broader effort to expand access to electricity in rural and remote areas of Papua New Guinea.
By early 2026, the program aims to deliver and install over 8,000 solar kits across the district’s four LLGs: Morehead, Forecoast Kiwai, Oriomo-Bituri, and Fly-Kiwai.
The project is a collaboration between the Western Province Partnership, the Provincial Administration, LLG leaders, the South Fly Rangers, and local communities.
A local steering committee, chaired by South Fly District Administrator Wasewa Saebi, oversees the program.
The response from residents has been overwhelmingly positive. For many, this is the first time they’ve had access to reliable lighting in their homes.
“I am grateful that this service has been rendered to my people,” said Thomas Sumari, community chief of Morehead Station and board chairman of Morehead High School. “Seeing their homes light up at night is a reminder of the positive changes that are underway in our region.
“With these lights installed in households, our day students can study more effectively at night in the comfort of their homes.”
The South Fly Rangers are playing a key role in delivering the kits and engaging with communities. They ensure that distribution criteria are met and that the program’s goals are clearly communicated to all stakeholders.

PNGPCL delivers climate-resilient port in Kimbe,01/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5864,"PNG Ports Corporation Ltd (PNG Ports) will deliver a ‘climate change resilient’ K340 million port to the people of West New Britain Province.
This will also provide more than 300 job opportunities, spin-off benefits for locals, and multiple future business opportunities.
At the groundbreaking ceremony held last Friday, PNG Ports chairman, Harvey Nii said this significant investment was for the people of West New Britain, who house Kimbe Port - PNG Ports’ third busiest port.
The project is funded by the Australian Government through the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific.
Nii explained that the 16-month project would see the existing port undergo “major marine and land rehabilitation works” to increase cargo volumes and vessel traffic by 2027.
He said upon completion, the upgraded port infrastructure will be climate-resilient, with the incorporation of climate change, disaster resilience, and social inclusion in the project design.
The Kimbe Port is critical to the growth of the New Guinea Islands.
Last year, 252 vessels were received at the port, with a throughput of over 450,000 revenue tonnage, much of which is attributed to the trade of crude oil palm oil, cocoa, vanilla, copra, fish, and logging.
Minister for State Enterprise, William Duma, said this crucial project marked a “transformative chapter” for the province.
“We must remind ourselves that we are not merely launching a construction project; we are laying the foundation for enhanced connectivity, stronger national unity, and sustainable prosperity for generations to come,” Minister Duma said.
“As our country marks 50 years of Independence, it is a moment for all of us to reflect on our achievements, acknowledge all the obstacles we had to overcome over the years and renew our commitment to building a new future for our children and our grandchildren.”
“The Kimbe rehabilitation perfectly reflects the vision of our founding fathers, one with opportunity and development for every district, coastline and province in our country,” he said.

"Visit to remote Kotidanga, an eye-opener",31/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5860,"During a recent visit to Kotidanga in Gulf Province, and witnessing the reality and struggles faced by the people, the government has committed to continuing to deliver vital government services in rural areas of the country.
Prime Minister James Marape last week opened the road access into Kotidanga – a once-isolated hinterland area of Gulf Province.
Speaking to a large gathering at Kotidanga, a rugged frontier that now connects the Gulf
and Morobe provinces, during the opening of the Trans National Corridor Missing Link between Gulf and Morobe, PM Marape said the new road marked a historic step towards
linking long-isolated areas to the rest of the country.
“Although this is not yet a highway, one day it will be,” the Prime Minister said. “Step by
step, kilometre by kilometre, we are opening up roads so that our people are no longer cut
off. This road will one day unite the Papuan side with the Highlands, running as a true
national highway.”
PM Marape acknowledged that past leaders, including the founding prime ministers, Sir Michael Somare, Sir Julius Chan, Pais Wingti, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, Bill Skate, Sir Mekere Morauta, and
Peter O’Neill had aspired to connect remote parts of PNG, but the cost of the road construction had always been a major obstacle.
When addressing local demands for compensation, the Prime Minister urged communities to focus instead on opportunities that the new road would create.
The Prime Minister emphasised that these are not just ordinary roads, but “economic corridors” designed to unlock opportunities in agriculture, tourism, and resource development.
“Kotidanga and Menyamya (Morobe) are rich coffee-growing territories. With road access, more coffee can now be exported to international markets, creating income for farmers.
“Roads also give our people the opportunity to participate in eco-tourism and other productive activities that strengthen the rural economy,” he said.
“This road is for you – our teachers, our rural health workers, and our missionaries who serve
tirelessly in remote communities. As we mark 50 years of independence, my government
commits that no teacher, health worker, or policeman in remote places like Kotidanga will
be forgotten,” PM Marape declared.
Meantime, K1 million would be allocated to the Kerema District Development Authority to build school infrastructure."

Joining the RPNGC on April 24, 1975, Guinness said he had the privilege to witness the ceremony firsthand as a first-time constable serving in the traffic unit.
“I was used as one of the traffic guys, standing at the junctions to direct traffic. We saw VIPs coming and going, and I had the opportunity to see the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare and Prince Charles, attending the ground-breaking ceremony at now the Parliament House. There was also a parade at Sir Hubert Murray Stadium, where the Australian flag was lowered and the PNG flag was raised.
“For me, it was a special moment for me, I really enjoyed this particular year 1975. After we gained independence, I was transferred to Mt Hagen, where I started my journey in the police force.
“I joined the police force as a Constable, and then I rose through the ranks, from Constable to Assistant Police Commissioner, I came through all the ranks, and I was able to get promoted every two years because of my commitment and dedication to duty. As an investigator, I contributed a lot to the organisation as far as law and order is concerned. As a result, I got promoted every two years, and I am happy with that.
“Because of my experiences, I usually tell my subordinates the way it was, the way it is, and the way forward.
“Based on my experience for the past 50 years serving the force, I noticed that previous governments have forgotten about the organisation, resulting in many things left deteriorated, particularly in housing and mobility.
“We have a good police force, but it has been mismanaged due to a lack of proper government support to enable the organization to run its affairs. We are not a money-making organisation, rather, we spend most of the money. However, when you see it from the law-and-order perspective, money doesn’t matter. Most of the law and order problems that are occurring in PNG can be managed if the police force is properly managed,” Guinness said.
ACP Guinness said this year will be the last year for him to serve the RPNGC, as he transitions into retirement. He carried with him a lasting impact and a heart of satisfaction as he had achieved most of his goals in safeguarding the people of Papua New Guinea in the justice sector."

AI powered CCTV cameras for NCD,30/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5845,"Over 80 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras will be installed in designated areas in Port Moresby in the next few months, as part of the NCDC’s CCTV rollout initiative.
The first phase of the initiative is the establishment of the control center, which has been completed at Alu the building in four-mile.
The second phase will be the installation of the cameras.
Parkop said the cameras are powered by Artificial Intelligence.
“AI will watch all the sites in the city, and it will detect if there is a problem and send the signal to the control room, where the police officers will pick up and address the issue with police officers on the ground.
“It will also capture facial identification, so perpetrators will also be identified.
“About 100 CCTVs were already installed through the PNG to China Society partnership, but it is not functioning due to no control room. Therefore, we will connect these cameras to the main control room as well,” he said.
Parkop said as the country approaches 50 years of independence, NCD is making an effort through this initiative to ensure the city is safe and secure for residents and visitors alike.
The initiative is a collaboration between the RPNGC and DataCo.
NCD/Central Commander Benjamin Turi in welcoming this initiative said, some of his officers have already been trained to facilitate the operation of the CCTVs.
However, Turi said more need to be done to train more police officers to drive this program, including technical expertise to assist police when the need arises.
While the initiative is ambitious, Parkop also highlighted the issue of unreliable power supply to power these cameras, noting that they ay look at solar or battery options for back up.
Meanwhile, Maigata Limited Project Manager, Himan Zhang said about 20 cameras will be streamed live starting next week.
The government has invested K15 million to support this initiative, adding to NCD’s K5 million funding."

Sir Julius Chan’s Legacy Immortalized on PNG’s Currency,30/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5841,"Papua New Guinea has paid tribute to one of its greatest founding fathers, the late Sir Julius Chan, as the nation celebrates 50 years of independence. His face has been officially featured on the new K100 note, launched during the milestone commemorative event in Port Moresby. This note will be released for circulation later in the year.
Delivering a heartfelt speech on behalf of the family, his youngest son, Julius Toea Chan, said the recognition was long overdue.
“PNG, we did it in fifty. We have come a long way in a very, very short time—from hunters and gatherers to who we are today: lawyers, doctors, teachers, bankers and so much more,” he told the audience.
Sir Julius was remembered as a humble yet visionary leader who prioritized the nation’s interests above all else. Known as the father of the kina and toea, he introduced PNG’s own currency on April 19, 1975—a step that firmly established the country’s financial independence.
“I cannot imagine the courage it must have taken to launch our nation’s own currency. To forge our own identity, as a nation independent from colonial masters,” said Julius Toea Chan.
The tribute coincided with the eve of what would have been Sir Julius’ 85th birthday. In a moment described by his son as “destiny,” the family honored both the currency’s 50th anniversary and Sir Julius’ lifelong service to the nation.
“My father never sought accolades or titles during his lifetime, he lived to serve… Tonight is the first time he has been officially recognized for his contributions to this country,” he added.
Sir Julius Chan’s enduring legacy now lives on—not only through his pioneering role in nation-building—but also in the currency that continues to define Papua New Guinea’s identity."

Royal Australian Mint Acting CEO Emily Martin described the release as a meaningful symbol, “Previously we worked with the bank of PNG on a colored circulating coin in 2015, to celebrate the Pacific Games and in 2018 for the Asia Pacific Economic Corporation forum. Papua New Guinea is one of only a few countries that releases colored coins into circulation like Australia and we’re very proud to support that and we’re very happy to be here today to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Independence through the release of these coins.”
BPNG Assistant Governor Ron Sikar confirmed the note is a one-off issue, “This is a one-off print, this is a commemorative print and it won’t be printed again.”

Empowering Kokoda teachers to champion inclusive education,29/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5835,"Australia continues to support inclusive education across Papua New Guinea by investing in teacher training that mainstreams and promotes disability inclusion in classrooms.
This support has enabled sixteen schoolteachers from ten elementary schools in the Kokoda Track region to participate for the first time in an inclusive education workshop held in Sogeri.
Facilitated by Callan Connect in collaboration with the Gerehu Inclusive Education Resource Centre (IERC), the training sought to equip teachers with practical strategies to support students with special needs.
This initiative aligns with PNG’s national education policy and reflects Australia’s ongoing commitment to working side-by-side with Papua New Guinea to build a more equitable education system for all. The workshop was more than just professional development – it was also a transformative experience.
Teachers developed Inclusive School Learning Improvement Plans (iSLIPs), which are designed to help schools allocate resources and create supportive learning environments tailored to students with diverse needs. One participant, Richard Sangai from Boridi Primary School, walked for two days through rugged terrain to attend.
“Students with special needs deserve the best possible education,” he said. “This training gives me the tools to help them thrive alongside their peers.”
Previously, families in remote areas faced significant financial burdens to accessing special education services.
By bringing training directly to teachers, Australia is helping to reduce these barriers and ensure every child has the opportunity to learn in an inclusive, supportive environment.
Australia is funding the Callan Services National Unit (CSNU) to roll out Callan Connect in Western Province and the Kokoda Track region. Australia is also partnering with New Zealand to implement Callan Connect in Bougainville.
Callan Connect is a two-year project aimed at providing disability screening, diagnostic assessment services, treatment, and referral to specialist services for individuals with disabilities.

Wewak youths trek with soldiers,29/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5830,"Over 25 youths from Wewak, East Sepik Province, are on foot patrol to Port Moresby on a special mission.
They traveled to Madang, then to Lae and Malalaua in Gulf Province. They are now in Central Province, expected to reach Port Moresby in the next few days ahead of PNG's 50th Independence Anniversary.
The Wewak Urban youth from 17 ward councils have joined the 1RPIR, who are on ""Exercise Antap long Ol 2025' walk and are trekking together. Reasons for this ambitious walk include promoting peace and stopping violence in PNG, and establishing a youth council office in Wewak.
Team leader Junior Sammy said they had split into two groups along the way, with 11 members of the group traveling up the Highlands region, and the rest followed the Bulldog Track to Malalaua, Gulf Province, before joining the 1RPIR on their way.
""Our cycling group does awareness on all forms of violence. We challenge youths to organize, register themselves, sit with their provincial coordinator, and seek if there's any way the government can assist youth programs,” Sammy said. “When we don't organize ourselves, that's when we don't get support from our government.”
Sammy added, ""Our focus now is that we will witness the PNG 50th anniversary, and after that, we will sit with the youth and community development office because we really need the establishment of the Youth Council in Wewak. We want an office for us, a body, where we youths can manage our own affairs.”
The team leader further highlighted that they believe youths can contribute significantly to the country's development; they need good support from local members, the national government, and the Department of Community Development, Youth, and Religion.
The Walkathon boys are in Central now, awaiting the 11 cycling members who are on their way. Once they arrive, they will together walk into Port Moresby ahead of PNG's 50th Independence Anniversary in September.
Meanwhile, a few members of the Wewak community, living in Port Moresby and led by Fidel Maury, paid a courtesy visit to the boys on Tuesday, showing their support.
Fidel noted that times have changed, and so has the attitude of the Youth. He said supporting the Wewak Youth during their walk will allow them to go back and change their district and province.
The Wewak Urban youth are grateful they are trekking for a great cause, and more so, along with PNG Soldiers of 1RPIR Taurama, who are reenacting the famous 1975 Exercise Antap Long Ol walk.
They urge youths throughout the country to stand up, establish a youth office in their respective provinces, and be the change in their community in the next 50 years."
A soldier’s son retraces dad’s historical walk,29/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5829,"Forty-nine years ago, seven-year-old Lionel Manuta stood beside his dad at the home of the 2nd Battalion Royal Pacific Island Regiment (2RPIR), Moem Barracks, watching 16 brave soldiers leave the barracks and ascend into the thick darkness of morning carrying with them a pre-independence message to Port Moresby.
Lionel waved at the soldiers and they waved back at him – silhouettes of waving hands in the dark. What he witnessed was the beginning of a 1200-kilometer walk led by Geoff Key - the walk called “Exercise Antap Long Ol”.
The 16 Second Battalion Pacific Island Regiment (2RPIR) soldiers brought with them letter(s) to the then chief minister, late Great Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, reaffirming that PNG soldiers were committed to a peaceful transition to independence.
Little did Lionel know that after 49 years he would embark on the same exercise, leading a team of his own. Major Lionel Manuta is now in charge of Combat Support Service Team (CSST) for the 2025 Exercise Antap Long Ol – a reenactment of the 1975 walk.
Major Manuta’s team takes care of logistics of the soldiers that are participating in this exercise. This historical exercise started in July with 2RPIR at Moem Barracks. They handed over the baton to Long Range Reconnaissance Unit (LRRU) and then the LRRU to 1RPIR who are now continuing the walk to Port Moresby.
Major Manuta recounts his 1975 experience: “My father was a soldier in Moem Barracks and I was a grade one student. I was so interested in the military, and my father asked me to see the soldiers walking up the range to Port Moresby. I asked him if he could take me up to see them (soldiers) starting the walk.”
“It was around 3 - 5 o'clock. I can't remember the time but it was early in the morning, that time I was around 7 years old and in grade one at Moem,” Major Manuta said. “I came with him (dad) at the battalion headquarter and I actually saw them walking out of the battalion headquarters, Moem Barracks. I waved at them, and they waved back. I actually witnessed that walk, that was way back in May, 1975.”
Major Manuta from, Deboin village, Tamata LLG, Sohe District, Northern Province, turned 58 while on this exercise. The CSST team, comprising four soldiers, celebrated his birthday in an eventful walk. He was grateful for the support he received from the team on his birthday, but even more grateful to have lived his dream as a soldier walking this historical walk.
Major Manuta and his logistics support team are with members of 1RPIR in Central Province. They are expected to arrive in Port Moresby on September 1, ahead of PNG Defense week leading into PNG’s 50th Independence Anniversary."

The Kimbe Port Redevelopment Project marks a PGK260 million infrastructure upgrade that promises to transform regional trade and connectivity.
The Kimbe Port project is the first of five major upgrades under the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP).
Future projects are planned for Oro Bay, Daru, Kavieng, and Lae ports.
The project reinforces Australia’s commitment to supporting PNG’s economic growth and regional connectivity, enhances infrastructure reliability, strengthens supply chain efficiency, improves connectivity, and boosts local economic opportunities.
Funded through a concessional loan from the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP) and delivered in partnership with PNG Ports Corporation Ltd, the redeveloped port is projected to handle over 600,000 tonnes of cargo annually by 2050, significantly boosting PNG’s palm oil export capacity.
Kimbe Port, first built in 1969, currently manages 75 per cent of PNG’s palm oil exports, valued at approximately PGK1 billion per year. The redevelopment will create up to 300 local jobs, with Pacific Marine Group Ltd handling marine works and Global Constructions Ltd leading PGK79 million in shore-based works.

Ewen McDonald, the event marked the start of construction on one of PNG’s most vital export hubs.
Minister Duma emphasized the long-term impact: “We’re not merely launching a construction project; we are laying the foundations for enhanced connectivity and prosperity for generations to come.”
High Commissioner McDonald added that the modern-day relationship is about supporting conditions for economic prosperity and that maritime infrastructure is important."
Turi issues tough measures to stop ethnic clash in the city,29/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5826,"NCD/Central Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi has issued tough directions to his police personnel to maintain presence in areas in the city known for ethnic clashes, especially at night and into the early morning hours.
Turi’s direction comes following a recent incident at the back of the eight-mile/nine-mile road, where a group of people was seen marching during a commotion.
He said this group were from the Hela province, who were demanding compensation following the death of one of their own during a recent ethnic clash between Eastern Highlanders and Southern Highlanders.
Police investigation revealed that a drunken brawl had erupted into a full-on ethnic clash between the two factions on Saturday, August 04th, 2025.
Following this big fight, Eastern Highlanders involved, raided residences of Southern Highlanders at the eight-mile settlement the next morning. During that episode, a father and his young son died when the house they were renting, was set on fire. The landlord, who is from Hela and a long-serving employee of the city authority, also died during that attack, after he was struck in the head with a stone.
The person who started the fight, an Eastern Highlander, was killed in the initial drunken brawl the day before. After the whole tragedy, the number of deaths is four.
Turi said, “We have seen on social media people marching.”
“These are Hela people demanding that the Eastern Highlanders and Southern Highlanders pay for the old man's death.
“Police were quick to respond to the situation and stop them because all of them are in mourning, and anything can happen.
“I gave them directions that (during) any fights, do not leave until peace is established, because most of the deaths were a result of early morning raids.
“These people know that when they attack during the day, police will have evidence, so they raid in the night to morning hours, making our job difficult to gather evidence,” he added.
Turi is reminding the highlands community that the city is not a warzone, and that there are avenues to resolve issues. Retaliation and killing is not the answer."

Discussions focused on disability inclusion, collaboration with police and medical services, and the importance of counselling and psychosocial support.
Despite limited resources, safe houses remain a lifeline for women and children in crisis. Presentations included findings from a national mapping of services and insights from grant partners trialing rapid response funds for emergency needs.
“This event gave us a space to talk openly about what’s working and where we face challenges,” said one safe house manager.
“Meeting others working in this space reminded me that I am not alone.”
The GBV Secretariat also shared progress on developing minimum standards for safe houses to improve service quality and consistency.
This gathering marks the first in a series of learning events aimed at co-creating local solutions to local challenges."
Emergency Nursing Leadership,28/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5819,"In improving healthcare in Papua New Guinea, nurses have taken the lead in delivering the country’s first all-nursing Basic Emergency Care (BEC) training course.
Held in Port Moresby from August 18–22, the course was taught entirely by nurses, for nurses, a first for the region.
Led by facilitators from Port Moresby General Hospital, National St John Ambulance PNG, and ANGAU Memorial Provincial Hospital, the training marks a major milestone in empowering PNG’s nursing workforce with life-saving emergency care skills.
The BEC course, developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM), equips frontline providers with a structured approach to managing acutely ill and injured patients in resource-limited settings.
Eighteen nursing leaders from 14 provinces participated, including representatives from nursing schools and the National Department of Health (NDOH), ensuring national alignment and reach.
These newly trained leaders are now positioned to cascade their skills across the country, expanding the impact of BEC training beyond the classroom.
“This is a good thing,” said Sr Wilma Sebby, PNG’s first nursing BEC Master Trainer. “We’re speaking the same language, and we know that nurses are the frontliners for any healthcare system.”
Sr Marcia Willie, BEC Course Coordinator, added, “BEC training improves our everyday practice and helps us follow a systematic approach when dealing with life-threatening conditions.
Teaching fellow nurses gives us confidence to reach more colleagues and train them to become BEC providers.”
The initiative is part of a partnership between the Regional Emergency and Critical Care Systems Strengthening Initiative (RECSI), WHO Collaborating Centre for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Development at the University of Technology Sydney, and the NDOH.
Supported by the Australian Government through the Partnerships for a Healthy Region initiative, the course was facilitated by RECSI’s implementing partner, National St John Ambulance PNG.
With 135 healthcare workers already trained in BEC across PNG, this nurse-led expansion signals a new era of leadership and resilience in emergency care."
Police ramp up security ahead of independence,28/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5816,"Over 1,000 police officers, both regular and reservists, will be providing security during Papua New Guinea’s 50th independence celebration.
NCD/Central Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi said this during an interview with this newsroom.
Turi said 500-plus police personnel will be from the regular police, and the other 500-plus are reservists.
He said the police officers will be patrolling the streets of Port Moresby starting this week, till the 50th anniversary celebration.
“NCD and Central Police will provide security around the city, but the inner security for guests and VIPs will be facilitated by the mobile squad, special service unit, and traffic unit,” he said.
Turi said NCD Governor Powers Parkop is fully supporting this police operation by providing six vehicles to assist the police with their work.
He thanked leaders from NCD and Central for their support, including the recent donation of two vehicles to the 15-mile and Sogeri police stations during the opening of the 15-mile police station yesterday.
Turi said these vehicles will also be used for the independence operations."
Madang emphasises need for child protection policies,28/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5813,"Protecting children from any form of oppression, suppression, and violence is everyone’s responsibility.
As a significant step forward, Madang Province awarded certificates of participation to 47 individuals who attended the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Child Protection System Strengthening Training at the Divine Word SVD Youth Centre Hall.
This achievement is notable because Madang is the first province to offer this training for social workers, facilitated by UNICEF.
The four-week training concluded last week, emphasising the need for improved policies and by-laws that could capture the protection of children in the country. Participants shared some of their challenges and accomplishments within their respective professions.
Theresa Kas, the Provincial Child Protection Consultant and also the Provincial Women’s Council President, was very outspoken about child issues in the province. Since there has been no proper coordination among stakeholders, challenges in gathering accurate statistics persist. However, she noted that only two provinces—Morobe and Enga—have fully established their Provincial Council for Children and Family Services, and she hopes Madang will also launch theirs in Bogia district before the year ends.
The participants were from various government and civil societies with the sole purpose of upskilling their knowledge and capacity in relation to child protection and child issues. Kas stressed that this is not the end and elaborated on the next phase of training, which will continue in the coming months.
Provincial Community Development advisor, Jubilee Dulau reminded participants that one way or another, their jobs were intertwined with children and their issues, and they must be prepared to address issues and be familiar with their partner sectors and the responses that would be undertaken.
To strengthen their system's network, they will still have to undergo and report a minimum of three cases that they have dealt with. These case studies are crucial in showing the stakeholders and facilitators that the training has been understood and would validate the training at a higher level. From there, they will later be awarded the actual training certificates.
Provincial administrator, Daniel Aloi reflected on this 50th Anniversary and spoke about how Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, during pre-independence, had a vision, and this included children who were not born yet. As he mentioned to our colonizers that the future of this country was with children who were babies and some were not even born yet.
Aloi stated that if moving forward, he would like to see a better plan and policy in place to protect women and especially children for the next 50 years.
He also emphasized that if policies were to be made, he would rather see that they truly have weight and meaning to be included and passed as law in parliament and not become one of the many “charity agenda” for women and children.
Government and civil participants included enforcement agencies, police, CIS, DJAG, Magisterial services, CWA, Madang Council of Women representatives from districts and provincial office, health sector, Persons with Disability, DWU staff, Catholic Archdiocese, Red Cross Madang, Faith-Based and non-government organizations, and the team from Community Development who, through their office made the training possible."
Major upgrade planned for airports,28/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5811,"Plans are underway for a major overhaul of key airports in the country, with a special focus on the Jacksons International Airport in Port Moresby.
Minister for Civil Aviation, Wake Goi, announced these plans. He said the upgrades are aimed at modernizing facilities, increasing capacity, and supporting the country's growing economy.
The project is broken down into five main priorities: runways, parking bays, infrastructure, the creation of an ""Airport City,"" and a general redesign of existing facilities.
Mr Goi said a top priority is the expansion of the runway at Jackson Airport.
“The plan involves adding two new runways alongside the existing one to ensure flights can continue without disruption during emergencies.
“This initiative was highlighted by a recent incident involving a Boeing 737 that experienced a tire issue upon landing.”
The project is expected to be offered to bidders for an estimated 200 to 300 billion Kina.
“Runways at other key airports, such as Mount Hagen, will also be improved to accommodate larger planes.”
He further clarified that the aircraft parking bay is also set for a significant expansion, with a projected bidding cost of 1 to 1.5 billion Kina.
This project will extend the parking area towards the Helifix area, which will require leveling part of a mountain.
The airport's infrastructure is slated for a complete modernization.
Plans include:
•	A new two-story building connecting the international and domestic terminals. Extending the VIP lounge by 20-30 meters and the economy lounge by a similar length.
•	Reorganizing the terminals to have check-in counters downstairs and departure gates upstairs.
•	Increasing the number of departure gates to 8 or 10.
•	Additionally, rundown buildings will be redesigned and relocated to give the airport a more professional appearance, with facilities like the maintenance hangar potentially being moved.
Minister Goi said a key part of the long-term vision is the development of an ""Airport City,"" an investment expected to be between 3 to 4 billion Kina.
He said this project aims to create a hub of hotels and shops extending as far as the Gateway Hotel, making access easier for travelers.
The National Airport Corporation (NAC) would manage the project by collecting taxes and leasing out land.
“The plan would allow investors who hold land titles to receive a percentage return on their investment, which the NAC could repay as it generates sufficient funds. One company has already shown interest by offering to transfer 4 billion Kina for the project,” Minister Goi added."
Indian exporters brace for introduction of US tariffs,28/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5810,"Indian exporters are bracing for a sharp decline in US orders after trade talks collapsed and Washington confirmed steep new tariffs on goods from the South Asian nation, escalating tension between the strategic partners.
Goods entering the United States will face an additional 25 per cent tariff from Wednesday, local time (1:31am AEST), taking some levies to 50 per cent.
US President Donald Trump announced the additional tariff in retaliation for New Delhi buying Russian oil, which has become a key funder of its war in Ukraine.
The two countries are yet to sign a new trade deal with the Trump administration.
""The government has no hope for any immediate relief or delay in US tariffs,"" a commerce ministry official told Reuters, who sought anonymity for lack of authorisation to speak to media.
Exporters hit by tariffs would receive financial assistance and be encouraged to diversify to alternative markets such as China, Latin America and the Middle East, the official added.
Exceptions are shipments in transit, humanitarian aid, and items under reciprocal trade programmes.
The Indian rupee fell to a three-week closing low of 87.68 against the dollar, despite recovering some ground after suspected central bank intervention to support it.
Wednesday's tariff move follows five rounds of failed talks, during which Indian officials had signalled optimism that tariffs could be capped at 15 per cent.
Officials on both sides blamed political misjudgement and missed signals for the breakdown in talks between the world's biggest and fifth-largest economies, whose two-way trade is worth more than $190 billion ($292 billion).
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have accused India of indirectly funding Russia's war against Ukraine by boosting Russian oil purchases.
This month Mr Bessent said India was profiteering from its sharply increased imports, making up 42 per cent of total oil purchases, versus less than 1 per cent before the war, in a shift Washington has called unacceptable.
The stand-off has raised questions about the broader relationship between India and the US, important security partners who share concerns about China.
However, on Tuesday, the US State Department and India's Ministry of External Affairs issued identical statements saying senior officials of the ministries and defence departments met virtually on Monday and expressed ""eagerness to continue enhancing the breadth and depth of the bilateral relationship"".
The statements said both sides looked forward to increasing defence cooperation and also discussed trade and investment, energy security, critical minerals exploration, and counter-narcotics and counterterrorism cooperation.
Both sides also reaffirmed their commitment to the Quad, a partnership that brings together the US and India with Australia and Japan.
It is supposed to meet at leader level later this year.
India has issued no directive yet on oil purchases from Russia. Companies will continue to buy oil based on economics, three refining sources said.

Youth Drive Bougainville Future,28/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5809,"Young innovators from across Bougainville took centre stage at Arawa’s Christmas Park early this month to mark International Youth Day (IYD), showcasing sustainable solutions and community-driven projects that are shaping the region’s future.
The event held on August 12, was organised by the Bougainville Youth Federation with support from the Bougainville Partnership program, funded by Australia and New Zealand, and brought together youth from all 17 districts, alongside students from Arawa Secondary School and Flexible Open Distance Education (FODE) centres.
This year’s IYD theme, “Local Youth Actions for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Beyond,” highlighted how Bougainvillean youth are blending innovation with tradition to tackle local challenges.
Among the standout presentations was the Siwai District Youth Association’s demonstration of organic poultry feed made from cassava, grated coconut, eggshells, and yams, an affordable, sustainable alternative for local farmers. They also revealed how wild taro leaves can boost egg production in layer hens.
Tinputz District Youth Association shared the success of their Savings and Loan Initiative, a micro-finance scheme born from financial literacy training, empowering young people to manage and grow their finances.
Other youth groups showcased organic coconut products and sustainable farming techniques, while cultural performances, including a show by the 2024 Bougainville Voice Xplosion winners, Cameroon Mukunu and Michael Dave, added vibrancy to the day.
Autonomous Bougainville Government Minister for Community Development, Morris Opeti, praised the youth for their creativity and acknowledged the ongoing support from Australia and New Zealand.
He also paid tribute to Dr Fiona Crockford, outgoing First Secretary of the Australian Development Assistance Office in Bougainville, for her dedication to youth-led initiatives."
Papa Buka makes PNG’s first Oscar submission,28/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5808,"Papua New Guinea has made history with the selection of Papa Buka as the country’s first-ever official entry to the 98th Academy Awards (Oscars), marking a milestone moment in national cinema and coinciding with PNG’s 50th year of independence.
The announcement was made by the Papua New Guinea Oscar Selection Committee, operating under the PNG Academy Awards Secretariat within the National Cultural Commission. The committee described the achievement as a proud reflection of PNG’s cultural identity and artistic voice on the global stage.
Directed by internationally acclaimed Indian filmmaker Dr. Biju, Papa Buka is co-produced by Papua New Guinean film producer Noelene Taula Wunum, alongside Indian producers Akshay Kumar Parija, Pa Ranjith, and Prakash Bare. The film is described as a groundbreaking feature that captures PNG’s rich cultural heritage, powerful storytelling traditions, and cinematic potential.
Dr. Don Niles, Chairman of the PNG Oscar Selection Committee, said the decision came after a rigorous evaluation process.
“This is a historic moment for Papua New Guinea cinema. Papa Buka embodies our stories, our traditions, and our artistic voice, and we are proud to present it to the world through the Academy Awards platform,” Dr. Niles said.
The film’s selection underscores growing recognition of PNG’s creative industries and cultural contributions internationally. For Wunum, who is part of the production team based in PNG, the selection highlights the opportunities for local filmmakers to showcase their work globally.
The PNG Oscar Selection Committee, officially recognized under the National Culture Commission, reviews eligible films annually and selects one to represent the nation in the International Feature Film category. This year, Papa Buka stood out as the production that best represented the identity and creativity of the nation.
The nomination is seen not only as a cinematic breakthrough but also as a symbol of pride for the people of PNG. It offers the chance for the world to experience Papua New Guinea’s stories and traditions through film—something many believe is long overdue.
If successful in progressing further at the Academy Awards, Papa Buka could open doors for more PNG filmmakers and inspire future generations in the country’s growing film industry."

New police offices in Kokopo,28/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5806,"The PNG-Australia Policing Partnership opened an extended regional and provincial police headquarters at Ralum, in Kokopo, East New Britain Province, yesterday (August 27).
The extension works cost the Australian Federal Police K3.2 million, and includes the upgrading of the ground floor of the building and the construction of new office spaces upstairs.
PNG-APP assistant commissioner, Jamie Strauss, said the three new office spaces cater for the provincial Royal PNG Constabulary (RPNGC) administration office, aimed at enhancing service delivery, as well as an APP office for both Australian and locally engaged staff, and an ICT office to advance digital connectivity and capability of the RPNGC.

Under the PNG-APP program, a 40-man and 20-woman quarter will be constructed respectively at the Baliora police barracks. This is to be completed by October 2025.
Strauss outlined that this partnership was established after the signing of a bilateral security agreement between the two governments of PNG and Australia.
“Since then, the AFP has been able to expand its footprint across PNG, so we now have members based in Kokopo and Mt Hagen as well, apart from Lae and Port Moresby.
“Ceremonies like today, are part of the benefits of having our people in those locations. Because we are on the ground and can expand and support you in the job that you need to do for PNG citizens.”
ENB Provincial Police Commander, Chief Inspector Felix Nebanat, acknowledged the presentation of a 24-foot fully-kitted banana boat that will assist the police in the province to service the coastal areas.
“This boat will be given to the Kokopo police station, to police the islands, as well as the Pomio district, if we need to. We still need sea policing in other parts of the province, along the north coast going up to the West New Britain provincial border,” he said.
The boat is also funded under the PNG-APP program at a cost of K140,000.
In acknowledging the support from the PNG-APP, ENB Provincial Member (Governor), Michael Marum, said this is an important milestone for policing in the province.

Blue licenses for Madang police officers,27/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5799,"It was an accomplishment for the Madang police command as 37 participants underwent two weeks of training to gain their blue licenses on Friday the 22nd.
This is the second Royal PNG Constabulary National Centre of Excellence nationwide Permit Program on basic driving after Milne Bay province, for police officers to attain blue licenses in order to drive police marked vehicle.
Over the years, the course on basic driving and issuing of permits was an inclusive bundle for new police recruits at the Bomana National Centre of Excellence (NCoE), however, over the years when situations plummeted it was plucked out by former instructors leaving thousands of police men and women driving without blue licenses nationwide.
Senior Daniel Apuau the Manager of the driving school of NCoE, said it was upon request by Madang PPC that the team from Port Moresby flew in to conduct the permit program.
He hopes the hierarchy can realize the importance of this program and support financially so that it can be rolled out thoroughly in all 22 provinces for police men and women.
Director for Training and person in charge of Advanced Skills Superintendent Charlie Sare, congratulated the 37 participants are from within the province. He thanked them for their effort and challenged them to take ownership of the vehicles ensuring that they do not endanger or risk lives of others, passengers, family members and ruin the vehicle because of reckless driving.
Sare urged them to be mindful and added that more programs are likely to be rolled out in future when funding is confirmed.
Superintendent Steven Bunga the Director Corporate Services emphasized on the importance of having these courses available for officers. He also said the permits will also serve as a safeguard for officers, especially in the event when there is an accident involving a police vehicle.
Superintendent Bunga reiterated on self-discipline whilst holding onto police vehicles and urged them to be better role models for the communities at large. He stated that it was a tool given to utilize in handling their roles and responsibilities as police officers while using police vehicle.

"East Sepik Education improving, says Bird",27/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5797,"We are not number one, we are not doing brilliantly, but in terms of the current measurement system, we've improved a lot in East Sepik Province. These were the words of East Sepik Provincial Member, Allan Bird.
After a decade, the province has experienced a significant change in school rankings. Bird believes East Sepik has improved its education standards. He said several schools in the province have risen from no ranking to become among the top 10 schools in the country, attributing this change to the reforms recently implemented.
“In 2017, we had a lot of parents complaining that a lot of kids in 2016 and 2017 were not making it to tertiary institutions.
“Last year, ESP had three schools in the top 10 in Papua New Guinea. That's from zero in 2017, now we have three. So, in the top 20, we've probably got about eight schools in the top 20. In West Sepik, you've got two schools. So out of the top 10 schools in the country, five of them are in the Sepik region.”
Bird stated that, while there is a long way to go in improving the quality of education for children in the province, the number of students from ESP selected for tertiary education has increased dramatically.
He said he knows many children are selected for tertiary education, because the number of students qualifying for the Tertiary Fee Subsidy this year is the highest since they started the program seven years ago. A 60 per cent increase from 2018.
“So, we've come a long way in education. The people working in education understand the vision. And we're still doing a lot in education.”
Bird added that health services have also improved during his term in office. From the province being ranked 21 out of 22 provinces in the country, health services have improved and are now ranked 11 out of 22 provinces.
“We're not number one, we're not doing brilliantly, but in terms of the current measurement system, we've improved a lot, and we still have a long way to go.”"
OTML Training Opportunities Expand in Western,27/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5793,"Students of Morehead Vocational Centre in South Fly District, Western Province, have the opportunity to gain hands-on industry experience with Ok Tedi Mining Limited (OTML) following the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement earlier this month.
The partnership marks a breakthrough for the institution, addressing long-standing challenges students faced in securing practical placements — a crucial requirement for their career readiness.
Morehead Vocational manager, Ken Ware Potang, described the agreement as life-changing. “This collaboration marks a pivotal moment for Morehead Vocational Centre and a tremendous blessing to our 229 students and the broader South Fly community,” he said.
“Ok Tedi is not just rescuing Morehead Vocational; they are also securing the future of our students.”
Ok Tedi’s Training Department manager, Ian Strachan, reaffirmed the company’s commitment to building PNG’s workforce. “Through this agreement, Ok Tedi is dedicated to facilitating vocational training for our students, ensuring they acquire practical experience that equips them for their future careers,” he said.
The initiative makes Morehead the second vocational school, after Kiunga, to be onboarded into OTML’s training programs, including apprenticeships, graduate development, and industrial training.
This collaboration is expected to create lasting benefits by fostering skills, opportunities, and community growth in Western Province."
Funding limits ESP students’ access,27/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5791,"Secondary school students need access to information if they are to make informed career choices.
However, funding limitation has prevented more upper secondary schools in East Sepik from participating in the province’s second career expo that was recently held in Wewak.
East Sepik Province hosted its second career expo at the Mercy Secondary Technical School in Wewak, where more than 300 Grade 12 students attended the three-day event.
Out of the 20 secondary and technical schools in ESP, 13 participated, travelling from schools such as Passam School of Excellence and the secondary schools of Maprik, Dreikikir and Angoram.
East Sepik’s guidance officer, Melissa Basho, said their first expo in 2024 had 14 schools involved.
“The rest – because of distance and funding – they didn’t make it,” said Basho.
“Likewise, this year as well, the principals said that they have a shortage in TFF funding this year so for the schools that are outside, because I’m organising this event, I cannot look after the students.
“If they bring students out, they need to have lunch provided, transport for them to come; everything needs money.
“That’s why for this year, I believe I will have not more than 13; last year was a good turnout because principals had money and they were able to bring their students.”
Tertiary institutions that travelled into the province for the expo included the University of Goroka, the Papua New Guinea University of Technology from Lae, who set up along with the University of PNG, Divine Word University’s Kaindi campus, Mapex, and other technical schools.
“Information is power. If big institutions outside the province could come and give them firsthand information, that would be very helpful,” highlighted Ms Basho.
Deputy principal academic of Maprik Secondary School, Molland Saluali, said they received valuable information on the different courses and requirements from the tertiary institutions.
“This career expo has enlightened some of my students, especially with areas that they have doubts over, like courses offered not only at Unitech but the other institutions as well,” Saluali stated.
“It helped us to identify the course and the criteria, what is required to get into the institutions. It also helped us to understand the processes that the students will go through to get into the institutions.
“Over the years, we have experienced a lot of hiccups, especially with the students’ choices. But after going through this, I think we are in a better position to make good decisions on their choices.”
Saluali said the information they have received will be shared with the students and teachers who were not able to attend, with him adding that the expo needs to be hosted annually."
SP Brewery Signs GBV Training Partnership,27/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5789,"SP Brewery has taken another major step in the fight against gender-based violence (GBV) by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on August 25th with the National GBV Secretariat, the Department for Community Development & Religion, and the Somare Institute of Leadership & Governance (SILAG).
Managing Director Ed Weggemans described the partnership as a bold move. “It gives me great pleasure to speak at this very important moment; the signing of a MoU Partnership between SP Brewery, the National Gender Based Violence Secretariat, the Department for Community Development & Religion, and the Somare Institute of Leadership & Governance (SILAG).”
Since October 2024, SP Brewery has been part of NGBVS-sanctioned events under its Anti-Violence Campaign, gaining insights into the scale of GBV across the country. Mr. Weggemans said these engagements shaped the company’s decision to use its SP Lager brand to speak out against violence.
He stressed the initiative is timely as Papua New Guinea approaches its 50th Independence. “We believe investment in a GBV training program to train human resources will add value to the important work of the Secretariat and Government policy and contribute immensely towards delivering effective community prevention programs.”
SP Brewery has partnered with SILAG since 2017 to train over 200 public servants in leadership and governance. Building on this model, the new MoU aims to deliver specialized GBV training aligned with national policy.
Mr. Weggemans concluded, “Moving forward, we envision a robust partnership… not only to deliver a comprehensive GBV training program that inspires behavioural change, but also to inspire other corporates and organizations to forge such partnerships and take an explicit stand against violence.”"

ENB community set date to celebrate ‘Ward Day’,27/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5787,"The Mioko Virian Ward in the Duke of York Islands in East New Britian Province has become the first ward in the province to have a ward flag and a ward logo following its launch recently.
Speaking at the official program, Governor Marum commended the community for launching their ward flag, ward logo and declaring 19th July as Ward Day – to be celebrated annually as a symbol of unity, identity, and progress.
He noted the important role of Mioko Virian in the history of East New Britain and Papua New Guinea, and called for unity among leaders, families, churches, women, and youth as the nation prepares to celebrate 50 years of Independence.

PNGSDP provides program updates to stakeholders,27/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5786,"Leaders in Western Province have commended the PNG Sustainable Development Program for taking time to provide updates to them on the work they are doing in the province.
Middle Fly District Administrator Petrus Malongim commended PNGSDP during its 2024 Program Update last week in Kiunga, saying the approach demonstrates transparency, accountability, and a genuine commitment to partnership.
He said presenting updates at the provincial level provides stakeholders a clear picture of SDP’s work across the Western Province and opens the door for collaboration in its plans across the four districts.
“It gives a clear idea of where your footprints are and your plans going into the future in terms of covering all districts in the province,” he said.
He also expressed his plans to partner with SDP to establish basic infrastructure that would enable the delivery of health and education in Middle Fly District.
The Kiunga Program Update held on August 20 follows an earlier session held in Daru on August 6. These updates provide key stakeholders with visibility of SDP’s 2024 activities, reinforcing the organisation’s commitment to being accountable to the people of Western Province.
District leaders called for stronger and closer partnerships to create greater impact with development partners.
A key takeaway from the Daru 2024 program update was the request for SDP to establish a stakeholder working group, a forum to align efforts and drive lasting change together.
SDP Chief Executive Officer Lesieli Taviri said the program update is part of SDP’s commitment to share important achievements of the program with leaders and the people of Western Province, on the work done in the communities throughout 2024.
“Our program updates are about good stewardship and keeping us accountable. We want to make sure our stakeholders have visibility of the work we are doing, the progress we’ve made, and the lessons we are learning along the way,” Ms Taviri said.
“We are encouraged by the recognition of the work we are doing and excited about the opportunity to build stronger partnerships with our stakeholders, because partnership is how we achieve real impact for Western Province,” she added.
The Daru and Kiunga session followed the Annual Report Meeting in Port Moresby in June this year."
What is National Repentance Day?,26/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5785,"This year marks 14 years since the first Repentance Day was observed following the gazettal of this day as a public holiday and the announcement by then Prime Minister Peter O’Neill in 2011.
According to news records available online, the decision to declare August 26th as the National Repentance Day came about following requests by leaders of various churches to formally recognize the informal National Day of Prayer as a public holiday where the whole nation participates in prayer and seek God’s forgiveness and favour upon Papua New Guinea.
This is what Pastor Jack Edwards of Shema Evangelism Ministry told the ABC news back in 2011 during the inaugural National Repentance Day.
“Basically a time when we ask the people of our nation to come together and pray and ask the Lord to forgive us for the wrongs that are happening in our nation,"" he said.
""So everybody can find time to go to a church and pray, or if they [are not] able to, then stay back in their house and also pray for the country.""
Now part of the calendar of events for PNG, August 26th brings together people of all walks of life to fulfill this – pray and seek God’s forgiveness.
It is on this day that Prime Minister James Marape, upon taking office in 2019 just three months earlier, took to the podium to pray and repent on behalf of the nation.
“I pray for curse to anyone occupying public office – from the highest in Prime Minister’s office (crowds cheering), down to every public service occupation. And I am speaking on your behalf because pastors will speak on behalf of their congregation. I am speaking as the head of the national executive - I pray for curse.”
Part of the prime minister’s speech on National Repentance Day in 2019.
His words have been the subject of criticism over the years, with some critics and commentators linking this to the state of the country – the low social indicators, the corruption, the inflation, the law-and-order problems an so forth, blaming this downward performance to the curse.
The prime minister was also questioned in parliament by the Member for North Fly, James Donald – who also played the recording in parliament - early this month and asked to withdraw his words.
However, the prime minister defended his comments saying, “I pronounced curse on the practice of corruption, which is totally different from curse to the country.”
“The country was never cursed and will never be cursed.”
“If you look at the full text, I said corruption, which also means to me and my family.
“What do you expect the leader of a country to do? To allow and not condemn corruption?” he asked in response.
Despite these criticisms, the National Repentance Day is a national gazetted public holiday and will continue to be observed year in, year out.
This year’s National Repentance Day is quite important as it falls just three weeks before the country celebrates its 50th year of Independence.
And with the Gospel Band, Sinach in the country and the atmosphere reverend following a weekend of Jubilee Reset Concert, many turned up at the Sir John Guise Stadium early this morning to observe this day.
Prime Minister James Marape reminded citizens of the guiding principles of the constitution that are based on Christian Ways.
“Our forefathers placed this nation under the guidance of God when they raised the flag on Independence Hill in 1975,” he said.
“As a Christian people, we are accountable to God in the way we live, in the way we govern, and in the way we treat each other.
Repentance Day is therefore not just a public holiday, but a sacred day for us to humble ourselves, to say sorry for our wrongs, and to commit ourselves to a new way of living.”
“This day compels us to pause and reflect — to acknowledge where we have fallen short in our personal lives, in our communities, and as a country,” he said. “We must say sorry to God and to one another, and make a conscious pledge not to deliberately repeat the same mistakes. That is the true meaning of repentance — not just words, but a change of heart, a change of attitude, and a change of conduct.”"
UN Secretary General to spend four days in PNG,26/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5784,"The United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, will visit Papua New Guinea from Tuesday, 2 September to Friday, 5 September 2025, as part of the nation’s 50th Independence Anniversary commemorations.
The Prime Minister said this will be the first time a UN Secretary-General will spend four consecutive days in Papua New Guinea.
“Fifty years on, this is the first time ever that a United Nations Secretary-General has come to our country. And it is not just a fly-in, fly-out visit, but a four-day stay – something quite unprecedented for the Secretary-General in any single location globally,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“This visit is a profound honour for our people. The Secretary-General’s presence demonstrates recognition of Papua New Guinea’s consistent respect for democracy, individual freedoms, human rights, and peacebuilding since Independence.”
He highlighted that the visit will also acknowledge the Bougainville Peace Agreement of 30 August 2001, a landmark in peace and reconciliation, and Papua New Guinea’s role in maintaining peace and unity within its diverse communities.
During his stay, Secretary-General Guterres will:
• Call on the Governor-General, the Head of State, and meet with Prime Minister Marape.
• Address the National Parliament on Wednesday, 3 September.
• Travel to Mt Hagen in the Highlands on Thursday to witness community peace initiatives and visit forest areas that showcase Papua New Guinea’s rich biodiversity.
• Return to Port Moresby on Friday before departing that afternoon.
Prime Minister Marape said the Secretary-General is expected to speak on Papua New Guinea’s global significance as one of the world’s great biodiversity hubs, and to recognise the nation’s leadership in environmental stewardship and sustainable development.
“This September will be a momentous month. As we celebrate 50 years of Independence, we are humbled that global leaders, including the UN Secretary-General and His Royal Highness Prince Edward, will join us.
Their presence affirms that Papua New Guinea is not isolated, but a respected member of the international community,” Prime Minister Marape said.
He urged Papua New Guineans to unite in dignity and respect as the country welcomes international guests during this historic golden jubilee."
23 police executives sign employment contracts,26/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5782,"23 police executives have signed their employment contract, signifying their commitment and leadership to the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary.
Initially, 25 were supposed to sign their contracts; however, two did not make it.
They range from the ranks of Deputy Commissioners of Police, Assistant Commissioners for Police, Metropolitan, Directors, and Provincial Police Commanders.
Police Commissioner David Manning initiated the three-year contract signing ceremony today Port Moresby.
In his opening remarks, Manning said these officers have signed the contract based on their performance, commitment, and dedication to the RPNGC.
Manning said the lack of good leadership is a major concern in the police force, something these leaders must take into consideration and improve in their respective commands.
“Lack of engaged leadership is what we are subject to, turning in late at work and leaving early are some of the behaviors police executives are practicing in the force. This shows that you no longer feel the edge of responsibility for your command.”
He urged the officers to perform to the best of their ability, as their performance will be monitored starting today.
“Our men and women expect competent leadership; provide that leadership when you go out there to serve our people, “ Manning added.
Northern Command Commander ACP Peter Guinness, who spoke on behalf of the executives, thanked Manning for recognizing their efforts in providing policing services to the people of PNG.
Guinness said that as they take on this role as leaders of the RPNGC, they carry on the responsibility to be agents of change in the police force."
PM stresses message of forgiveness on Repentance Day,26/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5781,"Prime Minister James Marape has urged all Papua New Guineans to see today (National Repentance Day) as a time of reflection, forgiveness, renewal, and a reset of true Christian character before God and each other, especially as the country prepares to mark its 50th Independence Anniversary next month.
With the nation’s golden jubilee only three weeks away, Prime Minister Marape said this year’s Repentance Day carries even greater significance.
“In just three weeks, Papua New Guinea will turn 50. We must ask ourselves: What have we done with the gift of independence entrusted to us by our forefathers? Have we honoured God? Have we honoured one another?”
He added: “As we prepare to celebrate 50 years of independence on 16 September 2025, let us use this Repentance Day to say sorry for the wrongs of the last 49 years, to forgive each other, and to make a firm resolution to enter the next 50 years with clean hearts and renewed minds.”
He further reflected: “The Scripture in Leviticus 25:8–10 speaks of a national reset after 49 years, a time of restoration and renewal. As we now step into our 50th year, let us follow this divine instruction — to reflect deeply, renew our characters, and commit ourselves to a fresh beginning for Papua New Guinea.”
Prime Minister Marape reminded citizens that since 1975, Papua New Guinea has always declared its identity as a Christian nation.
“Our forefathers placed this nation under the guidance of God when they raised the flag on Independence Hill in 1975,” he said.
“As a Christian people, we are accountable to God in the way we live, in the way we govern, and in the way we treat each other.

“We must say sorry to God and to one another, and make a conscious pledge not to deliberately repeat the same mistakes.
That is the true meaning of repentance — not just words, but a change of heart, a change of attitude, and a change of conduct.”
He also highlighted that the 10 Commandments, given by God as the moral foundation for humanity, provide a clear guide for the nation’s renewal.
“The first four commandments remind us to love and honour God above all else. The remaining six guide us to live rightly with our fellow human beings. If we hold to these simple truths, we will eliminate corruption, violence, and lawlessness from our homes, communities, and country,” he said.
“The easiest yet most powerful contribution each of us can make to Papua New Guinea is to live with respect — respect for God, respect for our fellow man, and respect for our nation’s laws.”
The Prime Minister concluded with a strong call for unity, forgiveness, and the renewal of national character: “If every citizen of this nation honours God and respects their neighbour, there will be no corruption, no gender-based violence, no tribal fighting, no abuse of law, and no destruction of property. Instead, there will be peace, unity, prosperity, and the blessing of God over our country.
“I urge all Papua New Guineans — leaders and citizens alike — to take this Repentance Day seriously. Let us reflect, forgive, and recommit ourselves to God, to each other, and to our nation."

Dregerhafen issues continue,26/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5771,"The former school of some of our founding fathers in Finschhafen, the Dregerhafen Technical Secondary School, has become a pitfall in secondary education; a stark contrast to the pre-independence era.
Ward 10 councillor in Heldsbach, Okacne Narekine, highlighted that for the past five years, most of their students have given up and returned home due to the constant fighting. This directly leads to an increase in unemployment and social disorder.
Narekine pointed out that while Finschhafen holds historical significance in terms of it being the landing place of the first Lutheran missionary in Papua New Guinea in 1886, and being a thriving economic and agricultural hub for the country in its early days, decades of neglect have led to a regressive state.
“Dregerhafen secondary is the only secondary school within Finschhafen district,” stated Cr Narekine. “There are lower secondary schools like Hube’s Pindiu Agro High School and the newly-established Burum High School and Dreger high school. For upper secondary, we only have Dregerhafen.”
“The main problem we are facing now is that, most of our kids who were at Dreger, are now back at home with us because of school fighting.
“School fighting has been continuous and has affected our children. For instance, Sattelberg circuit is a circuit within the Lutheran church that looks after Het Mape – which is Mape LLG under the government – and the entire Sattelberg and one parish under Tewai-Siassi district.
“This year and in the previous years, not one student from this circuit had successfully passed to university. And that’s a major problem.”
Cr Narekine outlined that since the Early Childhood and Junior Primary Teachers Training Centre has moved its students to Wampar, in Huon Gulf district, the teaching facilities are now free. He therefore suggested that the church support them and establish a secondary school for the circuit and surrounding areas at Heldsbach.
Former Yangpela Didiman extension coordinator, Hune Made, believes that reviving the agricultural program at Heldsbach would create a pathway for the many unemployed youth. He says this is the best approach to utilising our youth and keeping them busy in the rural districts instead of letting them drift to urban areas.
Meantime, Narekine, who is also a member of the Finschhafen District Development Authority, said a memorandum of understanding was signed with ELCPNG in June 2023.
“The first K100,000 was given to the church to conduct a land survey here at Heldsbach,” he continued. “The main idea is that, because this property belongs to the church, the DDA will not step in unless the church gives its approval.”
“FDDA has its eyes on the Heldsbach facilities but under the MoU, K500,000 will be paid to the church to conduct surveys, then divide the land areas; authorising the FDDA to develop an allocated portion.
“The first payment has already been made; hence the process is underway.”"

DoWH and GGGI officers receive certificates,25/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5767,"Sixteen Department of Works and Highways officers and two Global Green Growth Institute officers were certified after completing four days of training to enhance their technical skills in climate risk integration for road infrastructure planning and design.
The Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS) PNG Project, in collaboration with the Department of Works and Highways (DoWH) and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), hosted the Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (CRVA) Foundation Training certificate presentation and South Knowledge Exchange debrief at the DoWH Conference Room in Port Moresby on Friday, August 22, 2025.
Supported by the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) through the Infrastructure Resilience Accelerator Fund (IRAF), the IRIS PNG Project is strengthening Papua New Guinea’s institutional and technical capacity for climate-resilient transport infrastructure development.
As part of this effort, a foundational CRVA training was delivered from August 11 – 14, 2025 for 16 DoWH officers and two GGGI officers.
DoWH Secretary, Gibson Holemba challenged the participants to use the skills and knowledge gained from the training to make an impact.
“This small but very significant event shows that you are the champion of the Climate Resilient Programme that we are conducting in the Department. Ensure that these certificates (skills) can translate from the 4-day workshop to 4 years or so of your employment with impact. I now challenge you all to become the champion of the Climate Vulnerability Assessment in the Department to pass on the knowledge to the person sitting next to you or down the line.
GGGI PNG Country Representative, Mohammad Ali Shaikh highlighted the importance of capacity building in achieving the project’s goal of increasing access to knowledge, resources, and standards for resilient and inclusive infrastructure.
“Today’s certificate presentation and knowledge exchange debrief mark a significant step forward our shared journey toward resilient and climate-proof infrastructure in Papua New Guinea. At GGGI, we believe that true resilience begins with local capacity. By equipping DoWH officers with the technical knowledge to integrate climate risk into road planning, we are not only strengthening institutions but also enabling solutions that will stand the test of time, disaster, and climate change. The South-South collaboration with New Zealand offers a unique opportunity to deepen learning, exchange best practices, and build a stronger, climate-resilient future for PNG.”
The next phase of the project includes a South-South Knowledge Exchange visit to Auckland, New Zealand, from August 23 – 30, 2025, bringing together officials from DoWH, the Climate Change Development Authority (CCDA), and GGGI to learn from regional best practices and foster collaboration on resilient infrastructure development."
DWU celebrate two more upstanding alumni,25/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5766,"Eddie Tanago Paine and Josiah Pup Moiya were the proud recipients of the Divine Word University 2025 Alumni of the year award. Both were recognized during DWU’s celebration of its Foundation Day on Thursday 21st August. Paine and Moiya are former students who attained bachelors in PNG and International Relations Studies under the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. They graduated in 2008 and 2017 respectively.
DWU President Professor Fr. Philip Gibbs said every year the Alumni never ceases to amaze with undeniable traits that bring forward positive change and development into the country, a reflection of the institution’s legacy and rapport.
Moiya is an entrepreneur from the Western Highlands province, currently providing employment opportunities from his security firm, Armed Seal Group which has now spanned into four key industries of security, construction, finance and real-estate.
Despite graduating with a Bachelors in PNG Studies, Pup did not wait for employment, but rather created it. Since then, he has expanded his business from Mt Hagen to Jiwaka and Chimbu, and plans to expand into Lae, Madang and Port Moresby. His story resounds of grit and determination in today’s society where graduates outnumber job opportunities. His story is about social purpose - to be the solution, especially for those society often overlooks. He actively supports local churches, helps fund community development efforts, and personally pays school fees for children from struggling families as an investment in a better PNG, rather than as a charity case.
For the Campaign Manager for ACT NOW PNG, it was always about doing the right thing. Mr. Paine is a leading voice in PNG’s civil society landscape, known nationally and internationally for his tireless work defending customary land rights, promoting environmental justice, and championing ethical development. He is one of PNG’s most vocal advocates and leads efforts to expose land and forest exploitation, particularly the abuse of Special Agriculture and Business Leases (SABL) and Forest Clearing Authorities, which have stripped communities of their land and resources without consent.
Recently this year, Mr. Paine became a public figure in the defence of civic space after a criminal charge—widely seen as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP)—was dismissed by the courts. The case, stemming from his role in raising public awareness about forestry malpractice, served to underline his unwavering stand for truth and public interest.
The DWU Alumnae awards are given each year to nominees who have had an outstanding impact within their professional career space. It is also a recognition of the practiced values instilled by Divine Word University, provoking development and positive impact in the country or internationally.
After the formalities, both awardees’ names were unveiled at the Alumnae Park amongst other names of recognized alumnae."
Renewed commitment to human dignity,25/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5765,"Conversations deepen for Gender based violence, sorcery accusation-related violence, family protection and child rights, gender equality, and the rights of persons with disabilities with the launch of the National Human Rights Strategy 2024-2029 in Port Moresby recently.
Secretary for the Department of Justice and Attorney General Dr Eric Kwa, said the strategy is aligned with the Medium-Term Development Plan IV, particularly strategic priority area 5 on law and justice.
Over the years, steps have been taken to address critical issues such as gender-based violence, sorcery accusation-related violence, family protection, child rights, gender equality, and the rights of persons with disabilities. This strategy builds on those efforts and places human rights at the heart of national priorities.
According to the Secretary for the Department of Justice and Attorney General Dr Eric Kwa, the strategy ensures greater access to justice for vulnerable groups, including women, children, persons with disabilities, people in rural areas, and those who are socially and economically disadvantaged.
Secretary Kwa said a human rights secretariat has been established under the justice department’s corporate plan 2019 to 2024. The secretariat has three major responsibilities to establish a policy, push for the human rights institute, and promote the human rights agenda.
“Looking back in history, we realized we did not have a permanent place for the human rights secretariat and the work on human rights, so we offered as a department to take on the responsibility to work on the human rights institute and the strategic. Since 2020, we've been slowly establishing the human rights secretariat made up of like-minded individuals who have performed extremely well. A result of their hard work is seen through the launching of the human rights strategy,” he said.
Dr Kwa added that the launching of the strategic plan marks the beginning of a renewed national commitment to human dignity, reflecting Papua New Guinea’s constitutional values, and ensures the state fulfills its duty as the primary guardian of rights."

He noted that the upcoming Independence celebrations, which involve increased movement of people, also pose a potential risk. Health teams will collaborate with the Education Department to visit schools, targeting children under the age of 10 for vaccinations.
Provincial Administrator Aloi thanked Dr Daimen and his team for being proactive and preparing a detailed budget to guide the support. He acknowledged that health indicators in Madang remain low and require urgent improvement, particularly with immunization coverage which stands at 49%.
“I know of compulsory vaccination that should be given to our children, and I believe the little support can facilitate some of these vaccinations for our children.” Mr Aloi said.
He added that while the support is not tied to any specific program, he trusted MPHA to use it wisely, particularly to ensure compulsory vaccinations for children.
Dr Daimen reiterated the importance of the polio vaccination campaign and urged parents to ensure all children under 10 are vaccinated against the disease."

The elites convened on Thursday, August 21, at the Unagi Oval in Port Moresby to air their grievances and issue a call for normalcy.
According to Peace Community spokesperson Jack Junior Imbu the civil unrest started due to an attack on the Minister and MP for Wapenamanda Miki Kaeok, who was at the district on duty travel.
MP Kaeok’s tribesman, from the Yangekun tribe, then retaliated against the Yakuman tribe who are believed to have been behind the attack.
A man from Yangekun lost his life, while properties, including the house of MP Kaeok were destroyed.
“We condemn the killing and condemn the attack on the innocent properties of the MP and the properties of those affected.
“This tribal warfare has destroyed the livelihood of the Wapenamanda people, and we are fed up with this,” he said.
Imbu said the elites have put forward three agendas: effective government support through a state of emergency, MP Kaeok to take ownership and leadership to stop his people from fighting, and all church leaders to take the lead to stop this tribal warfare."

Free carry equity for Cloudy Bay,23/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5749,"For the first time ever since the inception of the Papua New Guinea Forest Authority 33 years ago, the forestry sector is in the process of issuing a timber permit to be managed under Forest Management Agreement, to state-owned company - PNG Diwai Holdings Limited (PNGDHL), the authority’s business arm.
The PNGDHL will be the developer for the Amau Ganai Riwari FMA Project in the Cloudy Bay area of Central Province with the company to free carry equity for the resource owners, another first in the forestry sector. The project is a pilot with plans to replicate this method of project delivery in other areas if proven successful.
PNGFA Managing Director John Mosoro officially opened the project negotiations between PNGFA, PNGDHL and the resource owners, on Friday, 15th August, 2025. Mr Mosoro who is also PNGDHL’s Interim Executive Chairman described the occasion as historic.
“As the PNGFA Managing Director, it gives me great pleasure to stand before you all to officially open negotiations for the Amau Ganai Riwari FMA which will be the first project to be funded by the government through PNGDHL,” he said. “This idea for the government to manage its own projects started while I was the Director for Policy at the Prime Minister’s Department and we moved it to PNGFA.”
“PNGDHL is now a fully-fledged company established under the business law of the country.
Addressing the resource owners, he said, “For the first time in any PNG forestry project, you will sign with the State.”
Previously, the State signed with developers, while the resource owners were mere spectators, but in this instance, State will sign with the resource owners.
PNGDHL Chief Operating Officer Verolyn Daugil said, “This is the first time for a state company in the forestry sector to take up a project and history in the making for the sector that it will free carry the resource owners’ equity in the project, which will see majority of the benefits go to the resource owners.”
The whole-day project negotiations took place after four weeks of consultation between PNGFA and the resource owners. Prior to this, the authority through its Forest Acquisition and Allocations Directorate has for over two years been working with the resource owners, leading up to Friday’s negotiations.
Mr. Mosoro said, “This is a first for the forestry sector since the 1992 Forestry Act.
“PNGDHL will now go into equity participation for landowners. You will get your royalties and levies but PNGDHL will free carry your equity, so you will have shares in PNGDHL, as added benefits.
“We started with a project in Central Province because it is easy to go back and forth to sort out issues that may arise. I hope that when other resource owners throughout the country see the success of this project, they will want to participate also.
“Today is a very important occasion for the government, PNG and the landowners now that we will involve landowners meaningfully in the development of their forest resources. This is how we will take back PNG in the forest sector by ensuring meaningful participation by landowners as the government implements its policies down to ground level.
“I thank the National Forest Board and Minister Waipo for agreeing for this project to be the first for resource owners to sign with the state. This is a historical moment.
“I want this project to be unique and different from the rest that have been signed with other developers in the past. The negotiations must ensure resource owners get maximum benefit,” MD Mosoro told the meeting.
Mr. Miller Bonou, the Chairman for Amau Ganai and the landowner representative who spoke during the occasion was happy with this new development saying: “Life in our area is very difficult. We are still living like our forefathers. I have been talking with PNGFA about this project for the last five years and am happy for the negotiations today. We need basic services.”
Deputy District Administrator for Abau Mr. Trevor Tararau in support of Mr. Bonou said: “Our people need development in the districts. It’s 50 years since our country’s independence and we need positive changes in the way our people live.”
Speaking about the engagement of PNGDHL in the project, Mr. Tararau said: “it is often difficult to negotiate for the betterment of our people when permit holders are foreign owned. Logging agreements in Abau have been partly fulfilled to a certain degree. I am therefore happy that the government through PNGDHL is driving a new course of forestry in PNG. I know they will understand us better and ensure our people in the operation areas have basic services.

Australia helps boost PNG Customs Border Protection Capabilities,23/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5746,"PNG Customs will soon have a Detector Dog Facility following the ground breaking ceremony today in Port Moresby.
With support from Australia, this is a step forward in strengthening border security along PNG borders to help deter criminal syndicates.
Speaking at the ceremony in Port Moresby, Australian High Commission’s Andrew Bailey, said the initiative reflects the deep and longstanding partnership between Australia and Papua New Guinea, highlighting the work of detector dogs in in protecting borders.
“Detector dogs are a proven, highly effective tool in protecting borders, deterring criminal syndicates, and safeguarding communities.”
“As PNG approaches its 50th anniversary of independence, this program is another example of how our two nations stand together – yumi stap wantaim – to build a safer and more secure region,” Mr Bailey said.
The Australian Border Force Detector Dog Program, recognised internationally as a World Customs Organisation Regional Dog Training Centre, has been working closely with PNG Customs to establish professional capability.
This includes the recruitment of PNG Customs detector dog handlers, training and supervision opportunities, including participation in the Pacific Detector Dog Program Forum in Fiji, supporting the development of operational procedures, training, and animal welfare standards and assisting in the design of the new facility.
Australia will also support PNG Customs by gifting ABF-bred detector dogs.
Mr Bailey said detector dogs play a critical role in combating transnational crime.
“From narcotics and firearms to illicit tobacco and explosives, detector dogs are a powerful non-intrusive screening tool that can complement and, in some cases, replace technological solutions,” he said.
The initiative is expected to strengthen PNG’s border enforcement, disrupt criminal syndicates, and contribute to economic stability through enhanced revenue collection."
Marape acknowledges PNG judiciary,22/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5743,"Prime Minister James Marape has reaffirmed the independence of Papua New Guinea's judiciary as the foundation of national unity, democracy, and sovereignty, declaring it the better arm of government that has safeguarded the nation for the past 50 years.
Speaking at the opening of the International Conference on Judicial Integrity and Well-being in Port Moresby, Prime Minister Marape welcomed judges, legal scholars, and practitioners from PNG and abroad, emphasising that the rule of law remains the anchor of the country's stability since Independence in 1975.
""We are an ancient civilisation, but as we fused into one nation in 1975, it has been the judiciary that underpinned the stability and oneness of our country,"" he said.
Prime Minister Marape traced PNG's journey from its ancient cultural heritage to modern statehood, noting that the judiciary has been central to maintaining order in one of the most linguistically and culturally diverse countries on earth.
""Our diversity of over one thousand tribes, more than 800 languages, and hundreds of islands has been bound together by one Constitution and one judiciary,"" Prime Minister Marape said.
""For 50 years, the courts have been the safeguard of our freedoms, our unity, and our democracy. They remain the final arbiter when politics is divided.""
The Prime Minister highlighted that PNG's Constitution remains ""the most reverent piece of law in our land"" and has endured with fewer than 50 amendments in half a century.
Recalling his own political career, Prime Minister Marape credited the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare for instilling respect for judicial authority in times of political tension.
""In 2011, when stress emerged between Parliament, the Executive, and the judiciary, Sir Michael told us: 'The court is always right.
Let's go to court and respect the court.' That lesson has been deeply ingrained in me,"" Prime Minister Marape reflected.
The Prime Minister outlined several reforms aimed at strengthening the judiciary, including: raising the retirement age of judges to 72, with plans to extend to 75; establishing a new Court of Appeal between the National and Supreme Courts; increasing judicial appointments to more than 200 nationwide; ensuring judicial administration is financially and operationally independent of the Executive; and investing over K700 million in the new national courthouse in Waigani, which will incorporate technology and accommodate the new appellate structure.
The new national courthouse in Waigani, to be officially opened on September 12, will not simply be a physical structure. It is designed as a technology-driven hub that will link all court centres across the country through ICT, with integrated connections to magisterial services and police reporting systems. More than a building, it symbolises Papua New Guinea's commitment to an independent, modern, and functional judiciary. The September opening will mark a new direction for the nation's justice system, setting a framework that will serve the country for the next 50 years.
Prime Minister Marape assured the judiciary of full government support, saying: ""We cannot afford to weaken the independence of our judiciary. In a nation as diverse as ours, there must be one rule book, one reader of law, and one authority - the judiciary.""
The Prime Minister also urged regional cooperation, inviting Pacific Island nations to share resources, expertise, and judicial functions.
He said PNG, with its extensive court system ranging from village courts to the Supreme Court, is ready to support neighbours in strengthening the rule of law.
“Fifty years on, the role of the judiciary is greater than ever. Our democracy, sovereignty, and national unity depend on it. The judiciary will continue to be the safety net for our people and the anchor of our nation's future,” Marape added."

He made this announcement following his bilateral meeting with the Solomon Islands Prime Minister, Jeremiah Manele in Port Moresby yesterday.
PNG has been offering support to Solomon Islands when needed including the Pacific Games in 2023, the engagement of RPNGC officers during SI elections and the support in the education space where Solomon Islands students are given privileges to study in PNG institutions among others.

ENBPHA conclude Public Finance Management Training,21/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5734,"The East New Britain Provincial Health Authority (ENBPHA) has completed its Public Finance Management training for its health workers serving in the Pomio district. Held at Palmalmal station, the four-day training is part of the ENBPHA’s continued efforts to strengthen financial governance and accountability.  The training targeted health workers (Officer in Charge, Sister in Charge and Clerks) who are involved in managing or handling public funds at the district level.
The Public Finance Management guidelines include eleven recently endorsed Public Finance Management policies and procedures, including cash advance, procurement, fraud, and risk management, among others. These policies were designed to enhance compliance, efficiency, and transparency in financial practices across all levels of the health system. Health Services Improvement Program (HSIP) Officer Emmanuel Sialis, described the value of the training.
“With the support of the PNG Australia Transition to Health Program, we successfully rolled out this training in four districts. Our frontline health workers are trained clinicians, and they often lack the financial skills to manage their day-to-day operation needs, which is an important aspect of healthcare delivery. That’s why we are working closely with partners to help our staff understand key financial process and policies, including delegation of authority, procurement, fraud prevention, internal audit, and risk management, so that they would be in a better position to access funding for their respective health facilities,” Sialis said.
“This training is a critical step in ensuring that our health workers serving in rural areas are fully equipped with the knowledge and tools to manage public funds responsibly and transparently.”
The Public Finance Management rollout is part of the Corrective Action Plan (CAP) developed with support from the Australian Government through the PNG Australia Transition to Health (PATH), and Deloitte, following a review of ENBPHA’s financial systems.
Key outcomes included increased confidence in financial accountability, awareness of operational policies, and readiness to implement standardised procedures. The training also emphasised continuous monitoring, supportive supervision, and digital reporting pathways to strengthen transparency and resource management.
Health Extension Officer Victor Talmane of Sivauna Health Centre attended the training. Victor joined ENBPHA in 2019 but hadn't been aware of the PHA's financial processes until attending the workshop. Enthusiastic that he can now understand processes, mitigate risks, understand the role of documents when accessing funds, he feels more confident in his ability to run the health centre well.
“Health is everyone’s business, and with the support from Australia and other partners working hand in hand with the PHA, we can progress health, especially at the district level,” he says.
“When there’s a shortfall, our partners come to support. And I’m thankful that Australia, through its PATH program, is working with us at the provincial level to improve our systems and processes so we, as frontline health workers serving in remote areas, can be able provide better health care services in our rural communities.’’
Wayne Polout, HEO at Palmalmal Health Rural hospital reflected on the added value of the training for staff in rural areas.
“This is training is important to us especially for Health Extension Officers and OICs who are in charge of the health facilities in rural areas. This is adding value to our skills so we can improve managing our facilities and understand the processes of governance and accountability properly.
It’s good to have partners working with our PHA to fill in those gaps. At the end of the day, it’s the health of our people that matters.’’
Meanwhile, Mr Sialis says these policies will foster improved governance, reduce financial risks, promote transparency, and build capacity at the facility level, leading to more efficient and accountable financial management in health services.
“After this training, we at the PHA will see improvements in our Officers’ accessing of funds. This system-strengthening initiative will transform our approach to what we are doing at the provincial level, with long-term impact on the services we can provide and the health of our communities.”"

Plea for road access,21/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5730,"When the word ‘highway’ is used, an image of a long stretch of road immediately comes to mind. But not for the people of rural Huon Gulf district in Morobe Province.
For them, the Markham River is their highway as they travel down in motorised dugout canoes, called ‘mon’, to get food supplies, building materials, to access education and health services or to transport their cash crops like cocoa and coffee.
With the country preparing to celebrate 50 years of independence, all the people of Ngaraguma, Chiats and Mafanazo want, is road accessibility for the Watut River communities.
Kisa Giwisa, from Chiats village, in Wampar LLG, was helping to load cargoes onto the ‘mon’ at around 6.30pm after a three-hour trip from Lae, in preparation for the over 1-hour of cold and rough journey home against the current.
“We move around using three types of transportation; we come on the canoe, we leave it then get on a vehicle to go to the main highway at 40-Mile. At 40-Mile, we get on PMVs to go to town with our cocoas, garden food, vanilla, gold and other things to go to the market to help ourselves,” he shared.
“In good or bad weather, we move around like this.
“The main challenges we face include wet weather; we get drenched while out on the river, including our store goods. They get wet and damaged.
“Sometimes when we travel down in the morning with our market produce and cash crops like cocoa, the rain would fall.
“Sometimes, when we have engine problems, the canoe would capsize with our cargoes. I’m glad you are here to capture our pain.
“It’s expensive, using three different types of transportation. For example, a piece of roofing sheet bought from CASA Hardware or Mainland Plumbing in Lae, they will charge us K5 per roofing sheet from the highway down, then it’s another K5 per sheet from 40-Mile to the river, then another K5 per sheet when loading it onto the canoe to take to the village.
“This means it will cost K15 to move just one roofing sheet. So, imagine if I were to move 20 roofing sheets. It would cost a lot, that’s why I have to really save up if I want to do that.
“Even these steel posts here,” he gestured to a pile on the ground. “We have to really budget for these building materials.”
Giwisa said it would be a dream-come-true for his people if they could use only one type of transport to move to and from town, not to mention the money they can save from this.
“It is the cry of the Watut River communities to have a good road and bridge,” continued Giwisa. “We hope our MP can help us and bring these services to us so we can move without difficulty to access goods and services.
“We hope that this pain, felt by our forefathers and now us, will soon be a thing of the past.”"
K4M Land acquisition for Manam resettlement,21/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5726,"The Project Steering Committee of the Manam Resettlement Authority (MaRA)met with stakeholders from Bogia district, Madang Provincial Administrator Daniel Aloi and officials from the Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs (DPLLGA), and the Department of Lands to discuss ways forward for the people of Manam Island.
The meeting was underway yesterday at the Madang Resort Hotel. The party sealed the deal for a K4 million initial drawdown from a given K10 million to be utilized for land acquisition as soon as next week.
According to Mr. Aloi, the MaRA board has already passed these decisions and as members of the committee, they are ensuring that these decisions made are executed.
He acknowledged that it has taken a long time to get the ball rolling on resettling the Manam Islanders. Funding and legacy issues were some of the many challenges along the way. Finally, the displaced islanders will be resettled in Andarum.
DPLLGA as overseer of all Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), unequivocally stressed on the impact of inconsistent funding as a constraint towards the resettlement project. Director for City & Resettlement Authorities Patterson Kassam stated that a team will be sent in to Madang and onto Andarum for mobility and scoping work.
After land is acquired and people are resettled, DPLLGA will officially hand over the task to the provincial administration. The same approach will apply to other IDPs incluing the people of Kadovar in East Sepik and the displaced people of Mulitaka in Enga."

He added that cost wise, it’s cheaper with the facility in one location that entails two to three months intense training program.
“It would make sense for Papua New Guinea to look that direction and that’s a lot of value for money,” Kassman said.
Kassman said that he has reached out to the executive multiple times but has not received a response. He clarified that he has not been suspended, and his legal representative is looking into the matter.

PNGUoT student in viral video granted bail,20/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5719,"The PNG University of Technology student involved in the alleged sexual assault of a young woman is out on K3,000 court bail.
Twenty-one-year-old Sean Rolpagarea was identified by police in a viral video of PNGUoT male students harassing a mentally challenged young woman on campus between 7.30pm and 8.30pm on August 9.
He was charged with one count of sexual touching.
Rolpagarea, dressed in a blue button-down shirt, appeared before Magistrate Grace Peu at 10.33am today, in the Lae committal court, for his second mention.
Police prosecution, first constable Maureen Pohei, submitted that since Rolpagarea does not have a permanent residence in Lae, he is a “flight risk”.
In their bail reply, police prosecution said the defendant is unlikely to appear in his trial if granted bail.
“Given the circumstance of the defendant, he is a student at the PNG University of Technology,” said Pohei.
“He resides at the university campus. He is a flight risk and the court should consider before extending his bail or converting his police bail to court bail.”
However, prosecution submitted that the following bail conditions should be considered by the court if the court wishes to grant bail:
•	K5,000 bail to be imposed due to the seriousness of the offence
•	The defendant to only reside at the PNG University of Technology campus
•	The defendant to report to the officer-in-charge of prosecution every fortnight Tuesday between 8am-4pm.
Furthermore, prosecution said while the guarantor, Reuben Kalate, is a reputable man as per his profession at the PNG University of Technology, he is related to the defendant’s father. Therefore, prosecution submitted to the court to have two guarantors who are neutral persons and not related by blood or marriage to the defendant.
Defense counsel, Kibas Keindip of Gamoga Lawyers, responded that the defendant is a first-time offender. And in terms of guarantors, the two persons of ‘high standing in the community’ are Lae’s deputy lord mayor, Jacob Maragau, and one Damien Sagapuna.
After listening to both submissions, Magistrate Peu outlined that she is using her discretion, as permitted by the Bail Act, to have the defendant’s bail further allowed.
“Police bail is now converted to court bail,” she stated. “I will increase the amount from K2,000 to K3,000 cash bail and I will attach conditions to the bail.”
“The defendant is not to leave Lae, Morobe Province, without leave of court, the defendant is not to re-offend whilst he is out on bail, the defendant is to appear on all mentioned days as and when is required of him, the defendant is to report to OIC Prosecution every Tuesday government fortnight week, between the hours of 8am-4pm.”
Magistrate Peu further approved Maragau and Sagapuna as guarantors who will give K1,000 cash surety each."

ENB police reservists undergo training,20/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5715,"Training for selected police reservists in East New Britain Province began on Monday, August 18, and will run for eight weeks at the Gunan na Niuvia (GNN) facility in Kokopo. Two-hundred-and-twenty-six applicants have been shortlisted and are currently undergoing induction.
Program coordinator and provincial law and order programs officer, Romalus Tavui, confirmed the details last week, saying the program’s objective is to strengthen the capacity and effectiveness of reserve police personnel, to maintain law and order, whilst promoting community safety and the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
“The 262 shortlisted candidates fall into three main categories — National Reservists, Corporate Reservists, and Community Auxiliary Police (CAP),” Tavui explained.
Roles of the reservist categories:
•	National reservists will serve full-time alongside regular police officers, assisting in daily law enforcement duties.
•	Corporate reservists are professionals already in the workforce, whose expertise can support the RPNGC and its administration. This group includes doctors, former police officers, retired government officers, and other specialists.
•	Community Auxiliary Police (CAP) will be based at Local Level Governments (LLGs) and ward areas. They are respected community members selected for their leadership and contributions to local safety and order.
The eight-week program will combine theory and practical training.
Tavui noted that the reservists’ roles are guided by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed earlier this year between the East New Britain Provincial Government (ENBPG) and the RPNGC.
“As part of the MoU, the ENBPG is responsible for funding the program, including paying the allowances of all 262 reservists in the province,” he outlined.
Reservists will carry out their duties under the supervision of regular police officers, with one regular officer assigned to oversee groups of up to four (4) reservists.
Upon completing the training, they will be deployed to LLGs and districts with existing police posts.
Tavui confirmed that several hotspot areas have been identified for deployment, including Gelagela, where a police post is already in place.
The program will also serve as a recruitment pool for future police intakes, with the possibility of outstanding reservists being called up for full police training."
"Remove tinted windows, directs ENB authorities",20/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5713,"The escalating lawlessness in East New Britain Province has prompted authorities to direct that all tinted windows in public motor vehicles (PMVs) and taxis be removed.
ENB Provincial Administrator, Levi Mano, who is also the chairman of the provincial licensing committee of the National Road Traffic Authority board, is encouraging all licenced PMV and taxi operators to heed the call.
“This will allow for clear visibility for all road users of this public sector service, while it acts as a deterrent to future illegal activities,” outlined Mano.
“Whilst law enforcement agencies of government continue to conduct their work in addressing the situation in law and order in the province, the ENBPLC and the government expects compliance in this nature, as one approach towards dealing with this matter.”
Mano iterated that all stakeholders should collectively work towards restoring public safety, trust and confidence in this public sector transport service.
“Compliance to this instruction/directive is effective immediately, as of Wednesday, August the 13th, and shall be performed by the police department, both the national and provincial road traffic/ transport authorities and line agencies.”
Mano also advised that awareness is being implemented and that as of Monday August 18, non-compliance will result in penalties as stipulated for, under the Road Traffic Act of 2014.
Meanwhile, Kokopo Police Station Commander, Senior Inspector Neil Weiba, has called on citizens of East New Britain to work with the Royal PNG Police Constabulary (RPNGC) to provide information on criminals or suspects that are hiding in their villages.
He made these comments following the Kokopo robbery on Monday August 11, that led to the severe wounding and killing of a security guard. Police believe that the ring leader is a 2022 escapee from the Kerevat Correctional Services facility.
“A guard was killed in the process of the armed robbery on Monday. That guard who died, is from the same village as the suspects involved in that incident. So, if people do not come out to give information to police, the very people that they are hiding, will eventually turn around and do something bad to them again,” he said.
Snr Insp. Weiba iterated that even stolen vehicles are reportedly kept in the villages but no one is coming forward with information that will lead to the apprehension of the suspects.
“Police are always looking for information but we cannot forcefully get information from the villagers, because we respect their rights as well. But we do need their assistance to clean up their village (from criminal elements),” he said."

Marape welcomes Court Decision,19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5708,"Prime Minister James Marape who has been a state witness in The State Vs Yafai case since 2013 has welcomed today’s conclusion of the case that found former Deputy Finance Secretary, Jacob Yafai guilty of all five charges.
Describing this decision as a significant milestone in the fight against corruption, he also stated that this case should remind everyone that no one is above the law.
Marape reflected on the day he took up the role of Finance Minister back in 2012, and how he did his bit to reform the system.
“When I first arrived at the Department of Finance as Minister in August 2012, I found a system that had been seriously eroded,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“The department had become a target for paper-pushers and white-collar opportunists who treated it like a money-making machine for the ruling class. From day one, I made it my mission to restore order, streamline processes, and cut off avenues for abuse.”
Among the reforms introduced during his time as Finance Minister were the transition from paper-based to electronic transactions, and new measures to reduce discretionary influence in claim settlements. These reforms, formally launched in 2018, laid the foundation for stronger financial governance.
Now, as Prime Minister, he also highlighted the reforms his government will undertake to tighten the gaps.
“As Prime Minister, I am now directing my government to go even further,” he said. “We will embrace artificial intelligence and ICT platforms in procurement, ensuring that contracts are awarded strictly on merit, not influence. By computerising systems and using AI, we can improve efficiency, close the gate on corruption, and eliminate decades of abuse.”
Commenting on the Paraka case itself, Prime Minister Marape was consistent with the court’s findings, stating that his instructions at the time: “My directive to Finance officers was always clear — verify the claims, and only pay what is genuinely due. If a claim was not valid, then it had to be stopped immediately. The word ‘settle’ did not mean automatic payment; it meant resolving the matter according to the facts.”
The Prime Minister emphasised that while ministers may come and go, the public service remains. Entrenched corruption within parts of the bureaucracy must be rooted out once and for all.
“This judgement comes as Papua New Guinea approaches 50 years of independence,” he said. “It is a timely reminder that no matter how long it takes, justice will prevail. No one can escape accountability if matters are properly investigated and prosecuted.”
Prime Minister Marape also spoke candidly about the risks he faced during his time as Finance Minister, particularly between 2013 and 2015, when he took decisive action to stop questionable and fraudulent payments.
“In standing firm against these illegal claims, I faced serious threats,” he said."
Yafai guilty for not verifying claims before paying Paraka,19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5707,"Former Deputy Secretary of Finance, Jacob Yafai who was charged with four counts of misappropriation and one count of abuse of office has now been found guilty as charged.
Yafai was found guilty for failing to do one simple thing – and that is to verify the payments with the Solicitor General’s office before making the payment.
Chief Justice Sir Salamo injia before handing down his decision read the charges to the former Deputy Secretary was charged for.
Counts 1 to 4 included the dishonest application of different amounts of money over different years to Paul Paraka, who is also serving time on a different charge. Total amount of money paid was K41.8 million kina.
Count 5 was for the abuse of officer.
When assessing the evidence and the arguments presented before the court during the trial, the Chief Justice said the directions from the then Finance Minister and now Prime Minister, James Marape were clear back then through a hand written notation that stated: “Secretary, please peruse, verify and settle”, signed on the 05th of October 2012. The then Secretary, Steven Gibson after citing it on the same day, wrote a notation on the bottom right side of the letter stating: “Deputy Secretary, Verify, confirm, settle”.
The Chief Justice in handing down the verdict told Yafai that the instructions from the then Finance Minister and Secretary through the short notes were clear and that was for him to verify before payment.
Yafai however, failed to verify with the Solicitor General’s office before paying Paraka monies totalling K41.8 million kina.
The office of the Solicitor General is responsible for payments of any brief outs by the state to private law firms and any business should be done in consultation with this government office.
Former Solicitor general, Neville Devete filed a complaint and had Yafai arrested and charged for misappropriation and abuse of office.
Yafai is now out on bail and will return on September 09th for submissions on conviction.
The Probationary Services were also advised to prepare a pre-sentence report together with a means assessment report and be delivered on 09th September to assist the court."

Gandep project progressing well,19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5704,"Ramu District and Madang Province is about to see the birth of a new mission township in the remote Middle Ramu District plains of Gandep.
To enable implementation of the “Gandep Project’ paperwork framework, Provincial Member Ramsey Pariwa and Middle Ramu MP Kansol Kamdaru, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with an incorporated mission-based entity ‘Transform the Nation Ltd Australia’ to implement this project, which will be facilitated by Melanesian Evangelical Church of Christ based in Gandep.
The “Gandep Project’ came about when Jim West Project Director with Transform the National Ltd Australia visited Gandep in 2009. He was appalled at the state of the community, its welfare and that people were dying prematurely from diseases, predominantly malaria, women were dying during childbirth and a sense of isolation pervaded villages.
“After extensive consultation with the local people, Jim and his friends committed to help the Gandep people by working with them to improve the track and so open the possibility of self-sustainable health, education and trade activity in this remote region,” said the Middle Ramu MP.
The ‘Gandep Project’ will see to the reconstruction of a track to an improved all-weather standard one, and to extend and rebuild the grass airstrip at Tsumba village at the Ramu River.
To be developed in nine stages, around 140 volunteers from Toowoomba have worked over the past 10 years to complete stages one and two of the projects and have raised $2.5 million to complete these stages. A further $4 million is required over the three years to complete stages three to six.
Recently machinery arrived in Madang for deployment to the project site. Ongoing consultations have occurred between the Middle Ramu DDA and project partners. Provincial Administrator Daniel Aloi emphasized on the positive impact this project.
To reduce bureaucratic bottle-neck and address compliance issues, Governor Pariwa and MP Kamdaru said they will assist with getting the appropriate support to meet Internal Revenue Commission tax obligation or exemption including addressing Customs and clearance issues to allow shipment of over K5 million worth of heavy equipment and machinery.
This will include motorized barge specifically built to transport fuel, goods and supplies up the Ramu River. The barge alone is valued at $1.6 million and will in future service the Ramu plains to move cargo and cash crops for the Middle Ramu people.
The MOU signing now paves the way for the commencement of the development of a township will service a population of over 20,000 people in 170 villages."
Gifting of the King’s colours,19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5702,"The gifting of the King’s colours from the British High Commission to Papua New Guinea is a significant diplomatic gesture, symbolizing the strong ties between the United Kingdom and PNG.

"Court to rule on Opposition leadership case, Wednesday",19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5701,"The National Court will hand down its ruling over the leadership battle between Chuave MP James Nomane and Kiriwina-Goodenough MP Douglas Tomuriesa tomorrow morning.
The matter over who should be the Opposition Leader, was heard in court today. Lawyers from both parties presented submissions on whether the national court has jurisdiction to hear the matter or should it be referred to the Supreme Court under section 18 (2) of the Constitution.
Section 18 (2) of the Constitution refers to any question relating to the interpretation or application of any provision of a Constitution law arises in any courts or tribunal, shall, unless the question is trivial, vexatious or irrelevant, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, and take whatever other action including the adjournment of proceedings is appropriate.
Nomane’s lawyer argued that majority of members of parliament had voted for and supported Nomane to be the opposition leader. Their submission stated that it’s the numbers that dictate parliamentary democracy and that it is a simple factual matter that does not cause or raise any questions or issues on the interpretation of section 64 (2) of the Organic Law on Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates (OLIPAC).
They submitted that the facts of the case are not in dispute or complicated and the law on section 64 (2) of the OLIPAC has already been interpreted and applied by the Supreme Court so any potential or perceived issue or question concerning section 64 (2) of the OLIPAC law is trivial, vexatious, and irrelevant to make referral to the Supreme Court for determination within the ambit and meaning of section 18 of the constitution.
Tomurisea's lawyer argues that the case involves the interpretation of section 64 (2) of the OLIPAC, and that the relevant law is section 18 of the Constitution, which states that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to the exclusion of other courts. Therefore, the proceedings must be dismissed as the national court has no jurisdiction to hear the matter, or refer it to the Supreme Court to rule on the matter.
Presiding judge Justice John Carey deferred the matter to tomorrow after hearing submissions from the parties."
PNG Constitution 50 years old,19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5698,"The PNG Constitution or “Mama Law” is as old as the country, but by a month, celebrating its birth on the 15 August 2025.
The PNG Constitution was adopted on 15 August 1975 following hundreds of consultations around the country.
Prime Minister James Marape in commemorating this important day expressed how men with great minds stood together to put together a document that holds a country with diverse cultures and languages together, even after 50 years.
In preparation for independence in 1975, members of the House of Assembly formed the Constitutional Planning Committee in 1972, headed by the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare as the Chair and Fr John Momis as the Deputy Chair of the Committee. Sir Michael was also the Chief Minister in the House of Assembly.
Following more than 2000 submissions and hundreds of consultations around the country – the first and the last time public consultations of this magnitude were conducted in the country – the document was ready for submission in 1974.
On August 13, 1974, Deputy Chair of the Committee Fr John Momis submitted the final report to the Chief Minister Sir Michael Somare recommending the adoption of the constitution for the soon-to-be-independent state of Papua New Guinea.
Prime Minister James Marape in commemoration of the day, took time to read this report that led to the adoption of the Constitution on August 15, 1975 – four weeks before the birth of PNG as a nation.
“Constitution precedes our national birth – and so today (15 August 2025) is very important. It must be engrained in our national conversations and our national calendar every year to honor the living document that has framed, shaped and molded our country to what we are today,” the Prime Minister said during his address to the nation on August 15, 2025.
All members of the planning committee have passed on except for three included Fr John Momis, now Dr, Sir John Kaputin and Toni Ila who are still alive. Prime Minister Marape acknowledged these men for their work.
“And I want to say today, looking back 50 years on, there aren’t too many complains on our constitution’s ability to maintain individual citizens’ rights to exist in our country in total freedom.”
He emphasized the importance of this constitution that now sees PNG enjoying a vibrant democracy, with a clear separation of powers between the three arms of government.
“The constitution demarcates our borders, the constitution reflects our national symbols, the constitution gives spirit to our national vision and what we as a country aspires for – for instance the five-point plan, the national goals that we have inside – the constitution secures every citizen’s right.”
He described these generation of leaders the greatest who have lived and challenged citizens to be proud Papua New Guineans.
“Just because the flag was lowered and not torn, just because there was no gun fight or no blood loss, no exchange of stressful contest between administration in Canberra and our intention for self-rule here in Waigaini, NCD and PNG mustn’t give us lackluster, low patriotic view of our country”.
Looking to the next 50 years, the Prime Minister reminded Papua New Guineans to ask themselves what they can do for the country to make it a better place for their children.
“The best contribution the government, civil servants, clergy men and all of us in the country – the best contribution young generations can give to your country and all of us present – is to forever live under the shade of this constitution which fathers, mothers and founders of our country birthed on this day 50 years ago. This is the punch line! This is the conversation!” Marape said.
The Prime Minister also called on current and future leaders not to manipulate the constitution to suit their convenience, instead should uphold its values."

""How can they expect to have a better life for their children if they continue to have these disgraceful fights. Tribal violence has no place in a modern Papua New Guinea.
""The actions of these tribesmen are disgusting, and this behaviour is keeping their people disadvantaged.

Usino-Bundi writ returned,18/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5691,"The Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission today returned the writ for the Usino-Bundi Open By-Election, confirming the election of Vincent Ambane Kumura as the duly elected Member of Parliament.
The return of the Writ ceremony was held at the Electoral Commission headquarters in Port Moresby, where the Chief Electoral Commissioner formally received the completed writ and the member-elect signed off on the official documents. The Writ will be delivered tomorrow at 10 am at the Government House for presentation to the Governor General, in line with the requirements of the Constitution and the Organic Law on National and Local Government Elections.
Electoral Commissioner Simon Sinai, in his remarks, said the by-election was conducted peacefully except for one incident where a polling team was hijacked by a candidate and his supporters.
He said the candidate responsible was later arrested and charged for hijacking and tampering with the election process, adding that such candidates would be penalized from contesting in future elections once the reports reach the electoral commission.
Mr Sinai thanked election officials for Usino-Bundi for working hard under difficult circumstances at times to successfully deliver the election.
""Kumura's election reflects the mandate of the people of Usino-Bundi who turned out in strong numbers to exercise their democratic right. His victory restores the full representation for the electorate in the national parliament,"" he said.
Mr Sinai said with the successful return of the writ, Kumura can now take his seat in parliament and continue to contribute meaningfully to national development."
Community safety initiatives,18/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5690,"NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab, is strongly encouraging city residents in suburbs, settlements, and communities to initiate community-based safety initiatives such as the Gerehu-for-Gerehu (G4G) and the City Wardens, to safeguard their neighborhood to help reduce crime.
Simatab said that whether it's forming a neighbourhood watch, establishing community patrols, or simply setting up clear lines of communication with their local police station, contributes to a safer city.
""Effective policing is not just about responding to crime; it's about building strong, resilient communities where citizens and police work hand-in-hand,"" stated Superintendent Simatab. ""I have been incredibly impressed by the dedication and commitment shown by these City Wardens and the members of Gerehu 4 Gerehu.”
“These initiatives are powerful examples of what can be achieved when communities take ownership of their safety and work collaboratively with the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
""The NCDC Warden Program, under the leadership of Governor Honourable Powes Parkop, the National Capital District Commission (NCDC) and the District Development Authorities has made a tangible difference in enhancing public safety at critical transit points and public spaces. Their visible presence, efforts to discourage illegal activities, and support for vulnerable individuals are invaluable. These wardens serve as the 'eyes and ears' of our frontline police officers, significantly extending our reach and ability to maintain order.
""The G4G initiative is a testament to the power of grassroots community action. This neighbourhoods watch program, driven by concerned residents, has shown remarkable results in a suburb that once faced significant law and order challenges. Their robust network, real-time reporting to police, and dedication to creating a safer environment for their families are truly inspiring. G4G's ability to operate largely on volunteer effort and their focus on youth engagement and crime prevention are models we wish to see replicated.
""The success stories of the City Wardens and G4G underscore a fundamental truth, we cannot fight crime alone,"" Superintendent Simatab emphasized. ""The police require the active support and participation of every citizen. I strongly encourage all suburbs, settlements, and communities across Port Moresby to organize similar community-based safety initiatives.”
Further information on how communities can initiate or strengthen their own safety programs, including access to police liaison officers and resources, will be made available through local police stations."
50 Years of Silence Broken; “We Are No Longer Forgotten”,18/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5689,"Hidden deep in the Adelbert Range and accessible only by a two-day trek through thick jungle from Sewan, Wanambre is a place where life demands physical strength, and survival is a shared legacy. With no road, no proper schools, no health posts, and no government infrastructure, the people of Winembre have endured this in silence. Until now.
Member for Sumkar Alexander Suguman Orme was able to visit the community last Thursday 14 August. It was the first time a member of parliament has ever visited Wanambre and clearly this will be etched into the local history.
“We see leaders drive past, fly over, talk in town — but none came here,” said one local elder. “Today, that changed. Today, we are no longer forgotten.”
Orme visited Wanambre to officially close the Lutheran Wanuma Circuit Conference. Through powerful storytelling, dance, and drama, the people of Wanambre illustrated their greatest need; a road – a road to access better education, better health care, markets, and a bright future.
During these plays they showed how mothers would walk for days to get medicine, and how children would miss out on school because of the long distances. These struggles eventually leave young people with no ambition or dreams to pursue.
In his address, Mr. Orme pledged support through the Sumkar District Development Authority, assuring the people their pleas have not got unheard.
“I have seen with my own eyes what you go through,” he said. “And I will not leave your voice behind.”
“Development must come here. Your road is not a dream — it is a right,” Orme declared.
He urged the community to remain united and resilient, promising that change will come, but only if they walk together.
As the sun set over the rugged mountains and fires lit up the village below, the people of Wanambre said they felt something they hadn’t in decades — hope.
“This is our 50-year Independence gift,” said one youth leader. “We’ve waited all our lives for this. Now, we believe the road will come — and with it, our future.”"
Government house land protest,18/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5688,"The clan of Kwaradubuna and Gunina at Hanuabada village staged a peaceful protest at the Government house today to hand over a petition regarding land on which the Government House sits on at Konedobu in the nation’s capital.
Landowners and clan members handed over a petition to Acting Official Secretary to the Government House, Bill Toraso.
Spokesman and principal claimant Arua Loa Boko, emphasized justice for landowners of both clans who were neglected and are seeking justice.
“The main reason we've staged this protest is because of the government's negligence in not attending to our land issues, as you've seen, we staged at the entrance of the Governor General's Office of Residence.
“It's been more than 72 years that our land has been occupied by the government, past governor generals, the current governor general and maybe future governor generals who will be residing on this land,” he said.
According to Boko, the Department of Lands had paid only one family in 2023, when the joint decision in 1953 covers eleven families.
“In 2008 we submitted a submission through the Department of Lands with relevant documents, unfortunately the 10 families were denied by the department and only paid one family.”
They are now seeking fair justice to the traditional landowners. The petition is addressed to the National Executive Council, the Governor General, Sir Bob Dadae, NCD Governor Powes Parkop, North West MP Lohia Boe Samuel and Deputy Governor and Motu Koita Assembly Chairman Russel Wavik.
The Acting Official Secretary to the Government House said he would make sure the petition is given to the prime minister.
“Under the direction of the current governor general, we managed to get one group here, and we progressed their claims here,” he said. “And now that we've got another 10 landowner groups with the petition, I will forward this to the prime minister's office, and they'll take it up from there.”
“As I said, agencies of government are not empowered to purchase land. Where they sit on those matters are dealt by the Department of Lands. And we've written to the Lands department a few times, and I'm sure that the Deputy Prime Minister who is the Minister for Lands is aware of this issue.
“So, this petition will be forwarded to the Prime Minister's office within this week. I sympathize with you people from Hanuabada and the land owners,” Toraso said."
Property of by-election candidate burnt,18/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5687,"Pastor Joseph Itaki, a candidate who contested the Usino-Bundi Open seat by-election has lost thousands of kina worth of properties to arson, allegedly by supporters of a rival candidate who also lost the race.
According to Ps. Itaki, a group of individuals launched an attack on his supporters at around 4pm on Tuesday August 12 in Ramu. He said the group went ahead and set fire to his permanent house, four vehicles, his outdoor kitchen and building materials for a new building for the Reformation Ministries and Churches Network (RMCN) church. The total cost of the loss is estimated to be K170,000.
The next day, police were deployed to Ramu and apprehended 63 suspects who are now locked up at the Ramu police station. Ps. Itaki says he does not want bail to issued, and that these suspects be transfeered to Madang to be processed.
Ps. Itaki, who had bowed out of the race in the 20th exclusion count, said he accepted that election outcome.
“I do not want trouble; I want perpetrators to be apprehended and the costs of my properties paid by instigators,” he said. “I have told my relatives and supporters to keep calm and maintain peace and let the law and justice take its course.”
“I know the word of God and will not instigate more problems, but I want those responsible to face the consequences,” stated Ps. Itaki."
NCD Police set to lead independence security operation,18/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5685,"The National Capital District Metropolitan Police Command will take charge of security operations leading up to the nation’s 50th Independence Jubilee Celebrations in September to ensure a safe and secure environment for everyone.
National Capital District Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab said that while this is a time for national pride and unity, our city is facing significant challenges.
He said the NCD Metropolitan Police Command acknowledges that police resources are stretched due to a growing population, an increase in squatter settlements, and high unemployment. These factors have put immense pressure on our policing efforts.
“Currently, we are seeing a concerning rise in crime, including armed robberies, violence linked to ethnic tensions, violence against women and children, and a widespread disregard for road safety. We have identified that many of these crimes are committed by individuals under the influence of alcohol.
“In response to this, and under the direction of the Commissioner of Police and the NCD/Central Divisional Commander, the NCD police have stepped up our operations since last month.  This is a high-impact, high-visibility blitz aimed at putting more officers on the streets to restore public confidence, reduce crime, and ensure law and order,” Metsupt Simatab said.
Key areas of  focus are:
•Ending ethnic violence and conflicts.
•Protecting women and children from harm.
•Enforcing traffic laws and improving road safety.
•Cracking down on anti-social behavior.
•Improving our investigations and prosecution of criminals.
He said law and order is everyone's business, and police are calling on all citizens, communities, women, girls, children, and men to work with the police. He said the police need the public's support to make this a safe and peaceful celebration.
“As part of this strategy, we are working closely with the NCDC through its liquor licensing committee to seek their endorsement to place restrictions on the sale of alcohol, especially in settlements and areas known for alcohol-fueled violence and disorder. This partnership is crucial to ensuring compliance and reducing the harm caused by unethical sales practices. The police are committed to delivering a safe and peaceful Jubilee celebration. We urge all residents of Port Moresby to support our efforts and report any criminal or suspicious activity to the police. Together, we can make our city safe,” Simatab added."
"Talai situation contained, peace talks negotiated",17/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5681,"The affected community at Talai settlement are calling for peace talks to settle an ethnic clash between Engans and the Goilala’s this morning.
According to community leader Joe Oboda Gaida, the fight started during a drunkard brawl between youths yesterday in the area. The confrontation continued into this morning, which resulted in a fight between the two groups.
The Engans slashed a Goilala man with a knife, while a Goilala man sustained severe injuries. He is in critical condition at the Port Moresby General Hospital. The Goilala’s retaliated and burnt down two houses belonging to the Engans.
“We are appealing to the Engans that we don’t want retaliation, all we want is peace talks to settle this issue, so no more lives will be lost.”
“We lost one and one is fighting for his life at the hospital; therefore, retaliating will make the situation worse, so please come forward to help us solve this issue.
“We also call on the police to continue maintain presence in the area until the situation is contained, Gaida said.
The community leader thanked Badili police for their swift response to calm the situation.
Meantime, District Administrator Moresby South, Aisop Mol said they have negotiated for peace talk, with strong warnings issued to the Goilala’s to stop retaliation and let police deal with the issues.
A full police unit from the Badlili police station is currently on the ground to provide security.
Police are investigating the situation."
PM Calls for Allegiance to Constitution,17/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5680,"Prime Minister James Marape has called on Papua New Guinean’s to recommit to the National Constitution, describing it as the “Mama Law” that binds the nation together and ensures freedom, peace, and equality.
Speaking during a press conference to mark 50 years since the adoption of the Constitution by the House of Assembly on 15 August 1975, PM Marape said the document was the foundation that gave life to Papua New Guinea’s independence a month later on 16 September 1975.
“Our Constitution’s birth ushered in our country’s birth,” PM Marape said. “It must forever be ingrained in our national calendar, in our national conversations, and in the hearts of every Papua New Guinean. It is the living spirit that embodies us all.”
Tribute to Founding Fathers and Mothers
The Prime Minister recalled a 1974 letter from Constitutional Planning Committee  Deputy Chairman Fr John Momis to Chief Minister Michael Somare, urging that the Committee’s report be presented to Papua New Guineans rather than Canberra. He said this showed the boldness of the CPC, paying tribute to its members as “giants who walked before us” and credited them with giving PNG one of the world’s best constitutions. Only three CPC members remain alive—Dr John Momis, Sir John Kaputin, and Tony Ila—who will be honoured during next month’s independence celebrations.
A Call for Respect and Responsibility
PM Marape urged leaders and citizens alike to live under the Constitution’s authority, stressing that no individual, whether Prime Minister, Parliamentarian, or Judge, was above it.
“The Constitution ranks supreme at all times,” he declared. “In our Constitution we find unity, in it we find peace, in it we find the formula for equitable benefit distribution, and in it we find direction for the future.”
He warned against repeating moments of constitutional crisis such as in 2011, when leaders attempted to place themselves above the law, and reminded politicians that the Constitution will always bring them “back in line.”
Constitution as the Nation’s Guide
Highlighting the five National Goals and Directive Principles—integral human development, equality and participation, national sovereignty and self-reliance, wise use of resources and environment, and Papua New Guinean ways—PM Marape said these timeless values continue to guide the nation.
“Our democracy still functions because of the vitality of this Constitution,” he said. “As we look to the next 50 years, we must never take our sovereignty for granted.”
Marape also shared a personal reflection, noting that as a boy living in the remotest areas of Western Province in 1975, he could never have imagined becoming Prime Minister without the equal opportunities enshrined in the Constitution. “Had it not been for this Constitution, children from remote villages like me would never have had such chances,” he said.
Looking Ahead
With four weeks to Independence Day, PM Marape urged citizens to reflect on their duty to the nation. He said the best contribution anyone could make was not only in building roads, bridges, or classrooms, but in respecting the rule of law and living under the Constitution.
“If you ask what you can do for your country, start by respecting the Mama Law,” he said. “Apart from the Bible, the Constitution is the most important document we have. It protects every citizen and ensures our unity as one people, one nation, under one good Constitution.”
He concluded by pledging loyalty to the Constitution and calling on all Papua New Guineans to do the same as the nation prepares to celebrate 50 years of independence next month."
City Warden Initiative Transforms Gordons,17/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5679,"Crime rate in Gordons area in the nation's capital has seen significant change since the inception of the city warden initiative, says NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab.
Simatab said that in the past, Gordon's was known as one of the notorious areas in the city. Crimes, ranging from minor to serious, were reported there; however, recently, there have been significant changes.
He said Gordon's Police Station Commander, Senior Inspector Gabriel Kini, and his office have been very supportive of the wardens since their engagement there. He mentioned that one of the biggest challenges they face every day at the location is crowd control due to the overwhelming number of vendors the bus stops, shop fronts, and other undesignated areas.
""I am in constant communication with NCDC and other stakeholders on how we can manage the issue of overcrowding at the bus stop, which poses a high risk to the people who are commuting there. I am pleased with how the police and the wardens are working together at the moment. We will try to improve on that by increasing police presence at the location. We are all humans, and we must all work together to find a win-win situation for everyone accessing Gordons, whether to do business or transit to their respective homes, schools, or workplaces,"" Simatab said.
Metsupt Simatab said that with days remaining before the country celebrates fifty years of independence, people's way of doing things must also change. He mentioned that if people are educated but engage in activities that are against the laws of this country, they must sit and reflect in the remaining days and try to change. He emphasized that as one educated person changes, he or she will influence others.
""Most people who are not educated and live in the city still have an educated person from their area whom they look up to as their hero. If you change, the rest of your tribesmen will change. You must stand out and talk to them when they try to do things that are against the law,"" Metsupt Simatab said.
He said the police are trying their best to help ensure everyone in the city receives policing services with whatever resources they have. He stated that the public must continue reporting crimes to the police so they have good statistics to work with to improve their policing services."
Simbu Expands Rural Development Projects,17/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5678,"The Simbu Provincial Administration has opened a new double classroom at Yandimae Primary School in the Siane LLG, Chuave District, under the World Bank’s Rural Service Delivery Project (RSDP).
The project, valued at K140,000, is part of K1.5 million in funding delivered to Siane LLG, covering 14 community initiatives. These include two aid posts, a maternity building, three water supply systems, solar power, a community hall, and women-led bulb onion farming projects.
Simbu Project Manager, Nickson Kawage, confirmed that the Yandimae classroom was the first to be completed.
“The total cost spent in Siane LLG includes classrooms, health facilities, and community infrastructure—all aimed at improving rural livelihoods,” he said.
Simbu is one of five provinces chosen by the World Bank to pilot World Bank’s RSDP initiative, with K6 million allocated across Chuave, Sinasine Yongumugl, Gumine, and Kerowagi districts.
Governor Noah Kool pledged an additional K500,000 from the provincial government to support and expand the program.
Education inspector, Elisabeth Akore highlighted the impact on learning.
“Before all elementary and primary schools in Chuave had very low academic performance. I encourage head teachers and teachers to teach best to their students, gradually the school changes, teachers change, and academic performance increases its speed.”
The project reflects a strong collaboration between the provincial government, World Bank, and local communities to uplift rural education and services."
Ten Thousand Visits Logged at Lombrum Medical Centre,16/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5676,"The redeveloped Lombrum Medical Centre, led by Papua New Guinea and the Australian Defence Organisations, has recently passed a milestone of having its 10,000-patient visit.
As part of the first phase of the Lombrum Joint Initiative, which began in Mid - 2020, the medical centre was constructed alongside refurbishments to the community chapel, upgrades to the communication centre, and construction of security fencing for the Lombrum Naval Base.
As part of PNG and Australia’s ongoing partnership, Australian Army tradespeople from the 6th Engineer Support Regiment and project engineers along with support staff from the 12th Chief Engineer Works were on-site to aid in the construction at Lombrum through the PNG-Australia Defence Cooperation Program.
This was an opportunity for Australian Army tradespeople to work side-by-side with PNG counterparts to improve key infrastructure at Lombrum, both for the PNGDF and local community.
Further works to refurbish and rebuild Lombrum Naval Base’s key infrastructure commenced in mid-2021, including new electrical generation services to power the island, new water and sewage services to supply the base and new maritime infrastructure, including barge landing ramps.
The joint development project also provided facilities for PNGDF for work, training and accommodation as well as operational facilities for the Guardian - class Patrol Boats and small boat operations."
Korean aid program helps Kemabolo community access clean water,16/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5674,"The rural community of Kemabolo in Rigo District has taken a major step towards a climate-resilient future this week with the launch of a KOICA-supported (Korea International CooperationAgenyc)  social services program that will deliver clean water, improve education and health, and strengthen protection services for children.
The program implemented by UNICEF in partnership with the Central Provincial Government, Rigo District Development Authority, Climate Change and Development Authority (CCDA), and the National Department of Planning and Monitoring — will directly reach 30,000 people, including 12,000 children and improve health and education outcomes for nearly 450,000 across the country.
At the heart of the launch, which took place on Wednesday, was the commissioning of a solar-powered water supply system, aiming to deliver safe, reliable water from boreholes to all 250 households in Kemabolo. The system will also supply schools and health facilities, reducing the community’s vulnerability to worsening droughts and floods.
“The Government of Korea has donated money through UNICEF to upgrade the living condition of this village, and I know this project will be a success,” said H.E. Jung Ho Choi, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Papua New Guinea, as he turned on the tap to let water flow from the newly completed boreholes.
The initiative follows a Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (CRVA), which revealed that Kemabolo faces intensive droughts, poor water quality, inadequate sanitation, and limited livelihood opportunities.
Women bear the greatest burden of managing scarce water during prolonged dry periods, while access to climate information and financial services remains minimal.
“For us, water is not simply a resource — it is a daily struggle,” said Joan Gwaibo, Head of the Women’s Committee.
“It was something the women of Kemabolo carried on their backs and in their arms, walking long distances under the scorching sun, often before dawn or after dusk.”
Mackllah Gulu, the school head girl, added: “Water is not just a basic need for life — it is a right. When proper water is supplied to the school, it helps students stay in school, stay healthy, and achieve their dreams, especially girls.”
Despite these challenges, community engagement has been exemplary. Residents already formed a Water User Committee representing youth, women, education, health, and faith leaders. This committee will manage operations, maintenance, and sustainability through a monthly household contribution system.
“Rigo District and Kemabolo can be champions in showing how climate-smart social services can be established and sustained,” said Veera Mendonca, UNICEF Representative.
“This is not just about infrastructure — it’s about local ownership, resilience, and protecting the most vulnerable.”
Deputy Secretary for the National Department of Planning and Monitoring, Michael Kumung, underscored the significance of the project: “Creating a good environment for our children and their communities to enjoy their life is fundamental to our progress going forward in the next 50 years. If we are to reset our country, this is the basic reset we must do at the community level. Providing clean and safe drinking water is where it starts.”
This local initiative is part of the broader UNICEF–KOICA regional climate partnership, launched in May 2024 with a landmark close to US$25 million grant to strengthen climate-smart social services in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and selected African countries.
For Kemabolo, the benefits will include:
• Solar-powered water supply for all households, schools, and health facilities.
• Solarization Solarisation of the school block as an information hub.
• Rehabilitation of the local aid post to restore essential health services.
With the combined efforts of government, partners, and the community, Kemabolo is all set to be an inspiring example of how rural communities can adapt to climate change while protecting children’s futures. “This is not just a campaign — let it be a turning point for the children of Papua New Guinea.”"
Liquor Restriction imposed in NCD in preparation for Independence,16/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5672,"The National Capital District (NCD) Liquor Licensing Committee has announced sweeping liquor restrictions across settlement areas and selected suburbs in Port Moresby in preparation for the nation’s 50th Independence anniversary celebrations.
The new measures, taking effect from August 16, 2025, are aimed at curbing alcohol-related crimes and ensuring a peaceful environment for both residents and international visitors during the milestone event.
This announcement was made during a press conference led by NCD City Manager Ravu Frank, Committee Chairman and Member for Moresby North East John Kaupa, NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab, and committee member Kwina Ongugo.
Kaupa emphasised that the restrictions were necessary to address persistent law and order issues, particularly in settlements where illegal alcohol sales and social unrest have been prevalent.
“The committee has decided to put restrictions to all the settlement areas and some of the suburbs that also sell alcohol,” he stated.
A list of affected areas will be published in local newspapers.
He added, “The standard fine on illegal selling of alcohol is K500 for every offence, and police will confiscate your stock as evidence.”
Metropolitan Superintendent Simatab noted that Port Moresby’s population has surged to over a million, intensifying policing challenges and leading to a spike in serious crimes, many of them alcohol-related. He outlined increased police operations, including early morning patrols and a focus on hotspots, road safety, and protecting women and children.
“We are partnering with the committee to endorse these restrictions to empower police to enforce liquor operations. This will help us in reducing alcohol related problems,” Simatab explained.
Violators of the new restrictions—including licensed and unlicensed sellers—face fines, license termination, and confiscation of stock. The measures will remain in force until the first week of January 2026, after which authorities will review their effectiveness in improving law and order.
The committee urged all communities to cooperate and celebrate the golden jubilee peacefully, highlighting the presence of international dignitaries and the importance of national pride during the celebrations."

Bird sets a course for his future in politics,15/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5661,"East Sepik Governor, Allan Bird has been a vocal and no-nonsense member of parliament over the past eight years but says he has accomplished what he set out to do as a member of parliament when he first entered politics in 2017.
It certainly brought mixed emotions when he announced on his Facebook page on Wednesday, 15 August 2025 that he will contest the national general elections one last time, in 2027.
While he initially said 10 years was enough time to serve the people of East Sepik, the governor in consultation with his more than 127,414 people has conceded to run his last election.
In an exclusive interview with TVWAN Online yesterday, he deliberated further on that decision and his future plans in politics.
“When you set up to achieve something, and when you achieve it, you move on. For me, around 1993 I went home to my village to bury my grandfather, and I saw how poor my people were, not so much in terms of food, but they were cash poor.
“So, I did something about that. I got involved in the vanilla industry, but I realized it wasn't enough. So, when I became governor in 2017, the first thing I wanted to do was how to empower these people and make their lives better.”
In the course of his political career as the governor, Bird helped strengthened the economy by improving agriculture in East Sepik, making it the largest cocoa producer in the country and setting the bench mark, attracting several other provinces in the country to follow suit.
In highlighting other areas of improvement he has witnessed under his administration, he said that the performance of schools in East Sepik have improved and are now ranked higher than before, the health sector has also improved from being the 21st province out of 22 to now being ranked 11th.
“The people of East Sepik have so much money now, village people have money in their pockets. For example, you go to a supermarket and see Ox and Palm are still on the shelves, but if you go to Maprik on a Thursday or Friday all the Ox n Palm are finished as well as other meat products.
“We're not doing brilliantly, but in terms of the current measurement system, we've improved a lot, and we still have a long way to go.”
After close consultation with key supporters in the Sepik and around the country, Governor Bird decided to concede and run his last election and retire in 2032.
“What else am I going to do? Am I going to waste my time in Parliament talking to people who don't understand what I'm trying to say? People who get upset with me for saying what I’m saying? I should be spending my time in more productive pursuits, that's the way I was thinking.
“But I get a lot of messages and when I meet Papua New Guineans, when I come back home in Sepik just going up to some of our villages, opening a little health center, or just meeting people, and they all saying, look you can't leave. You can't abandon us. And then they start crying.
And so I'm like, oh my God, you stop and you start to think again. So, you know, I guess if we're not making other people's lives better, than you know, what's the point of us being here? That's when I started talking to the people back home and said, all right, well, look, maybe one last one - I'll still have enough time to go into retirement.”
Party alignment going forward
And as he looks to continue his political career one more term, Bird also has plans about which party he aligns himself with, expressing his desire to join smaller parties with young like-minded MPs.
“I'm joining a small party, there's two members of parliament in there currently. I don't want to reinvent the wheel, you know. And they've got, you know, you look for like-minded people, and they've got a good organization. The two MPs are young, which is good because then I get to mentor them, because I intend to exit in 2032, I really don't want to stay in politics because it's really nasty business. Papua New Guinean politics is cutthroat. It's tribal, it's vicious.
“Because the members are young, even the executives are young, a lot of my suggestions, they've agreed to, which you won't get in a large party. They don't want to change. So for instance, one of the things we've done is we've paid for some very smart young people to develop an online application. So, you know, I always preach about transparency and good government. So if I'm going to be part of a political party, I want that organization to be transparent and accountable. It starts there.
“The app is already developed. So if someone wants to join our political party, they can go online, become a member, take their photo, load up their details, and it's going to be totally private. If they want to contribute money, they can become financial members. If they want to be just a member and not a financial member, we can also be able to manage that online.
“One of the problems with PNG politics is that after you vote for the Member of Parliament, you have no control over this member of parliament or what he does. We are trying to create something different. Being part of a new party, they're open to new ideas. An example is, if we're going to vote on a bill in Parliament and with a million members online, what we want to do is get that bill, put it onto the site and get the peoples’ ideas and thoughts. This way people can still reach out to Parliament.”
An announcement will be made once formalities are completed at the end of this month."
SEZA affirms Caution Bay SEZ on state land,15/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5657,"The Special Economic Zone Authority (SEZA) has refuted claims by the Governor for Central Province, Rufina Peter, regarding the Central Province Industrial Park (Caution Bay SEZ) project.
SEZA in denying these claims said the industrial park, being developed by Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) is situated entirely on State Land and has no legal or operational connection to the Konebada Petroleum Park.
KPHL and SEZA have engaged with relevant State agencies and Laba Holdings Limited, representing impacted local landowners, to ensure that community interests are embedded in the project design.
This includes agreed spin-off benefits such as,
• Construction of a community health clinic;
• Establishment of Police and Fire service stations;
• Direct engagement of local SMEs and skilled labour from surrounding areas.
SEZA also brushed aside claims by the governor that there has been no consultation.
“Engagement has been ongoing with authorised landowner representatives and State bodies responsible for land administration and project approval. “
“As a matter of record, KPHL has the full legal right to develop the site, including the right to determine its project branding. “
The first phase of the Caution Bay SEZ involves a US$145 million investment in a training academy and steel fabrication facility, due for completion in 2026 and the second phase investment will be at the value of US$336.7 million.
This project is expected to create approximately 3,000 to 7000 training and employment opportunities for Papua New Guineans, building the nation’s capacity for high-value industrial activity"

Addressing SARV through workshops,14/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5652,"The Melanesian Institute for Pastoral & Economic Services, based in Goroka has been a major driver of campaign against Sorcery Accusation Related Violence mostly in the Highlands region in Papua New Guinea for several years.
It is using community forums, educational campaigns, and workshops to equip youths and community members with the tools for evidence-based thinking, challenging unverified beliefs.
The institute in partnership with law enforcement agencies, educational institutions, religious organizations, and local leaders is now leading a new initiative in addressing deeply ingrained beliefs about sorcery that have led to violence, particularly against women, in Papua New Guinea.
The initiative seeks to create a more informed and resilient society. Accusations of sorcery, often based on superstition, have affected women, making them targets of violence and discrimination.
The Melanesian institute staff were in Yonki, Eastern Highlands province recently, following the conclusion of their initial series of workshops in the districts of Kainantu and Goroka from August 4 to 6, 2026.
The program aims to foster critical thinking and constructive dialogue throughout the Highlands region, to counter violence linked to these allegations and reinforcing human rights.
Religious leaders are also playing a vital role by promoting messages of compassion over fear to transform public perceptions.
The success of the program could serve as a model for other regions facing similar challenges."
NCD roads undergo maintenace in preparation for Independence,14/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5651,"There are road rehabilitation works currently going on in parts of Port Moresby, slowing down traffic in many parts of the city.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop confirmed that these road works are to fix roads that need maintenance in order for the city to be anniversary-ready come September.

Works are being undertaken both during the day and night, along with temporary traffic disruptions as expected. Drivers have been urged to follow road signage, traffic management setups, and respect construction zones.
However, residents have voiced concerns on social media about traffic delays, congestion, and lack of clear schedules for the works.
Commuters have specifically raised frustration over the Koura Way to Freeway tunnel closure, and some have suggested roadworks be undertaken during off-peak hours or weekends.
Others highlighted safety concerns regarding PMV buses on footpaths and questioned the coordination of multiple simultaneous road projects across the city.

The journey began with handpicked Daga coffee beans, which were carefully transported through a complex logistical network demonstrating the dedication and hard work of local farmers.
Despite several challenges, including limited road access and the need for chartered flights, this shipment represents both the personal sacrifices of the Daga coffee community and their collective effort to establish Daga coffee in the global marketplace. “It’s not just about money; it’s about discovering Daga coffee through our partnership with Estonia,” Puinam stated.
In Estonia, Hannes Saarppu, the proprietor of Renegade Coffee, eagerly anticipates the arrival of the Daga coffee shipment. He plans to market the coffee under his brand, showcasing the unique flavors of Papua New Guinea to European consumers.

This strategic plan was prepared by the Department of Transport with support from its transport sector agencies and key stakeholders, including the Development Partners.
Minister for Works and Highways, Solan Mirisim represented both the Minister for Transport Miki Kaeok & Prime Minister James Marape at the launching as both were away on other business.
Minister Mirisim commended the secretary for transport and his team for their hard work in developing the strategic plan. He also extended his appreciation to other development partners and stakeholders for their contribution.
“The MTTP3 is our government’s implementation roadmap to build a safe inclusive, climate resilient and integrated transport system. Whether by road, by sea or air MTDP 3 provides the direction for a transport system that reaches Papua New Guineans, no matter where we live.
Importantly, under this plan we will continue to prioritize gender equality, disability and social inclusivity in the development and delivery of transport programs so that all Papua New Guineans get ultimate benefit from our transport planning.” Solan Mirisim said.
Secretary for Transport Mathew Wowoni admitted the geographical challenges of PNG which include high mountainous regions, low mangrove and swampy plains and major river systems, posing significant land transport connectivity issues, however said there is hope in this MTTP3.
“What makes this launch more meaningful is that the new MTTP3 is not the beginning, it is a continuation of a real progress that is already underway through transport sub-sectors across the country.
“Transformative work is happening on roads under the connect PNG program, sea transport under the national shipping services program with the Department of Transport, and the rehabilitation of ports under the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility of Pacific or AIFFP through the PNG Ports Corporation Limited,” Secretary Wowoni said.
Australian Minister Counsellor, Economic, Health & Infrastructure, Dr. Cate Rogers, representing the Australian government, acknowledged that working together can accomplish vibrant and resilient transport infrastructures.

K214 billion expanded over 12 years without M&E,14/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5644,"A massive K214. 5 billion kina has passed through the government budgets over the last 12 years without any proper mechanism to monitor and evaluate the use of these funds.
Prime Minister James Marape pointed this out during the launch of the National Monitoring and Coordination Authority (NMCA) last night, reinforcing the importance of having this new agency in place to monitor and scrutinize the use of government funds.
With the nation at the threshold of its 50th Independence Anniversary, Prime Minister James Marape raised concerns of how huge budgets have been passed in the last 12 years, but no data in the government records to justify this spending.
“From 2013 to 2018, our total six-year budget under the past government was K83.5 billion. 2019 to 2024, the last six years under the PANGU administration, the collective six years, we have spent around almost K131 billion kina.
“All in all, the last 12 years, K214.5 billion has passed through previous treasurers and current treasurers and under our last two prime ministers.
“I speak from this background of executive government, not knowing exactly what has happened. Statistics are weak and the results that we have delivered is not clearly evident, number one. Number two, the requirement of our public finance reporting is really, really poor and not up to standard. And so every agency in the state that receives money must report back,” Marape said.
While comparing budget in the past, he said allocations in the last six years have been big but despite these allocations, countless strategies and plans, results are not visible.
“The question we ask ourselves is what have we done with these amount of resources? Over the past months, I have made it clear that the government can no longer afford the cost of weak coordination, delayed delivery, or worse, but more importantly, poor accountability. As we review all our systems, the story remains the same since 1975. Good at producing plans and strategies, we allocate budgets, but results often fall short of our commitments to our people,” he added.
With his term to last until 2027, making him the second longest serving Prime Minister after Sir Michael Somare, he does not want to repeat the same mistake – instead his cabinet has created the National Monitoring and Coordination Authority to ensure the good use of government funds in the years going forward.
“That is why we are not reinventing the wheel. There used to be national monitoring authority before.
“We are still monitoring parts of our nation's economy, not just writing checks for the planning department. In fact, the planning department should not be writing checks. But we have been consumed with writing checks, receiving checks, and spending. No one is really interested about monitoring what is happening amongst us. That has been the biggest deficiency we've carried thus far.
“And for me, speaking as your number one servant, by May 30th, 2027, I will be the second-longest serving prime minister, second only to Somare. Somare would have served nine years. I would have served eight years. And so it is guilt written over me.
“And to all of us, if we do not know what is happening to the public funds that has passed through our care, then NMCA comes in to fill in these gaps that remain amidst us.
“Budgets must align to plans. Plans must be implemented as approved. Loose ends must be closed so that every program is delivering on expected outcomes.”
“ If there is any government who will come after me, it is our duty as watchmen of our people's resources to account for every spend that we've spent,” the Prime Minister stressed.
One of his government’s agenda has been to grow the economy, and he says he does not want this effort to be wasted through corrupt practices, hence NMCA is vital to monitor and scrutinize government projects.
“I will create a section under my department - Department of Prime Minister, working with the NMCA, deploying and utilizing independent audit firms out there, independent engineering firms out there, independent accounting firms, and of course, not being government checking government.
“Government will not check government. And so NMCA is not going to check your government agencies. Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Anderson & Young, or Snowy River Mountain, the engineering firm, they're going to engage the private sector.
“Come and follow the money trail and check what is happening out there,”"

Marape welcomes court ruling,14/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5642,"Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed yesterday’s National Court ruling confirming that the former Chairman of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL), Dr Benedict Yaru, has no legal standing to continue in that role, having already served the maximum terms permitted under the law.
The Court found that Dr Yaru had served two full terms — a total of nine years — and that the Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited Authorisation Act 2015 “does not allow for a third term for directors other than the Managing Director.”
The Court also held that Dr Yaru “is not authorised to commence proceedings on behalf of the other directors” and struck out his case accordingly.
Prime Minister Marape commended the Court’s decision.
“I commend the Court for its clear and decisive ruling. Let this be a reminder to all of us — in leadership, business, and the community — that we must follow the law at all times. No one is above it,” the Prime Minister said.
The ruling follows the Government’s appointment in July 2025 of Mr Gerea Aopi as the new Chairman of KPHL, a decision that Dr Yaru challenged in court. With the matter now resolved, the Prime Minister said the newly appointed Board can focus on its work.
“The new Board will get to work immediately to ensure our petroleum assets are managed with integrity, transparency, and in the best interests of all Papua New Guineans,” he said."
Former KPHL board chair’s application rejected,14/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5641,"The Waigani National Court struck out a summons application filed by former Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited board chairman Dr Benedict Yaru, challenging Prime Minister James Marape’s appointment of new board chairman Gerea Aopi.
Justice Pauline Bre struck out the summons for being defective in not obtaining leave before filing the application, pursuant to Order 8 rule 50 of the National Court rules.
Order 8, rule 50 provides for leave to be obtained first before amending any document.
Lawyer representing Marape Dane Mel, submitted that the jurisdictional basis of amending the originating summons requires leave to be obtained before filing the amended originating summons. He submitted that no leave was obtained, and the amended originating summons was not properly before the court.
Dr Yaru counsel, Jonathan Holingu, in response, referred the Court to the background of the proceeding and clarified that this proceeding was filed as an urgent response to a media release by Marape the day before July 20, 2025, which announced the appointment of a new board chairman, Mr Aopi.
Holingu further argued that KPHL should be treated as a commercial entity and that Dr Yaru was still a director under the KPHL Act pursuant to section 108. Section 108 refers to occupying the position of a director.
“Dr Yaru’s term as a director of KPHL expired on September 3, 2023. He has no legal standing to challenge the Prime Minister's decision as the Trustee to appointing Aopi on June 10 and KPHL directors on June 26, 2025.”
“I therefore exercise my discretion pursuant to Order 10 rule 9A (15) (1) (a) and (2) (e) of the National Court Rules to summarily dismiss the proceedings for being incompetent for lacking standing and representational capacity,” Bre said.
The orders are,
1. The summons filed on 25 July 2025 is struck out for being defective in not obtaining leave before filing it, pursuant to Order 8 rule 50 of the National Court Rules.
2. The entire proceeding is summarily disposed pursuant to Order 10 Rule 9A(15)(1)(a) and (2) (e) of the National Court Rules as the plaintiff, Dr Bendict Yaru, does not have locus standi to bring the current action and the proceeding is not a duly constituted representative action.
3. Costs are awarded to the defendant to be paid by the plaintiff on a party/party basis.
4. Time for entry of these orders is abridged to the date of settlement by the Registrar of the National Court which shall take place, forthwith.
5. An administrative order is issued for the Registrar to close and archive the Court File as soon as practicable."

PNGUoT Students to Face Administrative and Legal Action,13/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5634,"The students from PNG University of Technology (PNGUoT) who were identified in the harassment incident on Saturday will be dealt with both administratively and legally.
The university’s senior executive management hosted a press conference this afternoon in Lae, where they emphasised that the two processes will run simultaneously.
The harassment of the young woman on Saturday night has brought disrepute to an institution that has been working hard to raise its standards in both curriculum and infrastructure.
Pro vice chancellor – administration, Prof Kaul Gena, detailed that the management held a number of meetings with students to address the August 9th incident. The first one was on the night of Monday, August 11th, with female students.
“On Monday night, the management team went and had a conversation with them and gave the assurance that we are not going to sit here and allow very few students to derail and destroy the reputation of the university,” he stated.
“We gave the assurance to the female students that anybody who is seen to be violating or breaking any student rule will be disciplined.
“We had a forum with both male and female students at Duncanson Hall today. The management team spoke to them that what happened on Saturday night was unacceptable and the council and management strongly condemn that behaviour and we appealed to both male and female students that we have to work together to address the damage that has been caused by a very few students.
“We have a student population of just over 3,300 on campus and because we had a debate and religious program going on at the same time, the small incident attracted a mob.
“The students have come on board to help management identify those who had physically and verbally harassed the innocent woman. Their names are before the police. We have submitted a report so the police and police CID are doing their own investigation to identify and charge them.”
Prof Gena said today, two students were called into the security office, where it is believed that they were arrested and will have to follow due process to get themselves cleared.
Investigation is ongoing, with the management team clarifying that the five initial students who were identified will face the criminal process as well as the university’s internal student disciplinary process. Both processes will run in parallel.
Vice Chancellor, Prof Ora Renagi, emphasised that the university is now working on damage control and crisis management.
“We are very focused on our vision; we will continue to be a world-class university but we have challenges, like this issue,” Prof Renagi told Lae media.
“We will make sure that while justice is served, we have to make progress in rebuilding our reputation.
“The incident has been reported on social media and has reached our international stakeholders, and we are aware of the effect that it will have on our bilateral and multilateral partners and universities overseas.
“The world over is always focused on ensuring that the human values are upheld everywhere, including the universities. Particularly for the universities, we should be at the forefront of demonstrating – from staff to students to community – that our human values are upheld. That the Sustainable Development Goals are addressed and we make progress to ensure that we have a better society to live in.”"

He thanked his competitors and spoke about his aspirations, now that he’s been given the opportunity to lead the district.
Mr. Kumura recounted how he contested since 2017 but has never won andt how he has never given up, driven by people’s struggles.
Being a very challenging district g locality given the tough geographical terrains,  Mr. Kumura reaffirmed his intentions to serve Usino Bundi district, putting into use the many years of acquired skills, knowledge and connections.

Incomplete Maprik District Hospital Queried,13/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5629,"Health Minister, Elias Kapavore has promised to send a team to Maprik to assess the status of the Maprik District Hospital and provide a full report to him.
After almost a decade, the Maprik District hospital is yet to be completed and was the subject of discussion in parliament last week Friday.
Member for Maprik, Libert Kapris told parliament that initial work to construct the Maprik District Hospital began in 2016. The project was valued at K8.1 million at that time but to date, it remains incomplete.
MP Kapris in raising this concern said according to the documents, the cause of the delay in the completion of this vital infrastructure is because of outstanding payments to the contractor.
“This district hospital will serve a population of 8,000 plus - a population that is rapidly increasing each year due to the increase in economic activities in the region. It will also serve other neighboring districts within the Central Sepik region.
“The only health centre in Maprik is always congested and is not able to fully cater for the increasing population. This situation is seriously affecting many women and children and is very critical.
“Can the NDoH evaluate, review, and value the abandoned project if so, when? When can NDoH settle the contractor on the outstanding fees? When can we expect contractor to commence work?”
Minister for Health in response, confirmed that the project was supposed to be completed within 18months from initial work in 2016. As of today, it is 65% with only K55 in the project account.
“Yes, it’s a concern. About nine years now and the project is 65% complete. I will send a team from the department of Health especially the facilities grant team to revisit Maprik and look at the particular infrastructure and give a full report on what needs to be done. I am aware that there was a 10million-kina awarded to this particular project by the government last year. However, that funding was not released but this is an important project and I affirm that it will commence very soon.”"

The Asset Restraint and Recovery Working (ARROW) Group brings together specialist officers from the Bank of PNG Financial Analysis and Supervision Unit, the RPNGC National Fraud and Anti-Corruption Directorate, and the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
The arrangement was formalised through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the three agencies that establishes a framework for co-location in a secure RPNGC facility.
""ARROW will investigate suspicious financial transactions and gather evidence that will be used in court to freeze accounts, seize assets and initiate restraining order applications,"" Commissioner Manning confirmed.
""Legislation is in place to confiscate the proceeds of crime and ARROW has been established to make this happen.
""This is the first time these three agencies will work together from the same location. It enables much more effective inter-agency collaboration and improve effectiveness in the identification, tracing, and recovery of assets under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2022.""
Commissioner Manning highlighted that face-to-face collaboration enables faster decision-making so that matters can be prosecuted in court and assets seized before criminals can try and hide them.
""With the ARROW Group, we can plan the seizure of assets from initial investigation through to prosecution and avoid the delays and miscommunications that can come from working in different locations.
""Criminals who benefit from corruption, drugs, weapons, stolen goods and other illegal activities face the real prospect that they will lose their houses, vehicles and money in their bank accounts without warning.
""In the modern era of communications and surveillance, criminals are not able to hide the proceeds of their crimes as had been the case in the past and they are on notice.”
Manning said confiscating the assets and money of criminals has been effective in other countries and has widespread public support.
""Those officers working within the ARROW Group have been given clear directions. Hit criminals where it hurts, seize assets, freeze bank accounts and take the profit out of crime,"" Manning added."

ENB to commemorate two events in September,12/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5612,"East New Britain Province is set to host two historic events in September: the 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations on September 16 and the commemoration of the 1994 Twin Volcano Eruption on September 19.
These milestone occasions honour Papua New Guinea’s nationhood and the province’s resilience in the face of natural disaster.
The 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations will be held at the Somare Memorial Birth Site in Rapindik, located in front of the hot springs and the iconic Mt Tavurvur Volcano. This site is significant as the birthplace of PNG’s founding father and first Prime Minister, the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare.

ENB women candidates commended,12/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5610,"The president of the Council of Women in East New Britain has commended the efforts of women candidates contesting the local level government and ward elections this year.
Beverly Dam, who is also the provincial women’s representative in the provincial government, said she is proud to see a good number of women putting their hands up, to run for both the LLG president and ward member seats.
The PNG Electoral Commission office in the province had received a total of 49 female candidates, including eight for the LLG president seats.
This is also the largest number of female candidates that have ever contested in the elections in the province; both in the national and LLG elections.
Gazelle, being the largest district by population in the province, registered the highest number with 23 female candidates, including five contesting four of the eight LLG president seats in the district.
The two smaller districts of Kokopo and Rabaul recorded three and 19, respectively. Both districts also have a mayor’s seat each for Kokopo City and Rabaul town.
Kokopo district has three women contesting for ward member seats in only one of its four LLGs, while there are 18 candidates vying for ward member seats in all four LLGs of Rabaul district.
Rabaul district also registered a sole female candidate in the LLG president seat.
Having the largest landmass in the province, Pomio district only recorded two candidates each for the ward member seats in two wards and one of the seven LLG president seats.
Mrs. Dam said that often women can lead, but they tend to lack knowledge and information on what they are required to do in those important government offices.
“Most of them lack information on how they can lead their wards and LLGs. So, in the last two-and-a-half years, as we were going about, sorting out issues surrounding the Provincial Council of Women, we advocated on how women can participate in this male-dominated field of the elections.
“We also did some training on the government system, its structures and the processes of how the government runs its business.
“And as per the feedback we got from the participants, the lack of such vital information had created a barrier for more women to take part in the elections over the years.”
She said a lot of the women in the province are already in leadership roles in the various sectors of society, except in the political space.
Mrs Dam further iterated that being the only female representative in the provincial government posed a big challenge to her, in that it indicated the need for more women's voices at that political or decision-making level.
As a way forward, she urged more women to take up leadership roles in the political arena, beginning at the community and ward level.
With the re-establishment of the ENB Council of Women, Mrs Dam assured that more assistance would be given to women leaders in the province."

"Madang Governor Blasts ""Madness"" of Ramu Agri Taxes",10/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5596,"Madang Governor Ramsey Pariwa, has described the handling of Ramu Agri Industries taxes as “total madness” during Friday’s parliament sitting, after following up on the issue and the Ramu Nico mine lease.
According to Pariwa, Ramu Agri Industries is located in Madang Province, yet its taxes are paid to Morobe Province.
“What type of madness is this? What type of tax regime are we holding in this country, where the owner of the land is not receiving the tax, but another province is receiving it? Prime Minister, may you sort this issue with the tax and make sure the land owners receive the tax. This is daylight robbery,” Pariwa said.
In a second question, the Governor asked the Prime Minister if Madang could be included in the appointed state negotiation team to have a say in the extension of the Ramu Nico Mine lease.
Responding on behalf of the Treasurer, the Prime Minister referenced the Porgera Mine case, saying the government previously earned only 5% from Porgera under past agreements.
“I want to be clear, my record on Porgera is a testimony to what this government is resolving. In Porgera Mine the government was earning 5% which was the SML agreement. This government made correction and was made when the lease expired. I am not happy with the Ramu Nico agreement or Lihir Mining agreement, but we made agreements,” Marape Said.
He revealed there is a proposal to expand the Ramu Nico project through downstream processing elements, which would involve varying the project agreement to increase its scope.
“I want to assure the Governor for Madang, when we sit at the review table, then the people of Madang through the governor’s office will contribute their views into better benefit sharing agreement.”
Marape assured that as part of the government’s 50th anniversary reset, provinces hosting resource projects will see more equitable benefit-sharing and legal readjustments."

Secretary for Education, Dr. Uke Kombra, expressed immense gratitude to KPHL for the ""unique milestone"" partnership in supporting this vital program that will see 30 students sponsored to study in South Dakota State University, North Dakota State University, and the University of North Dakota in the United States.
The STEM Program, launched in 2020 with its first cohort beginning their studies in the six National Schools of Excellence in 2021, aims to send the top 5 percent of the best-performing students overseas to gain skills in areas that will help grow Papua New Guinea’s economy and drive innovation.
""We have basically been consuming the knowledge and research and all the skills are being created in overseas countries,"" Dr. Kombra stated, emphasizing the need for PNG to nurture its own intellectual capital.
The Secretary stated that currently, 208 Papua New Guinean students are studying overseas through the program, with 107 in the United States, 50 in China, 30 in India, and five in Fiji. In the US, students are enrolled in three universities – Nichols, North, and South Dakota – studying courses in petroleum, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medical fields that are very relevant for PNG’s future development.
Dr. Kombra highlighted that the program is a long-standing vision of the government, with Prime Minister James Marape having initiated the policy during his tenure as Minister for Education.
KPHL's commitment, Dr. Kombra noted, is a ""very visionary step"" and an investment that ""will bring value to our country."" The partnership between the Department of Education and KPHL is set for the next five years.
Looking ahead, the program plans to send a smaller number of students to Malaysia to study petrochemical and medicine, with other possibilities being explored carefully to ensure proper management.
Dr. Kombra also called on other corporate organisations, both private and public, to join KPHL in supporting this national cause. ""We are basically creating the capital for your own organization that you need for the next century,"" he urged, emphasizing the long-term benefits for the nation's industries.
Students participating in the program were encouraged to seize this ""very peculiar, very special opportunity"" and strive for excellence. Dr. Kombra challenged them to ""do something that’s different and not to come back as just a general engineer or a doctor,"" urging them to innovate and contribute significantly to PNG's knowledge-based economy.
He also called on them to be good ambassadors for PNG and abide by the rules and regulations of the institutions they are studying in and the communities they are living in or risk having their sponsorship terminated.
Meanwhile, KPHL Managing Director, Mr. Wapu Sonk said, “This is an example of how, as the national petroleum and energy company is actively transferring the wealth generated from development of our natural resources to improving human capital and social development in our country.”
Mr. Sonk added that KPHL’s five-year support for the STEM Scholarship Program will cost K150 million and reflects the company’s long-term commitment to human capital development in support of the Marape/Rosso government policy. By investing in the next generation of scientists and engineers, we are investing in the future of our country.”"

Call for Bicameral System,09/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5587,"Members of Parliament commemorated the 41st anniversary of the National Parliament House yesterday. During parliament recommendations were made for a bicameral system in the house of parliament, however, foundations need to be set for such changes in the next 50 years.
According to the United Kingdom Parliament, a bicameral system in parliament means that the legislature is divided into two separate houses or chamber. This is typically called the Upper House and the Lower House and is practiced in the USA, the UK, Australia, Canada and Italy.
“50 years this year I think we will now have to relook at how the unicameral system in the peoples house served us. I believe the 3 arms of government influenced the legislature, I think this calls for hard research,” said Member for Abau, Puka Temu.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop agreed.
“We need a bicameral system, the proposal to have governors in the upper house is a good proposal because it brings challenge on each other. A lot of times government since I came, we support the government blindly,” said the Governor for NCD.
Advantages of a bicameral system is checks and balances to avoid dominance, prevent poorly considered chambers, better representation, thorough debate and review, and the division of responsibility in the parliament.
Member for Ialibu-Pangia, Peter O’Neill, added that change can come about with a restructure like the bicameral system, however foundations need to be set in parliament for such changes in the next 50 years.
O’Neill said, “As we move on to the next 50 years, we need to set the foundation this term over the next two years it will shape our future. Whether we have an upper house or lower house we have to separate the executive government from parliament, were parliament can hold executive government to account.”
“For a small country like PNG, we have too many ministers. It works for us politics but not for the nation. We must not be afraid to make these changes. Why I say this, is because we won’t be here forever,” he added."

“Their recovery has been steady, and this achievement marks a national breakthrough in medical care. ”The significance of this milestone was underscored by Prime Minister James Marape, who visited the operating theatre during the second surgery and met with the first donor and recipient. He commended their courage and the role they played in making medical history for Papua New Guinea.
The surgeries were led by PNG’s own urologists and trained transplant surgeons, Dr. Damien Hasola, Dr. Sidney James, and Dr. Chris Munguas, alongside transplant specialists from TLC, Dr. Benjamin Lindsey and Dr. Jonathan Ellis.
The success was made possible through the unified efforts of PMGH’s multidisciplinary team, including anesthesiologists, nurses, doctors, pathologists, radiologists, and support staff.
Dr. Hoxson Okti Poki, Chairman of the Kidney Transplant Program Steering Committee (KTPSC), stated: “This groundbreaking procedure, positions Papua New Guinea as the first Pacific Island nation to successfully undertake an organ transplant. It reaffirms the Marape Government’s commitment to delivering world-class specialist health services domestically.”
These procedures could not have taken place without the generous financial assistance of the National Fisheries Authority that contributed K10milion to PMGH to support the delivery of kidney transplant services."

Serah Molowia Karu (Miss Keipi) and Monica Julius Maravila (Miss Tairuma) were recipients of book donations from BbP as part of this year’s Book Week campaign.
The two young women, known not only for their poise but their passion for education and youth development, reached out to BbP seeking support to uplift literacy in their local communities.
Recognising their dedication, BbP responded with donated books and praised the women for being positive role models.
“We commend both Miss Serah and Miss Monica for their heartfelt passion and advocacy,” BbP said.
“At Buk bilong Pikinini, we believe that improving literacy is a responsibility shared by everyone — donor partners, organisations, and individuals alike.”
Miss Karu reflected on the impact of the donation, “Strength in diversity, power in knowledge and beauty in action... The children in Keipi will now be inspired to dream big.”
Miss Maravila added, “Books open doors to worlds beyond our own... Your donation is not just a gift of books, but a gift of opportunity for every child in Tairuma.”
This partnership is part of BbP’s nationwide celebration of Book Week, running from August 11 to 15, under the theme ""My Future Career – When I Grow Up I Want to Be a..."".
The campaign introduces children to a variety of professions through BbP’s “When I Grow Up” reader series, which now includes 30 titles. Five new books — featuring careers from chefs to mechanics — will be launched during the week.
Supported by the Sir Brian Bell Foundation, Wild Dog Books (Australia), and visiting editor Maryann Ballantyne, the event showcases the transformative power of literacy and the influence of young leaders like Karu and Maravila."
Sir Michael’s work spoke volumes: Arthur Somare,08/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5581,"Arthur Somare, son of Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare described his father as a quiet and humble man, who was not boastful but let examples of his work speak volumes.
Speaking at the unveiling of Sir Michael’s monument yesterday evening, Mr Somare said Sir Michael carried a quiet confidence that came from being deeply grounded in the values of respect, dialogue, and Christian faith.
“Tonight, we unveil more than a statue—we unveil a symbol. A symbol of dignity, humility, courage, and unity. We immortalise in bronze not just the founding father of our nation, but the very embodiment of what it means to lead with honour, compassion, and vision.”
Mr Somare further said his father was not perfect, but was constant in his love for this country.
“And for that, we honour him – not as a distant historical figure, but as a leader whose shadow still falls upon this place, and whose spirit continues to whisper to our national conscience,” he said.
Mr Somare reminded leaders who attended the event that Sir Michael always reminded us that independence is not just about political freedom, rights, and liberties—it is the enduring hope for economic sovereignty and the right to stand on our own two feet as a nation.
“My father, the Grand Chief, often reminded us that political independence is meaningless unless it translates into the tangible improvement of the lives of ordinary citizens.
“He believed that no constitution, no law, and no political milestone could carry meaning unless it helped to uplift the lives and living conditions of the people—especially those who had been forgotten or left behind.
“He believed that leadership is not about power. It is not about status. It is, above all else, about service. And it must be rooted in humility, integrity, and an unwavering belief in fairness and justice.
“That is the legacy we are called to live up to,” he said.
Mr Somare called on all Papua New Guineans to see beyond their tribes and provinces, and embrace the idea that what unites them as Papua New Guineans is far greater than what divides them.
“That was Sir Michael’s vision. And that is what this statue must remind us of every single day.”"
PM reflects on Sir Michael’s legacies,08/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5578,"Prime Minister James Marape has described the unveiling of a national monument for the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare as a moment of solemn reflection and recommitment to the founding values of Papua New Guinea.
Speaking during an official ceremony held in front of Parliament House in Port Moresby yesterday evening, Marape said the bronze monument was not merely a physical structure, but a national symbol representing unity, humility, service, and the enduring spirit of self-determination.
The statue, produced and cast in Indonesia, was the result of extensive collaboration between Indonesian artisans and the PNG government.
The prime minister said the monument stands as a symbol not only of Sir Michael’s contributions but also of the enduring relationship between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia — neighbours with a shared border, shared history, and growing bilateral partnership.
He added that the monument should serve as a civic space and a national beacon to inspire future generations.
“Today we do not just unveil a statue carved out of bronze,” Prime Minister Marape told the gathering. “We enshrine the memory of a man whose life carved into destiny our nation.
“The monument, which now stands facing the National Parliament, honours the life and leadership of Grand Chief Sir Michael Thomas Somare, the country’s first Prime Minister and founding father.”
The Prime Minister further stated that Sir Michael was not only a political leader, but a unifying figure whose leadership turned a complex, fragmented colony into a single, sovereign nation.
“Sir Michael was a bridge between time and tradition.
“He connected a country of one thousand tribes and cultures into one national identity — one people, one country, one nation.”
“He bridged our colonial past with an independent future, not through upheaval, but through deliberate dialogue and patient diplomacy,” Prime Minister said.
He said Sir Michael’s approach to independence was marked not by violence, but by dialogue, diplomacy, and faith in the people of Papua New Guinea.
The prime minister also used the occasion to remind elected officials, public servants, and all citizens of their responsibility to uphold the values for which Sir Michael stood.
“This is a reminder of the duty we have for the construction of our country,” he said.
“Let us never allow the foundations he laid to be eroded by greed, disunity, complacency, or corruption.”
He called for continued unity across political and regional divides and encouraged a renewed spirit of nationhood as Papua New Guinea approaches its 50th Independence Anniversary.
“This is not just a day of remembrance,” he said.
“It is a day of recommitment to the ideals of humility, unity in diversity, and service above self.”"
U.S. Aids UXO Cleanup,08/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5575,"The United States Government is ramping up support to Papua New Guinea in clearing explosive remnants of war (ERW), investing in both training and clearance operations to protect lives and restore land for safe community use.
A five-week Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) training program—concluded on July 25—was delivered by U.S. Marines from the 1st Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Company of the I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF). Held in Port Moresby and various locations across PNG, the training focused on enhancing the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF)’s ability to safely identify, handle, and destroy unexploded ordnance (UXO) and other remnants of war.
""The United States is proud to support Humanitarian Mine Action efforts in Papua New Guinea,” said Col. Baskins, senior defense official and Defense Attaché with the U.S. Embassy Port Moresby. “These programs reflect our commitment to a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific, and strengthens the partnership between our two nations.""
Participants were trained in ordnance identification, safe handling procedures, controlled demolitions, and emergency responses. “It has been a great experience working alongside the PNGDF. Their dedication is inspiring,” said Staff Sergeant Mueller, EOD Team Leader from the 7th Engineer Support Battalion.
In a separate but complementary initiative, the U.S. Government has committed a USD $2.25 million (PGK 9.2 million) grant to the HALO Trust to expand UXO remediation activities in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville and Oro Province. The grant will fund survey and mapping operations, national UXO tracking, community risk education, and the excavation of hazardous areas.
The HALO Trust signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with Bougainville authorities in June and is expected to finalize a similar agreement with Oro Province soon. Their operations aim to reduce the risk of injury or death caused by decades-old munitions left over from World War II.
The U.S. first provided UXO assistance to PNG in 2009, when its Quick Reaction Force destroyed 2,727 UXO items and small arms ammunition in Torokina, Bougainville. These sustained efforts underscore the U.S.’s long-term commitment to supporting PNG’s development and regional security goals."

These security forces are tasked with safeguarding the counting centre, maintaining peace, and preventing any disruptions during this critical phase.
All contending candidates have assured their supporters will remain within designated perimeters and will manage their own security arrangements. Their cooperation is vital to maintaining a peaceful environment and upholding the integrity of the process.
“As the Provincial Police Commander of Madang, I sincerely appreciate the assurances from all candidates to maintain peace and security during this period. I also commend polling officials, the Provincial Administrator Daniel Aloi and all stakeholders for their support and dedication, enabling the successful completion of polling despite minor operational challenges,” Baim stated.
“I call on everyone involved to uphold this spirit of cooperation and peace during the counting phase. It is our collective responsibility to ensure a credible and transparent process, leading to a legitimate outcome that will be determined by the counts in the coming days,” stressed the PPC.
On Day 3, the situation on ground remains stable with no major incidences."

National Parliament House Marks 41 Years,07/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5557,"Today marks 41 years when the National Parliament House was first opened on August 07, 1984. To commemorate this day, a host of activities have been planned for today, starting with the Clerk and Speaker’s welcome in the morning at the parliament State Function Room.
During his speech, Speaker Job Pomat when giving his speech said the National Parliament House is a representation of democracy, identity, and national unity.

“It is a timely and meaningful reminder that, despite our many cultures, languages, and regions, we are united as one people under one Constitution, one flag, and one Parliament,” said Pomat.
The Parliament House, opened on August 7, 1984 by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, now His Majesty King Charles III, was built not only as a place for decision-making—but as a house for all the people of Papua New Guinea.
It stands at the heart of the nation—a place where leaders, elected by the people, come together to debate, legislate, and shape the future of this country.
The National Parliament House has been more than just a seat of government—it has been the stage upon which PNG’s young democracy has grown over four decades,.
It has witnessed:
-	The peaceful transition of governments,
-	The passing of laws that define  the country’s progress,
-	The approval of national budgets, and most importantly,
-	the voicing of people’s hopes and concerns.

Duma explains sale of MVIL shares in BSP,07/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5555,"Minister for State Enterprises, William Duma was yesterday (Wednesday, 06 August 2025) asked to explain why Motor Vehicle Insurance Limited shares in BSP were sold. Social media speculations prompted the Member for Menyamya, Solen Loifa to raise this in parliament during question time.
Minister Duma’s response included assuring the government and the people that the money would be put to good use.
Duma was asked why these shares were sold when BSP was doing well. Minister Duma in defending the sale said it was done transparently, was competitive and compliant with relevant laws, including the Kumul Consolidated Holdings Act.
He then said MVIL and KCH have held significant shareholdings in BSP for many years and it was the right time to evolve this ownership.
“The government doesn’t own any shares in BSP, those shares were held by MVIL a completely different company so we need to get that correct.”
“You can be a shareholder in a company but that does not necessarily mean you hold those shares forever. As an investor there comes a time where you can make a decision to sell those shares at a good price, when the shares are performing well you sell out and make the money. That was a commercial decision made by both boards of KCH and MVIL and finally approved by cabinet.”
Duma said shares were purchased by over 50 different PNG investors, made up of PNG companies and individuals through JMP Securities Ltd as one of the country’s two licensed stockbrokers. He said priority was given to domestic investors.
“There needed to be a sell down to help Kumul Consolidated Holdings fund projects worth a billion-kina like the aging infrastructure of PNG Power right throughout the country. We don’t want to ask the government for funding again and that is why we made that decision.”
Four key objectives of sale were outlined in the statement including Fiscal Consolidations, Portfolio rebalancing, market development and focus on core functions."

Porgera Infrastructure Damage Recognized as Terrorism by PNG Law,06/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5551,"The destruction of public infrastructure and threats to key national roads in Porgera have now been officially branded as acts of terrorism by the Controller of the Porgera State of Emergency, Chief Superintendent, Joseph Tondop.
In a strongly worded statement issued yesterday, Tondop confirmed that the recent hijacking of ballot boxes and destruction of two bridges in Mulitaka during the by-election were serious criminal acts and are now under investigation.
The incident occurred on 18 July 2025, when armed supporters of some candidates in Mulitaka hijacked eight ballot boxes being transported for council ward elections. The ballot papers were reportedly tampered with and then returned to Paiam Police Station. In retaliation, supporters of rival candidates destroyed two bridges leading into Porgera.
“These are serious crimes. Two wrongs do not make a right,” Tondop said.
He confirmed that the matter was referred to the Electoral Commissioner, who, on 31 July 2025, ruled that the tampered boxes would be excluded from the counting process.
However, those who hijacked the boxes have rejected this decision and are now threatening to destroy the vital Wabag-Porgera bridge, a critical transport link for the Porgera Gold Mine and the broader economy.
“I take these threats very seriously and have already directed State Security Forces into Mulitaka to secure the bridge,” Tondop stated.
He stressed that any destruction or threat to destroy critical infrastructure constitutes terrorism under Papua New Guinea’s Counter Terrorism Act 2024, with bridges legally defined as critical infrastructure.
“ I will not tolerate any act that threatens innocent lives and the national economy,” he said.
Tondop has made three key recommendations to the Police Commissioner:
•	Declare Mulitaka and its surrounding areas a Prohibited Area;
•	 Declare individuals supporting the destruction of the bridge as members of a terrorist organisation;
•	Recognise all actions taken in Mulitaka as meeting the legal definition of terrorism.
Tondop called on all Mulitaka candidates to publicly direct their supporters to stand down and refrain from any criminal activity, warning that inaction could itself be a crime.
“Papua New Guinea is a country of laws. I have sworn to uphold these laws, and I will enforce them to their fullest extent,” Tondop added."

Court revokes K7000 bail granted to Ekip,06/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5546,"The Waigani District Court today revoked a bail that was granted to suspect Benjamin Ekip, after he was released on a police bail of K7000 on Monday, 04 August 2025.
Ekip is alleged to have assaulted the Managing Director of Kana Construction, Roxon Undi at the Ela Beach Hotel on 26 July, 2025.
Police prosecutor, Tau Azariah, made a submission at the Waigani Committal Court today, asking the court to revoke a police bail of K7000 by the suspect, who is now out of custody.
Constable Tau in this submission cited the lack of proper bail process by Ekip. Given the seriousness of the charges, Ekip should have sought bail at the courts, and not a police bail.
Ekip did not appear in court to explain how he got out on bail without following the proper bail process.
Presiding Magistrate, Tracy Ganaii granted the application of Constable Tau and adjourned the matter for hearing tomorrow, where further directions will be issued.
Mr Ekip was charged with one count of actual physical possession of a firearm and one count of threatening to discharge a firearm.
The charges arise from a July 26, 2025 incident at the Ela Beach Hotel carpark, where Mr. Ekip allegedly pursued and attempted to shoot Undi, and his employee while armed and intoxicated. The victims took cover behind their vehicle before Black Swan security personnel intervened and disarmed the suspect.
Kana Construction condemned the act and urged for justice to prevail while expressing concern over the escalating misuse of firearms in public spaces."
Honouring the Flag’s Forgotten Designer,06/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5545,"As Papua New Guinea prepares to celebrate its 50th Independence Anniversary on September 16th, a call for long-overdue recognition has emerged — one deeply rooted in the nation’s identity.
The family of the late Susan Karike, designer of the PNG national flag, is appealing to the government and the people to finally acknowledge the life and legacy of the woman behind one of the country’s most powerful symbols.
Susan Karike was only 15 years old when she designed the flag that would go on to represent a proud, independent Papua New Guinea. Her work has been flown high above government buildings, schools, and homes for half a century now, yet her contribution remains one of the least recognised.
“Susan Karike, as a young girl, designed the flag that has represented our country for half a century. It's a symbol that unites us, from the mountains to the islands. Yet, for so long, her incredible contribution went without the proper recognition it deserved.
It was a tragic reality that she never received the national acknowledgement she was due in her lifetime,” her family said in a heartfelt statement.
As the country prepares for its Golden Jubilee, her family sees this historic milestone as the perfect opportunity to honour her legacy in a formal and national way.
“As we approach this Golden Jubilee, this 50-year milestone, we, the people of the Late Susan Karike, feel it is the perfect time to rectify this. We believe that this anniversary isn't just about celebrating the past, but also about honoring the people who built it. Susan Karike's story is a foundational part of that history,” they said.
The family is calling for her story to be written into national history books and taught across schools in Papua New Guinea, so that her name and contribution are passed on to generations to come.
“Our greatest wish, our deepest hope, is that her work and her contributions can finally be written down in the history books of Papua New Guinea. We want her story to be taught in schools. We want this generation, and all the generations that follow, to know who designed the flag they salute every day. It's a matter of national pride and historical accuracy.”
The push to honour Susan Karike comes not just from a place of family pride, but from a desire to preserve national memory and celebrate unsung heroes.
“Remembering Susan Karike's legacy is not just about our family; it's about all of us as Papua New Guineans. It's about ensuring that the stories of our heroes, particularly our unsung heroes, are never forgotten. We believe that by honoring her, we honor the very spirit of our independence.”
As the nation prepares to raise its flag once again in celebration, there is a growing sense that this year, more than ever, is the time to also raise the story of the young woman who created it."
PNG - NZ Celebrate Friendship with Plaque Unveiling,06/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5544,"In commemorating the 50 years of friendship between two Pacific Countries, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, the Prime Minister of New Zealand dedicated his trip to Port Moresby to celebrating this milestone.

Dulciana Somare Brash who represented the mother and siblings expressed gratefulness to the New Zealand High Commission and the Prime Minister for honoring the footprint of their father by erecting this plaque.
“It’s been four years since his passing but his fifty, almost sixty years legacy remains with us. I understand that  today is the day that the Prime Minister of New Zealand, late Sir Robert Muldoon, it’s 33 years since his passing, and the 5th of August is a very important day for us in the family, but also as we walk and follow the footsteps of our dear late father we are reminded of his hard work and his vision, the importance of the bilateral relations that he locked down,” said Dulcianna.
Prime Minister for New Zealand Christopher Luxon in response said he was proud of what their father has done for this country as the founding father and thanked them for being present to represent him and their family in the event.
PM Luxon went on to acknowledge the NZ High Commission staff past and present both here and in New Zealand for the great work they had done in establishing the High Commission here in Papua New Guinea who have worked to build the bilateral relations over the years.
“I’m really delighted to be able to join the unveiling of the plaque which tells of the significance of this tree, planted on the day that the high commission chancery was opened 42 years ago. It’s significance as we talked about esteemed from being planted by none other than ‘papa bilong country, Sir Great Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, and by one of our own Prime Ministers, Sir Robert Muldoon,” Prime Minister Luxon said.
The plaque was unveiled jointly by New Zealand Prime Minister, Christopher Luxon and Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, James Marape."

Kavieng stadium renamed ‘Sir Julius Chan stadium’,06/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5540,"The Kavieng Sports Stadium at the Kopkop show ground in New Ireland has been officially renamed to Sir Julius Chan Stadium in honour of one of the country’s founding fathers and political icon late Sir Julius Chan.
New Ireland Provincial Member Walter D Schnaubelt announced this during the New Ireland Day celebrations held at the Kavieng Stadium last Saturday, August 02, 2025.
“It is fitting and proper to announce here today that the Kavieng Sports Stadium will now be named in honour and legacy of our late Governor Sir Julius Chan,” he said.
Late Sir Julius built this amazing facility that has set a high benchmark for development in New Ireland for years to come.
The Kavieng Stadium took just over a year to build by the China Railway Construction Company, the same company that built another iconic structure in the New Ireland Legislative Assembly.
The renaming of the stadium was one of the highlights of the New Ireland Day celebrations bringing together traditional and cultural performances from the two districts (Kavieng and Namatanai) in the province.
Governor Schnaubelt said plans are currently underway to have the Sir Julius Chan Stadium meet international standards in order to host rugby league fixtures and other sporting codes as well.
“We will maintain the Sir Julius Chan Stadium and potentially develop new ones such as the Konos and Namatanai stadiums to meet international standards as well as the needs of various sports disciplines,” Schnaubelt noted.
Governor Schnaubelt also would like to see New Ireland hosting intercity cup matches or Hunters game once improvements to the turf and the stadium generally have been attended to.
The adjacent field at the present Kopkop market will also be brought up to standard where soccer and other games can be hosted.
The Governor’s vision is one day to make New Ireland the rugby 9s and 7s capital of PNG, similar to the Hong Kong 7s."

Morobe’s provincial program adviser for education, Keith Tangui, expressed frustration that an incident that could have been settled in an amicable manner has spiralled out of control, directly affecting nearly 2,000 students.
“We have Markham Road as a junior high school and I do not wish to see that school face a problem like that,” he stated. “It’s an urban school.

PM JAMES MARAPE REAFFIRMS UNITY AND REGIONAL EMPOWERMENT AT SIGNING OF 2025 PORT MORESBY PAPUA ACCO...,05/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5533,"Prime Minister Hon. James Marape has reaffirmed his Government's
unwavering commitment to National Unity, Regional Empowerment, and Inclusive Development during the  historic Signing of the 2025 Port Moresby Papua Accord, held today at the State Function Room, Parliament House.
The Signing, which marks a significant milestone following the outcomes of the Papua Governors’ Dialogue, brought together key national and regional leaders from the Southern or Papuan Region of the country, ahead of Papua New Guinea’s 50th Independence anniversary celebrations next month.
In his address, Prime Minister Marape acknowledged the contributions of Papuan leaders, past and present, and emphasized that the strength of PNG lies in its diversity and unity.
“Fifty years on, our nation calls for greater unity than division,” PM Marape declared. “Diversity builds and not destroys. Diversity harnesses talents and mobilizes resources and human ingenuity for our country to prosper.”
He thanked Chairlady of the Parliamentary Governors' Council, and Central Governor Hon. Rufina Peter, and all Governors from the Papuan Region for their leadership and partnership in regional dialogue. “To all Parliament Governors, to all Members of Parliament from the Papuan region of our country, I thank you for
embracing this conversation of progress and unity,” he said.
Referencing the United States as an example of a nation built on diversity, the Prime Minister noted, “The greatest democracy and economy today was built not by language or tribe, but on the principle of human equality embedded in Christian values.”PM Marape acknowledged the foundational roles played by Papua in PNG’s journey to independence:
“Right from day one, the Papuan side has contributed to the country as much as the New Guinea side. If you count the divide of Papuan territory and New Guinea territory, Papua has had four Prime Ministers — Bill Skate, Mekere Morauta, Peter O’Neill and myself.”
He urged the country to look beyond artificial divides and recognize the deep ancestral and trade connections among the regions:
“We were a people before there was a Papua. We were a people before there was a New Guinea. Let us step away from the notion of a Papua–New Guinea divide.”
Marape also used the occasion to call for full utilization of existing legal powers by Provincial Governments under the Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-level Governments. “Since 1995, when has one Provincial Government utilized its powers? If it hasn't happened, where is the problem? Pangu Party borne Provincial Governments after Independence to unite the country, not divide our country.”
He committed his Government to further decentralization and empowerment of Provinces, referencing Sections 42 and 44 of the Organic Law which grant wide-ranging powers to Governors and LLGs in education, health, land, tourism, agriculture, and resource management. On development, PM Marape announced that over K1 billion worth of infrastructure and connectivity projects are being rolled out across the Southern region, including road links from Port Moresby to Alotau,
Kikori and Kerema, to unlock tourism, agriculture, and trade.
He also highlighted new Export opportunities: “For the first time, Total is doing deep sea exploration at Mailu (Abau district). China has approved our coffee and seafood exports. Abau district in Central Province is now sending crabs directly to Singapore.”
Closing his remarks with a call to action, the Prime Minister challenged public servants and leaders alike:
“Let us not be talkers — let us be workers. The power lies in our hands. If we unlock these structural impediments together, we can grow the economy and better serve our people.”
Prime Minister Marape concluded with a heartfelt appreciation to the Papuan people:
“Thank you, thank you, thank you. You have played your fair share and carried us. Let us continue to work together in unity. God bless.”"
NZ PM expresses desire to strengthen PNG-NZ relationship,05/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5531,"New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon in addressing the PNG Parliament this morning indicated his government’s commitment to strengthening the PNG - New Zealand relationship and their joint endeavours.
Luxon expressed these sentiments considering the long relationship PNG has with New Zealand and the strategic location of PNG in the wider Pacific.
“Regionally, Papua New Guinea accounts for over three-quarters of the Pacific Islands landmass and almost two-thirds of its people. But your size means, where you go, the Pacific goes. Where you succeed, the Pacific succeeds.”
He said PNG’s strategic position, connecting the Pacific to Asia, puts the country at the heart of the Indo-Pacific, playing a critical role for trade routes, and presenting opportunities to renew and deepen ancient ties.
He also said that same geographic position also means that in times of turbulence, including both World Wars and at no small cost, Papua New Guinea has acted as a barrier between conflict in the world and the rest of the region.
“Your country is, as you have pointed out to me, Prime Minister, both a buffer and a bridge between Asia and the Pacific.
“It therefore almost goes without saying, Honourable Members, that Papua New Guinea matters to New Zealand. And the Government I lead is committed to strengthening our friendship and joint endeavours with you.”
“Papua New Guinea is an ambitious nation whose spirit rises with the mist over the Highlands, whose determination flows with the mighty Sepik and Fly rivers, and whose potential is as high as Mt Wilhelm.""
He described PNG as a nation rich not only in natural beauty and resources, but in the resilience, creativity, and spirit of the people."
Alcohol Industry Urged Support Responsible Drinking,05/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5530,"The alcohol industry, comprising manufacturers, distributors, and licensed vendors have been urged to support responsible drinking campaign, as this can help reduce the influx of alcohol-related deaths in the city.
Minister for Police, Peter Tsiamalili Jnr made this call following the death of up to 10 people in different parts of the country.
“Over the past weekend alone, between the 46th, 45th, and 44th days to Independence, 10 people tragically lost their lives in alcohol-related incidents, mostly from vehicle accidents.”
This sharp rise in avoidable deaths has triggered immediate response from the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
“To ensure public safety during the lead-up to Independence Day, the Government has authorised the activation of more than 700 police reserve personnel to reinforce law and order across Port Moresby, alongside intensified deployments of regular officers.”
“We cannot stand by as our roads become killing grounds. Our celebrations must not be marred by senseless loss of life. Ten lives lost in just three days is unacceptable,” Tsiamalili said.
Tsiamalili who is also the Acting Minister for Information Communications and Technology further called on alcohol manufacturers, distributors, and licensed vendors to be part of the solution in reducing violence and deaths.
“As Acting Communications Minister, I am directing greater engagement between the department with business and media outlets to work together to deal with this pressing issue.”
“It is wrong for businesses to profit from alcohol sales while turning a blind eye to the destruction their products cause.
“Those involved in the liquor business must step up and join us in promoting responsible drinking. Some of these businesses are already active in supporting awareness campaigns, and this is appreciated, but others have to step up.”
“We expect the alcohol industry to fund and support campaigns, display responsible drinking warnings on products and advertisements, and engage in real community awareness.”
He said the 50th Independence Anniversary should be a time of pride, unity, and reflection—not mourning and funerals.
“Let us celebrate Independence with dignity and responsibility. Let these next 44 days set a national example of unity, not tragedy.”"

Sonk maintains innocence,05/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5528,"Managing Director of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) Wapu Sonk has expressed concerns about the absence of a formal legal avenue for him to challenge the media allegations made against him.
Despite corruption allegations labelled against him by the Australian media, there are no formal complaints being laid with relevant government agencies like police to look into this matter.
“I have not been afforded a formal legal avenue to respond to or challenge the claims made against me. This absence of due process is deeply concerning.”
Labelling the allegations as a smear campaign by the Australian media, aimed at destroying his reputation at the Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited, he urged the public not to make judgement on hearsay.
“We must resist media sensationalism and remain steadfast in upholding due process, institutional respect, and national respect. The international and domestic communities alike must see that PNG is a nation governed by law – not by media narratives.”
In the meantime, Sonk said he is still the Managing Director of the KPHL and will carry out his entrusted role at the organization.
“I will continue my operational mandate to execute KPHL’s corporate strategy as approves by the Board and National Executive Council (NEC) through annual operating plans, unless this is changes through competent process.”
Sonk is actively carrying out its responsibility as the Managing Director of the Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited and is also working to clear his name from the allegations labeled against him.
Meantime, Sonk said he is ready to prove his innocence in court.
“To date, no concrete evidence has been produced nor any charges laid with respect to the claims,"" Sonk said.
""There are signed sub-contracts or officially sanctioned correspondence to support the allegations.”"
KPHL receives developer license for industrial park,05/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5526,"The Special Economic Zones Authority (SEZA) Board has approved the issuance of a 12-month Provisional Developer Licence to Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) for the development of the Central Province Industrial Park (CPIP) at Caution Bay.
This comes following recommendations from the SEZA Licensing Committee. The SEZA Board Chairman, Dr. Lawrence Sause, and the KPHL Managing Director, Wapu Sonk, announced in a joint press conference held in Port Moresby on Monday, August 4.
The CPIP project is a cornerstone of the government's economic diversification agenda and is expected to stimulate job creation, industrial processing, and regional development in Central Province.
The project will involve joinery and fabrication, as well as upgrading skill set and developing the competency of PNG in steelworks fabrication and joinery.
The Board, in the interest of financial prudence and legal compliance, resolved that the tax or non-tax incentives under the SEZ incentive framework are deferred pending the provision and assessment of the following by the SEZA Board.
The Board emphasized that incentives will not apply retrospectively. Only costs and activities undertaken after full compliance will be eligible for exemption or relief.
According to Dr Sause, the investment value of this project is K1.85 million.
This is a significant investment by one of PNG’s own companies, KPHL. This initiative, through this investment, demonstrates that KPHL genuinely believes in this country.
""We welcome this milestone for the Central Province Industrial Park and commend KPHL for taking the lead. At the same time, the Board has a legal duty to ensure transparency and fiscal discipline. We will only grant incentives when minimum financial disclosures and compliance standards are satisfied. This is how we build investor confidence and public trust,” he said.
Dr Sause said KPHL will be notified of the licence terms and has a 12-month window to comply. The Licensing Committee will reassess the application once all conditions are met, which may lead to conversion to a Full Developer Licence or activation of incentives under the current Provisional Licence. This approach supports investor engagement while maintaining the integrity of the SEZ program.
Mr Sonk said the first phase of the project will involve the establishment of the training and fabrication facility to train Papua New Guineans with the skills needed for the mining and oil and gas sector.
“The training and fabrication facility will be used to invest in PNG’s younger generation to build the skill base needed to fabricate things from not only PNG but overseas as well. It is not only a specialized project for resource projects such as oil, gas, and mining but also for general constructions and industry, such as building ships, boats, and many different things,” he said.
Sonk said other facilities that will be built include a police post, a clinic, and other government facilities that will benefit both the government and the community as well. However, KPHL will now work with the SEZA board to obtain the 15-year license for these developments."

Court dismisses review application on Dei by-election decision,05/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5521,"The Supreme Court on Thursday, July 31, dismissed the objection to the competency application filed by Westly Nukundj, which sought to review the National Court's decision ordering a by-election for the Dei Open electorate in 2024.
The application filed on February 11, 2025, challenged the election of the first respondent, late Steven Pim, who was elected as MP in the 2022 general election.
The applicant in these proceedings is Nukundj. The first respondent is late Pim, and the second respondent is the PNG Electoral Commission.
It was before the court that a trial was conducted. The trial judge, on July 22, 2023, reserved the decision. In September that same year, the first respondent died. The trial judge recalled the parties and received submissions on whether the National Court had jurisdiction to proceed to a decision on the petition. Finding that the National Court had jurisdiction, on February 23 2024, the trial judge delivered judgment and declared a by-election.
However, the applicant filed an objection to the competency application to review that decision because the National Court erred in part of the order. Nukundj claims that the court ought to have ordered a recount.
The applicant argues that the trial judge, after finding a serious error in the conduct of the election by the returning officer, unlawfully decided not to count the contents of two ballot boxes, and, finding that this error materially affected the result of the election, erred in not ordering a recount.
The second respondent, the Electoral Commission, submitted that the National Court has no jurisdiction due to the combined effects of section 104 (2) (g) and 106 of the Constitution. Section 104 (2) (g), states that the seat of a member of Parliament becomes vacant on his death. Section 106 states, if the office of an elected member of Parliament becomes vacant otherwise than by virtue of section 104 (2) (b) (normal term of office), an election shall be held to fill the vacancy unless the vacancy occurs;
(a) Within the period of 12 months before the fifth anniversary of the date fixed for the return of writs for the previous general election or,
(b) After the writ has been issued for an election under section 105 (1) (general elections) and before the day fixed for the return of that writ, writs for a general election are issued, the first-mentioned writ shall be deemed to have been revoked.
However, the Supreme Court, consisting of Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika, Justice David Cannings, Justice Collin Makail, and Justice Joseph Yagi, dismissed Nukundj’s review application because the Dei Open seat became vacant when the first respondent died on September 22, 2023. They stated that a by-election becomes necessary as a matter of law and that there are no exceptions to these constitutional requirements."

Oceanic Construction calls on politicians not to speculate,04/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5516,"Local construction company, Oceanic Construction Ltd has slammed calls made in Parliament last week regarding incomplete roadworks of the Mendi-Nipa road, which they are responsible for.
During Parliament session on Thursday, July 31 - Minister for Works and Highways, Solan Mirisim put local contractor, Oceanic Construction Ltd, on notice for failing to meet the expected outcomes. Minister Mirisim made the call after concerns were raised by Provincial Member for Southern Highlands William Powi in Parliament.
Oceanic Construction Ltd was engaged for rehabilitation of the Mendi to Nipa section of the road in Southern Highlands Province. Mirisim clarified that K119 million was paid to the contractor when the agreement was signed in 2021. He claimed that the contractor has completed only 36 percent of the road work.
In clarifying remarks made in Parliament, Oceanic Construction Ltd managing director and owner, Sape Molumi has called on Minister Mirisim to rectify his statement on the funds allocated for the road maintenance.
Molumi said the delayed roadwork was due to funding delay from the government.
Table showing expense of the funds
“I am a vulnerable local contractor who has no voice in Parliament and suffer the consequences. Following the question in Parliament, a meeting comprising of Minister Mirisim, Provincial Member Powi, Minister for Defence and Member for Nipa Kutubu, Dr Billy Joseph, Member for Mendi and Vice Minister for Public Enterprise, Raphael Tonpi and Secretary for Works and Highway was convened.
“I accepted the concern by the leaders and expressed my dissatisfaction that the information and response given by Minister was incorrect,” said Molumi.
He claimed that no K34 million payment as advance was received.
“The first payment for mobilization, survey design, establishment and preliminary works was K7,939,600.79 received on December 24, 2021 and second payment of K9,090,910.00 on April 27, 2022 and progressive payment follow till December22, 2024 totaling K74,494,915.80.
“For 2025 no payments received and our claim 17, 18, and 19 still outstanding and at the Department of Works for payment totaling over K8 million,” he stated.
Molumi said the project delay is a result of non-timely payment to support the contractor to progress the project. He said apart from funding delays, there were other site issues affecting the progress of the project.
“I request the Minister to rectify the misleading information. The project is ongoing and as soon as we receive payment for this year after seven months of waiting, we will resume work.
“We are a local construction company and committed to be partners in development regardless of hidden agendas,” Mr Molumi said."

While acknowledging the efforts of committed public servants, especially in remote areas, the Prime Minister stressed the urgency for performance-based reforms.
He said long-standing issues such as overdue retirements and unpaid superannuation are being addressed, with K211 million paid to retirees and over K200 million in outstanding superannuation contributions settled.

Kido village a new game changer to PNG,04/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5513,"The villagers of Kido village, Hiri Koiari District, will now see development in their area after a decade of dialogues involving developers, landowner groups, the government, and state agencies.
The Pacific Lime and Cement project was launched on Friday, August 1, at Kido village by Prime Minister James Marape.
This launch, known as the country’s first downstream lime-manufacturing hub, is capable of producing quicklime, clinker, and ultimately cement from quarry to port. This could potentially establish a new export industry as well.
Kido Landowner Association Chairman said, “For us, the landowners, it represents opportunity, partnership and the beginning of lasting change for our community.

“This is 400million tonnes plus of materials that are here to build the country, to prioritize building the country first before we export abroad.
“I’m so privileged that we will see bricks, pavers, casting, bridge pipes, beams, everything that could be made in here for the future of the country.”
This launch is known as the country’s first downstream lime-manufacturing hub, capable of producing quicklime, clinker, and ultimately cement from quarry to port. This could potentially establish a new export industry as well.
Prime Minister Marape stated, “When not many people had faith in this place, you (PCL) walked this place, looked at the village and felt it was worth investing when many overlooked it. Whilst others have gone around looking for other minerals like gold and copper, you’ve picked up something that is closest to my heart, and that is lime to replace the import of cement.

Officials trained ahead of counting,04/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5512,"The Usino-Bundi by-election officials have undergone a one-day training facilitated by the Provincial Electoral Office ahead of counting this week.
The training is a refresher to ensure they are well informed to monitor counting officials during the actual counting scheduled to commence on Tuesday, 05th August.
The officials comprise the Returning Officer Terence Baiyo and the Assistant Returning Officers (AROs) of each Local Level Government.
Trainer Richard Kaiban, the Assistant Election Manager for East Sepik, emphasized the new approach of the count model of decentralized counting at a centralized count centre that they will be taking to ensure counting is effectively and efficiently coordinated for an improved outcome.
The training took the participants through the LPV voting system and the technical details of the counting processes, such as the:
•	Exclusion/Elimination
•	Formal and Informal ballot paper identifications
•	Exhausted ballot papers
•	Calculating the absolute majority
•	Allowed personnel within the counting venue
•	Quality checks and procedures
•	Appropriate forms utilized for counting and Quality checks
•	Filling forms correctly
Provincial Election Manager, Szponsa Navi said it is vital for the AROs to attend this training so as to gain the knowledge needed to train count officials for the LLG elections coming in September.
The nine participants were also given examples of counting scenarios and put into perspective situations that may arise as counting progresses. Scenarios that included Crisis Management protocols and the chain of command and channel of communication needed to follow if an error is encountered.
The Returning Officer for the Usino-Bundi by-election, Terence Baiyo, emphasized due diligence for the counting so that the Usino-Bundi people genuinely accept their newly appointed leader for the next several months until the next National General Elections in 2027.
In conclusion, Mr Kaiban reiterated the importance of counting and the documentation for an acceptable count and declaration in line with the Organic Law on National & LLG Election.
The new counting strategy is said to be cost-effective by limiting counting days from almost two weeks to a week or even a few days. The counting process will begin with separate LLG counts, quality checks, and later merging of data for elimination, and eventually a declaration."
ABG embraces forestry autonomy,04/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5511,"The Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) is now prepared to make greater progress in forestry management and economic empowerment for its people, after signing a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with the PNG Forest Authority (PNGFA).
The signing took place in Port Moresby between PNGFA Managing Director John Mosoro and ABG Chief Secretary Kearnneth Nanei and was witnessed by senior officials from both parties on Friday, August 1, 2025.
Speaking after the signing, PNGFA Managing Director John Mosoro said the agreement in principle allows for a ""structured and meaningful step forward toward empowering Bougainville to sustainably manage its forest resources.
“Today's signing of the Memorandum of Agreement between PNGFA and ABG represents a significant step forward in supporting Bougainville's autonomy aspirations. It outlines a structured and practical approach to transferring selected forestry powers and responsibilities, under the Forestry Act 1991 (as amended), to the ABG from 2025 to 2030.
He said this initiative reflected a broader trend across government, where national departments and agencies have entered similar agreements with the ABG to gradually transfer functions.
“These partnerships have provided useful lessons and a national pathway to manage transition responsibly while maintaining national and sectoral integrity,” he said.
Mr Mosoro added that the MOA preserves national oversight while honouring Bougainville's autonomy.
“It sets up a formal platform for structured cooperation, enabling PNGFA to continue offering technical assistance, policy advice, and institutional support as Bougainville builds its internal capacity,” he explained.
The Chief Secretary of the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG), Kearneth Nanei, described the signing as “historic and significant,” marking a formal commitment to the transfer of key powers and functions to Bougainville under the ongoing autonomy arrangements.
Mr Nanei commended Mr Mosoro and his executive team for their leadership and support in progressing the transfer of forestry-related responsibilities to the region.
“We thank you for making your time available to meet with us,” Nanei said.
“On behalf of the President, the Autonomous Bougainville Government, and the people of Bougainville, we are grateful for this momentous occasion.”
The meeting marked a pivotal moment in the broader transfer of powers under the constitutional framework of Papua New Guinea, specifically the implementation of Schedules 1 and 2 of the Memorandum of Understanding between the national government and the ABG.
Nanei emphasized technical capacity, institutional arrangements, structured cooperation, and ongoing collaboration as the foundation of the successful implementation of Bougainville’s forestry powers.
“This partnership represents the first time a national agency has agreed to relinquish some of its powers to a sub-national government. It is not just symbolic—it empowers Bougainville to sustainably manage its forestry resources,” he said.
Reflecting on Bougainville’s past, Nanei noted hard-learned lessons from past resource extraction ventures and called for a more responsible and inclusive model of development going forward.
“We had a very bad experience in terms of resource development, and in terms of mining, in terms of the forestry sector, the experience that we've gone through has taught us a lot in terms of how resources are extracted and benefits are received,” he explained.
“The experience that we have gone through has taught the national government and the independent state of Papua New Guinea, and the rest of us lessons that we have to be delicate in dealing with resource owners, land owners, and other people in the community.
“So, with those lessons learned, we take this transfer of forestry powers and functions that's very significant and historic. So, this is a historic occasion, and we are privileged and honoured to be with you and your very senior management team witnessing this occasion.”
He reaffirmed ABG’s commitment to agreeing and called on the PNGFA to help Bougainville develop the necessary human resources and institutional frameworks to manage its forestry sector.
“This joint partnership, cooperation that we are building together, will be the part in terms of empowering Bougainvilleans, the ABG, to build up their capacity in terms of manpower, but also the regulatory institution that is going to be required to effectively manage and administer the forestry powers and functions in the autonomous region of Bougainville,” added Mr Nanei.”"
PNG welcomes NZ Prime Minister,03/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5507,"New Zealand Prime Minister, Christopher Luxon, makes a landmark visit to Papua New Guinea on Monday, August 4, ahead of the nation's 50th Independence celebrations.
Prime Minister James Marape has confirmed that PM Luxon will arrive tomorrow for a three-day State Visit – from Monday, 4th to Wednesday, August 6. This visit heralds a major season of diplomatic engagement as Papua New Guinea gears up to commemorate its 50th Independence Anniversary.
Prime Minister Marape hailed the visit as a defining moment in bilateral relations, underscoring New Zealand’s long-standing support for Papua New Guinea’s development, security, and regional stability.
“New Zealand has stood with Papua New Guinea since we gained independence,” Prime Minister Marape said. “From education and climate resilience to trade and governance, their steadfast support has been foundational.”
Upon arrival, PM Luxon is expected to attend High-Level Ceremonies & Parliamentary Address, which includes a State Dinner.
On Tuesday, August 5 (morning), PM Luxon will address the National Parliament of PNG, followed by bilateral discussions on trade, climate resilience, labour mobility, and infrastructure development. On Wednesday, after a farewell ceremony, PM Luxon departs Port Moresby.
“This visit is more than ceremonial—it will fortify people-to-people links, government partnerships, and economic collaboration,” Prime Minister Marape said.
New Zealand plays a vital role in Bougainville’s Peace Process and remains deeply engaged in post-referendum consultations with the Autonomous Bougainville Government and the Government of Papua New Guinea. The Burnham Consultations, hosted at Burnham Military Camp in Canterbury in June 2025, were led by independent moderator Sir Jerry Mateparae and supported by the United Nations.
As a signatory witness to the Bougainville Peace Agreement, New Zealand played a pivotal role in the historic peace process: hosting the 1997 Burnham talks, facilitating a neutral venue for dialogue, and deploying an unarmed Truce Monitoring Group to ensure security during ceasefire negotiations.
In June 2025, both governments agreed during the Burnham Consultations to table the 2019 referendum results, along with a moderator’s report and bipartisan committee findings, before the PNG National Parliament, advancing the region’s political future.
Prime Minister Marape acknowledges New Zealand’s continued support.
“New Zealand’s role as a neutral facilitator and peace partner remains indispensable. Their commitment at Burnham reaffirms our shared dedication to a lasting, homegrown solution for Bougainville’s future.”
PM Luxon’s visit opens a historic season of diplomacy for PNG’s golden jubilee."
CLRC conducts review of colonial laws,03/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5505,"The Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) recently conducted a two-day workshop under its Colonial Law Review Program (CLRP), focusing on the review of the Mercantile Act 1953 and the Public Trustee Act 1951.
The CLRP is integral to the CLRC's mandate, aiming to assess pre-independence laws and evaluate their alignment with Papua New Guinea's contemporary legal and developmental needs.
Both the Mercantile Act 1953 and the Public Trustee Act 1951 were incorporated into the PNG Constitution at independence in 1975, reflecting their colonial origins and the interests they served during that era.
The workshop facilitated in-depth discussions on these statutes, identifying areas for potential reform. Stakeholders, including Bank South Pacific (Legal Unit), the Office of the Public Trustee, the Department of Lands and Physical Planning, and the Department of the Prime Minister and National Executive Council (Legal Unit), provided valuable insights.
Key focus areas included policy frameworks, functional clarity, and the resolution of ambiguities, in relation to key terms used throughout the legislation.
The Mercantile Act 1953 addresses aspects of commercial law, including debt assignments, powers of attorney, and voidable transfers, with the intent to prevent fraud in business transactions. The Public Trustee Act 1951 governs the administration of deceased estates, trusts, and insolvencies, designating the Public Trustee as the statutory trustee.
CLRC Secretary Dr. Mange Matui emphasized the importance of a comprehensive approach to legal reform, stating, ""We are providing this platform for discussion; as an independent law reform agency, we can assist in this space.""
""Reforms must be holistic, considering related laws to ensure our recommendations do not conflict with other existing legislations,” he said.
The feedback gathered will inform the development of a Position Paper, which will be submitted to relevant agencies with recommendations for legislative reform.
The workshop was led by CLRC Deputy Secretary for Legislative Services, Dorothy Mimiko-Kesenga, and CLRC Principal Legal Officer for Colonial Law, Sandon Kikala."
Counting remains in Usino-Bundi,03/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5503,"Counting and declaration of the Usino-Bundi by-election will be held in the district despite the provincial police’s requests to relocate the counting venue to Madang town.
Election Manager Sponsa Navi and the Returning Officer for the Usino-Bundi by-election have maintained that counting and the declaration will remain within the district.
This comes after the Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim, requested last week that the provincial electoral move counting to Madang district due to security issues and recent incidents.
Mr Navi said it would be costly to relocate to Madang and may cause logistical constraints where an additional K1.2M will have to be sourced for the costs involved. He added that the majority of candidates want the count to be hosted within the district as a neutral ground.
“It is the people’s right to see how their vote will elect a new leader, and to observe the processes involved in electing a new MP. I believe manpower is sufficient, and we have taken steps to ensure electricity will not be an issue at night. We have secured a new standby generator for flood lights from the district office,” Mr Navi stated.
Concerning the boxes with issues:
1.	Hijacked box from Bundi LLG – is a disputed box and will not be counted.
2.	300 missing ballot papers from Kesowai (Usino LLG) – box will be counted
Currently, these issues have been raised and will be clarified in a meeting with the election manager today.
Counting is scheduled to commence on Tuesday, August 5, at the Sports Complex in Usino-Bundi. The electoral office said if all goes well, counting is expected to conclude on Sunday, August 10. This will enable ample time for the return of writs on the 22nd August."

Strengthen public health through points of entry,03/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5499,"The International Organization for Migration (IOM), in partnership with the Government of Japan and the Pacific Immigration Development Community (PIDC), concluded a series of training aimed at strengthening public health management capacities at points of entry (PoEs) across Papua New Guinea.
The training sessions were delivered under the framework of the Infectious Diseases Border Governance (IBG) Project, officially titled “Strengthening the Capacity of Border Control for Responding to Infectious Diseases in Pacific Island Countries.”
Launched in 2022, the IBG Project supports the socio-economic recovery of the Pacific region by enabling the safe and efficient resumption of border operations through enhanced preparedness and response to infectious diseases.
In this context, IOM conducted a nationwide training on “Public Health Management at Points of Entry” targeting border officials from ports, airports, and ground crossings.
Between 7 June and 18 July 2025, seven two-day training sessions were organized in Lae, Port Moresby, Daru, Vanimo, Kieta, Rabaul, and Madang. A total of 84 border officials participated in the training, representing key institutions including the Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority, National Department of Health, PNG Customs Service, National Agriculture Quarantine and Inspection Authority, PNG Ports Corporation Limited, National Airports Corporation, and the Papua New Guinea Defence Force.
The sessions, facilitated by Dr. Yahya Alamese, covered essential topics such as the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), IOM’s Health, Border and Mobility Management framework, infection prevention and control (IPC), case management, and the development of public health emergency plans.
The training utilized methods such as group work, practical exercises, video presentations, and technical discussions to encourage hands-on learning and engagement.
Participants provided highly positive feedback, noting increased awareness, knowledge, and confidence in applying public health protocols at points of entry. Many expressed interests in more frequent and practical training, emphasizing the need for standard operating procedures, improved inter-agency communication, and the availability of personal protective equipment.
The sessions also fostered stronger coordination among national institutions, which is essential for effective cross-border health security.
Dr. Alamese commended the active participation of trainees and acknowledged the valuable insights they contributed throughout the sessions. He noted a significant improvement in participants’ understanding of public health requirements at PoEs, and encouraged the adoption of a “train-the-trainer” model to sustain capacity-building efforts over the long term.
This training is an essential step toward enhancing Papua New Guinea’s implementation of the International Health Regulations and boosting the country’s preparedness and response capacity at border points.
It reinforces IOM’s commitment to supporting national authorities in safeguarding public health and ensuring the resilience of border operations in the face of health emergencies."

SARV on the rise in Madang,01/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5490,"Madang Province has faced a significant increase in violence related to sorcery accusations. According to Melanesian Institute research, this alarming trend mainly impacts vulnerable groups, especially women and girls, and the elderly. The Melanesian Institute told this newsroom that the need for information and education in SARV was critical. It successfully delivered the awareness with the support of the Madang Catholic archdiocese and local stakeholders.
Their awareness covered information on what SARV means and how it affects the community; legal means of dealing with sorcery-related issues and the legal consequences of SARV. The program served a critical remainder to youths on how to address issues without cultural and traditional bias.
The awareness program was also conducted in schools across Sumkar, Bogia, and Madang districts. The program was designed for the younger generation so they can engage in discussions and understand SARV.
The Melanesian Institute reported that significant challenges still remain. The province's rugged terrain and a deeply ingrained culture of silence surrounding sorcery-related violence complicate progress.
They also note that many village court officials lack understanding of laws on SARV and how to deal with SARV cases and this hinders the effective enforcement of national laws, which in turn, does little to prevent the rise of sorcery related violence.
At the conclusion of the awareness program, community leaders requested for more of this initiative to help crackdown SARV. They also requested for comprehensive training for village court officers and community police units."

Kokoda Funding Commitment Questioned in Parliament,01/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5487,"The Sohe MP has asked the Prime Minister to confirm whether a decade-long financial commitment to Kokoda Track communities has been honoured—while urging key leaders including the Minister for Tourism, Arts and Culture, to take note.
Amuli directed his question to Prime Minister James Marape, referencing NEC Decision No. 6 of 2015, which directed K10 million to be allocated each year for ten years to benefit communities along the Kokoda Track. He asked whether the funds had been released and which programs they supported.
“The people of Kokoda region laik save sapos displa K10m we NEC decision em i stap long en, displa K10m ol i rilisim pinis o nogat... and if the government released that money, em rilisim go long wanem ol programs?” Amuli said. (The people in the Kokoda region would like to know if the K10 million committed through an NEC decision, has been released and which programs the funding will support.)
The Kokoda Track, spanning 96 kilometres from Northern province to Central province, runs through 14 council wards—six in Hiri-Koiari LLG and eight in Kokoda LLG. The funding commitment falls under the Joint Understandings 1, 2, and 3 signed between the PNG and Australian governments.
The original Joint Understanding emerged from a high-level PNG-Australia ministerial meeting in Madang in 2008, aimed at preserving the Brown River Catchment, Owen Stanley Ranges, and Kokoda Track region. The three central pillars of this policy are:
1.	Protection of the Kokoda Track,
2.	Sustainable development of communities and environment along the track, and
3.	Conservation of natural and cultural heritage.
This initiative was further strengthened by a second Joint Declaration signed by Prime Ministers Peter O’Neill and Tony Abbott on 10 September 2015, which reaffirmed support for sustainable development and cooperation along the Kokoda corridor.
In response, Prime Minister Marape assured the House that the government would investigate and ensure outstanding commitments are fulfilled.
“I want to give him assurance... to get relevant departments to do assessment on how much has been paid already... and if there is any outstanding then we will enter into a program to make sure that these commitments are caught up at the very earliest,” Marape stated.
The Kokoda Initiative remains the main vehicle for delivering programs under the joint understandings, supporting heritage conservation, community livelihood projects, environmental protection, and tourism.
As the final year of the ten-year funding cycle concludes in 2024, communities along the Kokoda Track await full transparency and accountability."

""Minister, what specific actions are you taking to address the drastic decline in efficiency at the RTA, where services that once took less than an hour under MVIL now consume an entire day for our citizens?"" Juffa asked.
""Minister, is your Ministry aware of the widespread public complaints regarding the poor customer service and apathy from RTA staff, and what immediate measures will be implemented to ensure our people are treated with respect and professionalism?

He said, ""Minister, can you justify the mandate and operational guidelines for the frequent RTA roadblocks, which many citizens perceive as targeted harassment rather than genuine road safety enforcement?
""Minister, given the demonstrable failure of the RTA to deliver these essential services effectively, will your ministry commit to a review with the view to return these functions to the proven and efficient administration of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Limited (MVIL)?""
Prime Minister James Marape confirmed in his response that he will be meeting with authorities concerned and deliberate on the issues raised.
He also confirmed vehicle registration functions will be given back MVIL.

Providing healthcare in remote regions,01/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5478,"The Sexual and Reproductive Health Integration Project (SHRIP), supported by the Australian Government, enhances access to quality sexual and reproductive health services in Papua New Guinea.
Present across 11 provinces, the project supports 13 Catholic Church Health Services (CCHS) health facilities to provide community-based counselling, testing, and treatment for people living with HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
The project also aims to strengthen systems, service delivery, partnerships, and community engagement. In PNG, church-run health facilities play a significant role in the delivery of healthcare for many people in rural areas.
One such facility is the Mary Mother of Catholic Hope under the CCHS in Buka, Autonomous Region of Bougainville. The clinic is not just a place for treatment but a place of hope.
""We see mothers, children, and entire families come through our doors, often coming from afar. They come because they trust us, and we are here to serve them with dignity and care,” says Sister in Charge Mama Rose.
The clinic serves as a hub for integrating HIV and STI testing and treatment, as well as antenatal care, making it an essential part of the community's health infrastructure.
As part of their services, Mama Rose and her team conduct awareness and outreach activities to educate their communities on the importance of prevention and treatment.
Mama Rose says, ''These services are crucial in ensuring that our people, especially women and young people, receive the care they need, when they need it.''
Their work is not done in isolation. They work alongside various partners, such as the Bougainville Department of Health and the National Department of Health. Through their support, they enable them to reach the most remote communities through their diocese's satellite clinics, extending the hands of the government.
Thanks to the dedication of Catholic Church Health Services and the relentless efforts of frontline workers like Mama Rose, the Mary Mother of Hope Clinic is a shining example of how faith-based organisations are crucial in providing essential healthcare in remote regions.
SRHIP is a consortium including the Australasian Society for HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexual Health Medicine (ASHM), Burnet Institute, Igat Hope with the CCHS, leading the implementation. This project is supported through the PNGAus Partnership."

Media restrain from reporting ICAC’s investigations,31/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5475,"The Waigani National Court has restrained Papua New Guinea media from reporting any investigation or confidential matter conducted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption, effective today.
Presiding Judge Justice Pauline Bre made this declaration, following constant orders from the state and ICAC legal representatives, asking the court to ban the media from reporting investigations conducted by ICAC.
The orders seek to stop the media from reporting on confidential investigations, but it does not stop the media from reporting on matters that are before the court.
Meanwhile, there were two separate ICAC cases before the court. One is a matter of suspended Commissioner Andrew Forbes, who is seeking the court's intervention to reinstate him as the appointed ICAC Commissioner, and restraining other suspended Commissioners, Daniel Baulch and Graham Gill, from investigating him.
The matter was set to be heard today for a pre-trial conference, but neither party was ready to proceed with the matter.
While in a separate matter, Baulch and Gill are challenging their suspension, claiming that it was unconstitutional and invalid.
Their lawyer Iuile Dulcy Haladei filed their case on July 2 2025 against the chairman and members of the appointing committee of ICAC.They are Prime Minister James Marape as chairman, members are Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika, Chairman o the PNG Council of Churches Cardinal Sir John Ribat, Opposition Leader Douglas Tomuriesa and Chairman of the Public Services Commission Apeo Fuata Sione.
Early this month, Thomas Eluh was appointed as ICAC Commissioner, replacing suspended commissioner Andrew Forbes.
On July 8, Eluh was sworn in with two new deputy commissioners, Justice Ellenas Batari and retired Judge Don Sawong.
On July 4 2023, Forbes, Baulch and Gill were sworn in as commissioners and deputies for three years. In August and September last year, Forbes reported an allegation of corrupt conduct against Baulch and Gill to the appointments committee. But Forbes did not take any steps to investigate, or cause to be investigated, the allegations made by him.
On August 6 2024, Bauclch and Gill reported allegations of corrupt conduct against Forbes to the appointments committee.

Polling officials locked up over misplaced ballots,31/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5473,"In a separate incident in the Usino-Bundi by-election, Presiding Officer Mark Dekene and Team 2 polling officials, who had been carrying out polling at Sankian, Dumpu, and Kesowai, have been detained at the Ramu police station after ballot papers fell short.
Team 2 was responsible for Usino LLGs - Ward 6 Sankian, Ward 7 Dumpu and Ward 8 Kesowai, as of Friday last week. The ballot box for these three wards were locked away during the weekend.

Be proactive in customary land deals: Parkop,31/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5468,"Members of parliament today raised debated the amendment to Land Act 1996 which was introduced by the Minister for Lands, Planning and Urbanization and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso. The Amendment would apply to Customary Land use especially for commercial purposes.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop affirmed a proposal by Member for Hiri-Koiari about a penalty clause to be included in the Act.  The penalty would apply to the person who sells the customary land as well as the one who knowingly purchased the land.
Thus Mr. Parkop suggested that the government must be proactive.
“Our people want to assist the government, support development but we are not proactive, so they decide to sell their land, because they have no other ways of income,” Parkop said.
“The other thing too Mr. Speaker I want to mention is that even though this Land Act only covers three per cent of the land in PNG and we talk about the customary land but the fact of the matter is that we are accessing customary land through other Acts - Mining Act, Forestry Act, the Agriculture Act,” he added.
He added that customary land ownership is not an impediment to development and it shows that if investors negotiate with landowners they will cooperate with the government and developers but they must be given all the pros and cons of development in order to make a conscience decision.
Parkop said the government should not be in a rush to covert customary land into state land or into lease, but emphasized ongoing discussion with the landowner."

12th PNGFA Flower Show,30/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5450,"The PNG Floriculture Association Inc proudly launched its 12th Annual Flower Show at the PNG National Museum, Waigani, celebrating the theme: “Where Flowers Tell a Story.” The show runs daily until Sunday August 3. It is open to the public between 8:30am to 5pm. They can experience the various displays of artistic, agricultural, and cultural power of flowers.
Association president Lynn Lantaca, says this year’s theme was chosen because it is significant to their journey as an association since 2009.
Lantaca said over 17 years many members and non-members from different provinces have built decent livelihoods from their flower businesses. This year, the Flower Show is an opportunity for them to share their successes.
“Before, there was not enough demand for cut flowers, but now cut flower demand is high in the city,” she said. “Also, what we expect to get from the flower orders compared to before has changed.”
Quality, quantity and price has changed significantly over the years also.
“A bundle of five to six cut heliconia stems used to be K2,” she said. “Now (it) has changed to two to three cut stems for K2.”
Lancata says the organisation recommends farmers to plant just one type of flower so that they can maintain it well and continuously supply their customer.
On the first day of the Flower Show, judges moved around each of the 15 stalls to observe how green leaves arrangements are presented and arched in front of the stalls' entrance. This year’s arch competition will evolve into more creative stall setups. The criteria is on foliage judging, with focus on green leaves only. They are also looking at arrangements for table posy, extension and A-Line cascading styles. Flower arrangements are not being judged this year"

The prime minister confirmed this in his response to Provincial Member for gulf Chris Haiveta.
Marape’s confirmation of an independent investigation into KPHL is a significant move towards enhancing transparency and accountability within the state-owned enterprise, especially given its critical role in managing Papua New Guinea’s oil and gas resources.
This investigation can help address concerns regarding financial management, governance, and any potential irregularities that may have been raised by stakeholders. The Prime Minister revealed this in his response to relating questions by Provincial Member for Gulf Sir Chris Haiveta.
“I have written to the International Media to tell us where they get their reports from to ascertain their findings,” Marape said. “We will support the investigation and will table a detailed report on the floor of Parliament after the findings.”
The Prime Minister gave assurance that such inquiries are essential not only for maintaining public trust but also for ensuring that the benefits from natural resource extraction are appropriately managed and distributed, particularly in a resource-rich country like Papua New Guinea.
He further stressed that an independent investigation can also help to provide a clearer picture of KPHL’s operations and its impact on the national economy.
The decision comes at a time when public scrutiny of state entities is heightened, and could lead to reform measures that enhance operational efficiencies and align KPHL’s activities with national development goals.

Porgera CDA nears completion,29/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5437,"Minister for Mining Rainbo Paita has confirmed that the process of the Community Development Agreement for the Porgera Mining project is nearing completion. He was asked to give an update by Provincial Member Sir Peter Ipatas in parliament early this afternoon.
The progress on the CDA is an important development process for stakeholders involved, especially the local communities in Enga Province. The CDA outlines commitments and benefits that the mining company will provide to impact communities, including infrastructure development, health services, education, and other vital services.
“We are into the final stages of the CDA process and will be consulting with leaders of the impacted communities,” Paita said.
Sir Peter Ipatas’s inquiry highlights ongoing concerns about community engagement and the distribution of benefits from mining operations, which are often crucial for local development.
The completion of the CDA may pave the way for improved relations between the mining company, the government, and the local impact communities, ensuring that local voices are considered in the mining project process. The progress on the CDA is particularly significant given the historical context of the Porgera Mine, which has faced various challenges, including legal disputes and issues surrounding environmental and social impacts.

Clamp down on illegal mining activities,29/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5436,"PNG’s small-scale mining sector has largely been unregulated until recently.
In a first for the country, 11 Chinese nationals are being prosecuted under section 167 of the Mining Act 1992.
These foreign workers were apprehended in Wau, Morobe Province, for unauthorised alluvial mining using machinery.
The small-scale mining manager from the Mineral Resources Authority, Andrew Onguglo, assured attendees during today’s CANCONEX session at APEC Haus that enforcement is currently underway.
“The mining act, actually, now has teeth to bite,” Onguglo said in this morning’s session 5B on ‘small scale mining’.
“Before, we had a lot of non-compliance, illegal works. Now, any breach is directly a police matter.
“They will be arrested, equipment confiscated, they will be charged, they will go for court.”
He drew attention to the stop work order that was published by the regulator, Mineral Resources Authority, on June 4, 2025.
The public notice was to “all persons and companies carrying out unauthorised alluvial mining operations within alluvial mining districts, and in other areas in Papua New Guinea”.
Onguglo presented that the MRA has, so far, received reports of 66 unauthorised alluvial mining operations using heavy machinery.
“The notice itself is very serious,” he continued.
“One strike and you are gone.
“The international developers that come in; once you are arrested, you have breached your work permit and visa condition. So, you can be deported easily.
“That notice has been put forward to protect this sector because there are claims that this sector has been doing well but we are not seeing the revenue going up, the production going up.
“Where are the gold going?
“So, these are some attempts to put in place some controls in any dealings involving this sector.”"
An honest 50-year review presented to PM,29/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5433,"An honest and independent assessment review of the country’s progress since 1975, initiated by the National Executive Council, was presented to the National Government on Monday, July 28.
Prime Minister James Marape stated that the preliminary report, presented by the 50-Year National Review Committee, chaired by former deputy prime minister Charles Abel and deputised by Arthur Somare.
The report is not about apportioning blame or celebrating blindly; however, it is critically analysing how far PNG has come in 50 years, through identifying weaknesses, recognising strengths, and setting out what must be done to move forward with clarity and purpose.
According to a statement, data and statistics were sourced from credible institutions, including the National Research Institute (NRI), which recently completed its comprehensive PNG 1975–2025 Review, along with inputs from the Consultative Implementation and Monitoring Council (CIMC), UNDP, the Australian National University (ANU), and other local and international agencies.
“From 1975 to 2008, our economy grew below 1 percent annually while the population expanded by over 3 percent. This mismatch has contributed to the structural difficulties we face today, with half of our population under the age of 25. It is a wake-up call.”
The report recommends priority areas for reform, including: Accelerating economic diversification; Improving government efficiency and accountability; Tackling corruption and lawlessness; Investing in human capital and youth opportunities.
Furthermore, PM Marape confirmed that the review is being conducted at arm’s length from political interference, with the committee granted full independence to assess even the performance of his government over the past six years.

Power outage affects flights,29/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5427,"A major power outage occurred at NiuSky head office in Port Moresby on Monday, July 28, that shut down air traffic services for a short period.
The failure was caused by a malfunction in the backup power system (UPS), which keeps essential systems running when the main power goes out.
Unfortunately, this breakdown left air traffic controllers without access to radar, radios, weather updates, or communication lines.
Minister for Civil Aviation Wakw Goi confirmed that as a result, all domestic flights were halted from major airports, and three incoming domestic flights had to be guided in manually using emergency radios.
For international flights flying over PNG, nearby centres in Brisbane (Australia) and Oakland (Los Angeles, USA) were informed, and pilots were told to follow a safety procedure known as TIBA (Traffic Information Broadcast by Aircraft).
However, he said services were fully restored within about 80 minutes, and no accidents or safety incidents occurred.
But, a key aviation notice – Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) could not be sent until later in the day due to system outages, which may raise regulatory concerns.
A preliminary investigation found that the UPS failure was worsened by a failure in the airfield lighting panel.
While the incident was handled professionally, it highlighted risks to the operational systems that need urgent fixing to ensure safety and reliability in the future.
“I have asked our MD for full transparency and quick corrective actions and for a formal investigation to be done and a report to be provided within two weeks,” said Minister Goi."

Police apprehend SARV suspects in Central Province,29/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5417,"Bad road conditions at Bam village in Cloudy Bay LLG, Central Province, did not stop four police vehicles on an operation to apprehend a group of suspects involved in a Sorcery Accusation-Related Violence (SARV) case at Ganai village in Abau District.
The roads from Moreguina, Lalaura, Ganai, and other villages are in a bad state, which has caused them to miss out on most government services, including the lack of police presence.
The Ganai villagers were surprised to see four police vehicles from Port Moresby in the village on Saturday night (July 26) to apprehend suspects involved in a SARV and arson case that occurred two years ago.
The Commander of NCD/Central, Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi, confirmed that there was a report of a SARV case from two years ago that led to a man losing his life and several houses being burnt to ashes.
He said several reports were filed at the local police station in Moreguina, and a copy was forwarded to him after the man who was accused died recently.
Commander Turi said that when the report reached his office, he sought support from the Mobile Squad and the Central Provincial Police Commander, who planned the operation and successfully led to the apprehension of seven suspects.
""I had confirmed that six males and one female are now in police custody to be charged. The suspects are those who were involved in harbouring the main suspects of the SARV case and those who were involved in seriously assaulting a man who died last month at Port Moresby General Hospital. The other suspect was also arrested for burning the SARV suspect's house.
“We are here to help the people of our command, and we will try our best to help solve their issues. We were also told that they were happy to see police in the village to deal with the case that had separated families for some years,"" Turi said.
He added that police will act when information provided to them is accurate. Turi said it is also costly to plan and execute a police operation when information is sketchy and parties involved are not cooperating with the police when asked to come forward.
Commander Turi is pleased with how those suspects behaved when apprehended at Ganai village. The suspects cooperated with the police, who got into the police vehicle and traveled another nine hours back to Port Moresby.
""I was pleased to hear that they assisted the police officers when the police vehicles got bogged down while they were returning to Port Moresby. They also told police officers that most of the government services,  cannot reach them because of the bad road conditions.”
“I am pleased with the police units who executed the operation successfully. It is now a message to others that the police will still come for you if you commit an offense. All we need is detailed information from victims so the police can plan and execute without doubt. This one was a good operation, and I thank the people who lodged the complaint,"" Turi said.
The suspects are detained at Sogeri Police Station, and a CID officer from Central is taking charge of the case.
Commander Turi challenged leaders in his command to work with the police so they can serve the people who need police services."

Locals in Middle Ramu witnessed the machinery being moved across early this month.
It’s a welcome sight and sigh of relief as locals put their hopes in this infrastructure development project that means access to more government services.

It has contributed largely to the stagnant socio-economic status in the district and people are not progressing at all.
Mr Kamdaru said with the road links, locals including small scale farmers can access services including markets to improve their standard of living."
Candidate angry over election mishaps,28/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5406,"Former Madang governor and candidate contesting the Usino-Bundi by-election, Jim Kas expressed frustration towards candidates who are disturbing the flow of the polling.
He called on candidates to remain calm and let the polling process take its course. He warned other candidates intending to disturb the polling this week to bear in mind that their integrity and reputation are at stake.
“You will disqualify yourself and be a disgrace to your voters and people,” he added.
Kas stated that the by-election is just as real as the upcoming 2027 National General Elections, setting aside rumors suggesting that the by-election is merely a short-term “acting” post for any candidate who wins.
On the other hand, Kas commended security personnel and election coordinators on the ground for being on top of the unraveling situations that occurred during last week’s polling.
“The Electoral Commission and the police deserve credit for continuously being on top of the disturbing events, showcasing transparency and credibility,” Kas stated.
Meanwhile, he recommended that the Electoral Commission increase nomination fees for National General Election candidates, which could potentially deter ill-intentioned candidates.
“PNGEC must seriously consider increasing nomination fees to K10,000 or K20,000. This is the right time to do it as this can deter small-minded candidates from contesting and tarnishing the flow of elections,” Kas said.
He is urging the candidates to remain objective and let the elections continue until the declaration is made."

PNG observes Judiciary Well-being Day,27/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5400,"PNG Judiciary Well-being Day was observed last week at the Waigani Court yard, in collaboration with Pacific International Hospital to promote mental, physical, and emotional well-being within the justice sector.
Judicial officers worldwide mark this day as the first International Day for Judicial Well-being, following its formal adoption by the United Nations General Assembly earlier this year.
The observance stems from the Nauru Declaration of July 2024, which called for urgent attention to the mental, emotional, and physical health of those serving in judicial roles.
In Papua New Guinea, the day was commemorated on Friday, 25th, with a keynote speech by Dr. Ludwig Nanawar, a Senior consultant and visiting psychiatrist of the Laloki Psychiatric Hospital.
He said the International Day of Judicial Well-Being emphasises the importance of the judiciary’s efforts under challenging circumstances, such as the impact of workload, political influence, and extreme circumstances weighing on the physical and mental health of judicial staff.
He defined health as a state of physical, mental, and social well-being, not the absence of disease.
“Mental issues like depression and anxiety often present with physical symptoms, causing a financial burden of mental health conditions and explaining how people with mental health issues often undergo unnecessary tests and spend significant amounts on treatments,” said Dr Nanawar.
He emphasised that the topic of work-life balance must be introduced, with a focus on its role in reducing stress and burnout.
Dr Nanawar said setting boundaries, such as not checking emails after work hours and prioritising tasks and setting boundaries, is good.
“Prioritising tasks and setting boundaries to manage work responsibilities and personal life effectively can help immensely,” he said. Dr Naranwar said delegating tasks reduces stress and workload. He recommends taking breaks from work, such as digital detox and spending quality time with family and friends, as another way to reduce burnout and stress.
He challenges the belief that productivity improves with longer working hours, calling it a myth. Single individuals, who often spend more time at work due to a lack of family commitments, should prioritise work-life balance.
He encourages leaders in agencies to promote a culture of work-life balance and mental health awareness in the workplace.  Dr Nanawar said there is availability of mental health services in hospitals and weekly clinics at the Pacific International Hospital and the Port Moresby General Hospital for them to visit."

“Together, we deliver Camp Management, Commercial Catering, Construction Services, Labour Hire and accredited Training Services,” said Peniai.
This JV allows landowners to take part in every stage of upstream project support, from running exploration camps to full-scale production facilities.
“It’s about giving our people meaningful roles — not just labour positions, but leadership and management opportunities. Through JPFSL, we’re creating an engine for landowner empowerment.”
2.	Jerilai Pujari Transport Limited (JPTL)
Through this subsidiary, JPHL ensures provides heavy vehicle transport, equipment hire, workshop services, small vessel operations and even aviation fuel handling. This is a JV designed not just to move goods, but to move our people forward.
3.	Jerilai Pujari Security Services Limited (JPSS)
JPSS is a joint venture with Guard Dog Security, one of PNG’s most respected security firms.
“Through JPSS, we provide professional guarding, secure transport, and electronic surveillance. What makes this JV different is that it is grounded in the local context. Our people understand the culture, the environment, and the sensitivities of working within their own communities. “
4.	HPNGL/JPHL Limited
HPNGL/JPHL Limited JPHL’s aviation partnership with Heli Niugini.
“Aviation is critical in a place like PNG, especially in PRL15 where terrain and weather can be unpredictable. Through this JV, we provide specialist helicopter services — medivacs, search and rescue, charter flights, and logistics support.”
JPHL’s broader vision is not for short-term profit but to reshape how landowners participate in resource projects.
“These joint ventures give us a seat at the table — not as silent partners, but as active contributors. Over time, we want to see more of our people in leadership roles, in skilled jobs, in management. We want profits reinvested back into community infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods. Through these partnerships, we’re not just supporting the Papua LNG Project — we’re building a sustainable future for our clans.”
JPHL’s commitment to meaningful landowner participation through these four Joint Ventures reflects a powerful model for inclusive development.
It is a story of vision, partnership, and long-term thinking — one that may well become a blueprint for landowner-led impact in Papua New Guinea’s resource sector."
CS graduates challenged to serve nation with pride,26/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5390,"Prime Minister James Marape has issued a heartfelt call to the 2025 graduating class of the Bomana Correctional Service Training College to serve Papua New Guinea with loyalty, pride, and national purpose, describing their graduation as a historic milestone in this 50th year of independence.
Speaking during the passing-out parade of 158 new Correctional Service officers, Prime Minister Marape congratulated the graduates on completing their training and reminded them of the national significance of their calling.
“You have made yourselves proud, your families proud, and most importantly, your country proud,” the Prime Minister said.
“You are not an ordinary class – you graduate in the year your country celebrates 50 years of independence. That makes you special. You are the generation who must now take this country forward.”
He also called on the graduates to embrace their national duties with integrity and a spirit of service above self.
“Take this moment to pledge your full loyalty – not to your tribe, not to your province, not to your family – but to your country,” he urged.
“We must recalibrate our mindset and reset our nation as we celebrate our Golden Jubilee. This starts with those of us in public service.”
He likened his role as Prime Minister not to that of a king or ruler, but as the “number one servant of the country,” welcoming the new officers into the wider family of public servants committed to nation-building.
Prime Minister Marape emphasised the crucial role of Correctional Services in addressing systemic issues such as unemployment, illiteracy, and tribalism, describing the institution as a frontline agency for “correcting the fault lines of our society that are turning into lawlessness.
“CS must not be at the back – it must come to the front,” he said.
“You are not in uniform for yourself, your family or your province. You wear it in the service of the country.”
He called on the Correctional Service Department and the broader Law and Justice Sector to reposition the institution as a “positive human resource contributor” to the nation’s future.
The Prime Minister also paid tribute to the officers who served since 1975, thanking them on behalf of all past Prime Ministers, and acknowledging their contribution to peace, order, and nation-building.
“To all warders who have served since independence, we thank you,” he said.
“To the graduating class of 2025 – go forth to your stations with pride, knowing you are sons and daughters of Papua New Guinea, deployed to make a positive impact.”
He closed by invoking God’s blessing on the graduates, their families, the Correctional Services Department, and the entire country.
“May God bless the graduating class of 2025 in this special year of our independence. May God bless Papua New Guinea always.”"

Bugandi prepares for new classroom,26/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5388,"Three old colonial buildings in Lae’s oldest school – the Bugandi Secondary School – are currently being demolished in preparation for the construction of a new 8-in-1 steel frame classroom for Grade 10.
Significant changes were noted by the member for Lae, John Rosso when Bugandi Secondary School had its administration replaced in 2022.
From no stationery, no uniforms and rundown infrastructure – most of which were built in the 60s – the school has progressed not just in terms of infrastructure, but also academically.
The demolition will make way for Bugandi’s third new 8-in-1 classroom. The first one was opened in 2024 and is currently occupied by Grade 12 students. The second one was opened for Grade 11 students on Monday, 10 February, 2025.
Lae MP, Rosso, highlighted the large influx of people due to rural-urban drift, with the city authority struggling to provide services. However, he stressed that all children deserve and have the right to quality education.
“And that is where the journey started when I first became elected, is that we are investing in our children’s future,” he stated. “Me and my generation are gone. The generation that will replace us is the one sitting behind us that we need to teach good values and discipline and most of all, have proper infrastructure, facilities, proper classrooms and good places of learning.
“Bugandi, the classrooms were built in the 1960s and as you can see, some of them have gone past their expiry date; the floors are broken, it’s overcrowded with 60-70 students to a classroom.”
Rosso outlined that the new 8-in-1 classrooms can hold up to 400 students, including offices for their teachers.
There are plans for another new Grade Nine classroom.
Rosso said teachers’ houses will also be renovated across all schools in Lae.
The MP will attend to one school at a time, when funding is available."

•	Kumul Consolidated Holdings Authorization Act 2002,
•	Kumul Consolidated Holdings Authorization (Amendment) Act 2021,
•	Public Finance (Management) Act 1995, and other related laws.

TOR 22 requires CLRC to consider several legislations, including;
•	Whether the penalty under section 223 of the Criminal Code should be reinstated to life imprisonment,
•	Whether the definition of incest should be expanded to include adopted and step-related relatives,
•	Whether consent should be a factor in sentencing, especially for adult cases,
•	Whether compensation or statutory customary should be abolished,
•	Need for compulsory sex education implemented in the school curriculum, and
•	Regulate sexually related content in the media
CLRC Chairman Saki Soloma said the launching of the TORs will ensure proper consultations are conducted and that laws are amended to the satisfaction of those affected.
“The issue papers launched today outline the background, key challenges, and legal and policy questions at the heart of each review. Following this launched the issue papers will be taken out for public and stakeholders' views.

International Court rules in favor of Pacific Island states,24/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5368,"The International Court of Justice has ruled in favour of Papua New Guinea and other Pacific Island countries, stating that these countries have legal obligations to prevent and address the harmful impacts of climate change.
The court, in its Advisory Opinion, found that the countries have binding legal obligations under international law and customary international law to prevent and address the harmful impacts of climate change.
The decision follows a request from the United Nations General Assembly for an Advisory Opinion regarding the climate change obligation of states. The initiative for this Advisory Opinion was championed at the United Nations by Vanuatu, inspired by a youth-led campaign calling for climate justice and legal accountability. This youth-driven movement underscored the urgency of international legal action in response to the worsening climate crisis.
According to the Minister for Justice and Attorney General Pila Niningi, PNG was among other countries that made an oral submission to the World Court, advocating for stronger legal accountability in the face of rising global emissions. The case was heard in December 2024.
“In our submission, we rallied with Vanuatu and other countries for this outcome. We are pleased with the outcome,” Minister Niningi said.
Minister Niningi led PNG’s representation which included PNG Ambassador to the United Nations Fred Sarufa, Secretary for the Department of Justice and Attorney General (DJAG) Dr Eric Kwa, Public Solicitor Leslie Mamu, and then Acting Solicitor General E'ava Geita. The team also comprised DJAG lawyers, Office of the Public Solicitor, and the Climate Change and Development Authority.
The World Court made the following key findings:
•	States must take action under both international treaties (e.g., UNFCCC, Paris Agreement, UNCLOS) and customary international law to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and protect the climate system;
•	Due diligence standards are high: States must adopt and enforce robust legal, regulatory, and policy activities to prevent environmental harm. Small Island Developing States were specifically recognized as especially vulnerable and legal protection from climate-related harm;
•	 States that breach their obligations, through acts or omissions, can be held responsible under international law for resulting harm to other States, peoples, and future generations;
•	The Court recognized climate change as a human rights issue, affirming the interdependence between environmental protection and rights to life, health, water, housing, and a clean and sustainable environment.
The Court's Opinion carries significant legal and political weight, and will;
•	Strengthen the legal basis for SIDS and vulnerable nations to demand meaningful climate action and support;
•	Serve as an authoritative guide for interpreting and applying international climate treaties, especially in the context of litigation and policy-making;
•	Provide a legal foundation for holding major emitters accountable where their emissions cause significant harm;
•	Reinforce Papua New Guinea's efforts to pursue international cooperation, climate financing, and technical assistance as a matter of legal entitlement, not charity;
•	Support integration of international climate and human rights standards into national laws, policies, and enforcement frameworks.
“This is a moment of immense pride for Papua New Guinea. Our voice was heard at the world's highest court,” Minister Niningi said. “The ruling confirms that climate justice is not just a political goal, it is a legal imperative.”
“I encourage all relevant agencies to use this decision to strengthen our domestic laws, advocate internationally, and protect our people and ecosystems for generations to come.
“Papua New Guinea reaffirms its commitment to working in solidarity with other small island nations and the international community to achieve effective, equitable, and legally grounded climate action,” Niningi added."

Ilakini described the redevelopment as a cornerstone investment in PNG’s fisheries future. “
Fifty years from now, this moment will still be remembered as a significant turning point for the fisheries sector and the people of Papua New Guinea,” he said.
Demolition work will conclude by the end of August, with a groundbreaking ceremony scheduled for September and full construction to begin in November 2025.
Japan has also pledged to supply a new fisheries research and training vessel to enhance maritime surveillance in PNG’s waters.
The project is aligned with the National Tuna Domestication Strategy 2025–2035 and aims to enhance capacity in coastal fisheries, post-harvest processing, commercial fishing, and marine resource sustainability. Over the years, PNG has received over USD 63.2 million in Japanese aid, boosting the fight against illegal fishing and supporting infrastructure and training needs.
President of Fisheries Engineering Co., Ltd, Uchida Akira, expressed full commitment to the timeline. “We look forward to delivering a world-class facility for the people of Papua New Guinea,” he said.
The Marape-Rosso government sees the redevelopment as a step toward its Vision 2030 agenda to reach a K200 billion economy through strategic partnerships, localized investment, and sustainable development."

Marape Defends Appointment of New KPHL Board in the Face of Court Order,23/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5351,"Prime Minister James Marape says the government will strongly defend its position following  what he termed as a  “surprise ex parte court order” obtained by former Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) Chairman, Dr Benedict Yaru.
Dr Yaru, who served for more than two terms—amounting to nine years— applied for the interim order in the absence of representation from the State or the trustee shareholder.
“This matter was taken to court in secret, without notifying the State or giving us the opportunity to be represented. An ex parte order was obtained, and we were only made aware after the fact,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“I want to assure the country that the State will respond once the order is formally served, and we will defend our position based on sound legal advice.”
Prime Minister Marape explained that the changes to the KPHL Board were made following due process and in accordance with legal guidance from the State Solicitor.
“The advice we received confirmed that a vacancy existed, and that the trustee shareholder—the Prime Minister—is legally empowered to appoint a new board. These appointments were necessary to restore proper governance oversight at Kumul Petroleum,” he said.
“It must be noted that most of the outgoing board members had already served two full terms—the legal maximum of eight years. In fact, Dr Yaru served nine years. One member had also surpassed the compulsory retirement age of 72.”
Prime Minister Marape further stressed that KPHL Board positions are not personal entitlements and must be refreshed regularly to ensure continued accountability and oversight.
“The KPHL Board is not owned by any one individual. Leadership must be rotated to bring in new perspectives and strengthen scrutiny of management.”
He also defended the appointment of Gerea Aopi as the new KPHL Chairman, describing him as a seasoned leader in the oil and gas sector.
“Mr Aopi is a highly respected Papua New Guinean with a distinguished record in both the public and private sectors. He knows the oil and gas industry, understands the strategic importance of Kumul Petroleum, and is well placed to guide its future growth.”
Prime Minister Marape concluded by stating that the Government will not be distracted by attempts to undermine the reform process at KPHL.
“Any citizen has the right to seek legal redress, and we respect that. However, we will robustly defend our position, which is based on sound legal advice, a commitment to transparency, and the need for a fresh board to provide oversight of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Ltd in our national interest."
Engineering Battalion Soldiers Reach Ramu Valley,23/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5350,"About 20 soldiers from the Engineering Battalion who received the baton from 2RPIR soldiers in Madang on Saturday, July 16th 2025 have reached the Ramu Valley as of midday today, covering 128km over four days.
According to Captain Robert Paka, it was a tough and long walk from Madang to Ramu with soldiers sustaining bruises along the way, but assured that their morale stands high with the mission to ensure the message from the Chief of Defence reaches Markham for the next leg.

Police band recognized,23/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5348,"Since the 1970s to the 1980s, four pioneers who joined the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary band have been privileged to perform on home soil during the 2025 Pacific Police Tattoo held yesterday at the Sir Hubert Murray Stadium in the nation's capital.
The band, led by Director of Music, Inspector Lucas Nege, and is managed by Band Master Inspector Alu Kapa. The band was formed in 1938 in Nodup Village near Rabaul after the musical talents of local village boys were noticed by the founder and band master, the late David Crawley.
Regional bands based in Rabaul, Mount Hagen, Madang, and Port Moresby were brought together in 1975, and since 1982, the band has been based in Port Moresby. The band currently has 90 members, including six pioneer policewomen, and performs regularly on the international stage in places such as Australia, Japan, England, and Scotland.
However, most of the pioneers retired, with others passing on, leaving only four pioneers standing strong to hold the band together 50 years after PNG gained independence. They are Sergeant John Api, Inspector Lucas Nege, Inspector Alu Kapa, and Chief Sergeant Richard Gei.
Director Nege said being recognized as the best drill performers on home soil signifies the band’s commitment and the efforts, they put into practicing one year ahead of the Tattoo.
“We've been preparing for this Tattoo event since last year, and to get an award is not a surprise because we worked very hard. The result of our hard work speaks for itself today,” Nege said.
He said this achievement is history in the making, not only for the band but an achievement for the people of PNG. As they transition into the retirement era, their contributions to the band will have a lasting impact on future band members and an inspiration to future generations."

The celebration was graced by Simbu Governor Noah Kool, Simbu Provincial Administrator John Punde, and Provincial Police Commander Mazuic Maipe, who acknowledged the historic role of police in Simbu, including those who served before and during independence.
Commander Maipe led the parade alongside Mobile Squad Unit 08 and local officers. “We marched today (Monday) with pride, not only as police officers but as servants of humanity. I want to thank those who came before us and those still serving,” he said. “Only God knows our hard work toward the people of Papua New Guinea.”

The RMS were a prominent German Protestant missionary organization that played a significant role in spreading Christianity to various parts of the world including New Guinea.

PM pays tribute to fallen heroes,23/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5345,"Prime Minister James Marape pays tribute to Papua New Guinea’s ‘fallen heroes’ as the nation observes National Remembrance Day today.
This year’s commemoration holds even deeper significance as PNG celebrates 50 years of Independence this September 16 — a milestone of nationhood achieved through the courage, sacrifice, and resilience of those who served and defended the country, beginning with the World War II generation.
“As we stand on the shoulders of heroes and celebrate 50 years as an independent nation, we pause to honour those whose blood was shed so we could be free,” said Prime Minister Marape.
“Remembrance Day is not only a day of tribute - it is a reminder of our duty to uphold the values they fought for.”
Remembrance Day also reflects on the enduring friendship between PNG and Australia, forged in the crucible of war during the historic Kokoda Campaign of 1942.
Papua New Guinean carriers, famously known as the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels, supported wounded Australian troops through treacherous jungle conditions, embodying humanity, bravery, and unity under fire.
Last year (2024), this historic bond was symbolically renewed when Prime Minister Marape and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese walked the Kokoda Track together, retracing the footsteps of soldiers and carriers from both nations.
“Walking Kokoda with Prime Minister Albanese was more than a physical journey - it was a spiritual honour,” Marape said.
“It reminded both our nations of the deep, shared history that binds us. The brotherhood between Papua New Guinea and Australia was born on those muddy, sacred trails, and it lives on today.”
The walk marked the first time that the Prime Ministers of both countries undertook the pilgrimage together, sending a strong signal of bilateral solidarity, remembrance, and regional cooperation.
National Remembrance Day, observed annually on July 23, honours all Papua New Guineans who served in military and defence roles from World War II to today, including peacekeeping missions and national operations.
“As we celebrate our golden jubilee of independence, may we honour our defenders by being a people of unity, service, and purpose,” said Marape.
Across the nation in designated locations, ceremonies, flag raisings, and tributes are being held.
Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed his government’s commitment to strengthening the PNG Defence Force and building national pride through education, training, and regional partnerships.
“Our heroes left us a legacy - our task now is to build a stronger, more secure and sovereign nation. We will continue investing in our Defence Force, and in shaping a generation of citizens who love and defend this country with honour.”
“We are one people, from many tribes, bound by the memory of sacrifice and the dream of a greater Papua New Guinea. Let this Remembrance Day stir in us pride, gratitude, and determination to rise together for the next 50 years and beyond.”"

Polling concludes in Kabwum,23/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5343,"Polling in the Kabwum by-election has concluded with the extraction of the first lot of ballot boxes and papers to Lae, in Morobe Province.
Kabwum’s returning officer, James Neapukali, landed in Lae this morning with the six ballot boxes from Selepet local level government.
The people of Kabwum district never had a political representative since the Electoral Commissioner’s declaration of Patrick Basa ‘under special circumstances’ was nullified by the court in 2023.
They are now a step closer to having their voices represented at the national level with the conclusion of polling for the Kabwum Open seat.
Neapukali said this morning, the six ballot boxes from Selepet LLG were extracted to Lae on a chopper.
Under the watchful eyes of Mobile Squad 15, the ballot boxes were put into containers at the Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium, where counting is scheduled to take place.
Neapukali outlined that they had no issues with teams from Selepet, Komba and Deyamos due to road accessibility, compared to Yus.
“The road conditions are not good but vehicles could use them so policemen were able to go to the polling sites,” he stated.
“Only for Yus, because of no network coverage there, we could not get in touch with all the teams. But we did manage to get in contact with three teams that were going towards Teptep, towards the Madang side, so the network there was working and they reported to us that they had already completed.
“Otherwise, manpower in Kabwum is ok, compared to the last general election.
“And this time we have MS 15; all sections of MS 15, including one section of SRU (Special Response Unit) and police from the provincial headquarters as well.”
Since the Usino-Bundi by-election in Madang Province is also underway, Neapukali said the chopper is alternating between the two polling districts.
In spite of a few challenges, such as voters getting frustrated when their names are not in the electoral roll, Neapukali said the team managed to peacefully conclude polling and are now looking forward to starting the counting process."

A recollection of the unsung heroes by Madang PPC,23/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5340,"This morning, I woke up early, sitting quietly in my room, reflecting on the journey of this young nation over the past fifty-plus years. As I gaze into the memories of the past, I am reminded of the sacrifices made by countless heroes - those who fought bravely during World War II, including my own late dad.
My late dad used to tell us tales and experiences of how he fought side by side with fellow soldiers, joining the allied forces on the coastlines of Morobe and Madang to defend freedom and peace. Today, I understand the profound significance of this day - the day we honor those who laid down their lives for our future.
I also recall the Bougainville crisis, where I actively participated in restoring peace to our land. I remember the comrades we lost during those turbulent times, and the sacrifices they made for our nation’s stability and unity.
These memories inspire me to uphold the oath I took—to serve my country without fear, favor, or malice.
I served in Bougainville because I believe in one people, one nation. My sacrifice was driven not by personal gain, but by love for my homeland, my family, and my people - so that peace and unity may prevail.
Today, I stand in respect and gratitude for all the heroes who sacrificed for our well-being. I especially honor my late dad, whose sacrifices paved the way for the life I live today.
To all the heroes - your courage and sacrifice will never be forgotten. I salute you.
""Thou shall not get old till we meet again on that golden morning when the trumpet sounds."""

This newsroom reached out to PNG NRL Franchise CEO, Andrew Hill to comment on whether the board has decided on an interim director, but attempts were unsuccessful.
The Sydney Morning Herald, last week alleged that Sonk as the Managing Director of KPHL was involved in corrupt dealings, questioning his credibility as a director on the new PNG NRL board.

New KPHL board appointment stayed,22/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5337,"The appointment of Gerea Aopi as the new board chairman of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited and the subsequent appointment of three other board members by the Prime Minister James Marape as the trustee of KPHL was stayed by the National Court today.
Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika delivered the ruling this afternoon after the applicant, Dr Benedict Yalu who is the chairman of KPHL filed an exparte application seeking the court to grant him leave to dispense with the requirement for filing and service of the Originating Summons, Notice of Motion, affidavit in support and undertaking as damages.
He sought three orders pending this application of which all three orders were granted:
a)	The National Court stayed the Prime Minister’s decision to appoint Gerea Aopi as the Chairman of KPHL on June 10, 2025, and the decision issued on June 26, 2025 for the appointment of George Gware, Jacob Anga, and Sundaram Srinivasan as directors of KPHL pending hearing and determination of the proceeding.
b)	Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika also ordered that the decisions made by the Defendant on June 10, 2025 and on June 26, 2025 assuming that Dr Benedict Yaru, Dr lla Temu and Paul Nerau, and Peterson Pipj, Hari Karyuliarto, have been retired and removed as Chairman and directors of KPHL, by operation of the Petroleum Holdings Limited Authorization Act 2015, and therefore further assuming that there is no board or quorum in place, be stayed pending hearing and determination of the proceeding.
c)	And the court further ordered that the defendant (Prime Minister James Marape) and his agents, servants, associates, delegate and persons directed by them or whomsoever be restrained from relying on and giving effect to the instrument issued by the defendant dated June 10, 2025 and the further instruments.
The Court heard that on May 07, 2025, the Board of KPHL through the Chairman, informed the Prime Minister as the Trustee of the Kumul Petroleum Share Trust ('Trustee') that there were three (3) vacancies in the Director positions.
On 10 June 2025, the Prime Minister appointed Gerea Aopi as Chairman and on 26 June 2025, the Prime Minister, acting as the Trustee of KPHL, made appointments of  new Directors to the KPHL Board, citing reasons that there was no quorum in the board.
However, the applicant (Dr Benedict Yalu) told the court that these appointments were not made in accordance with Section 10 of the Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited Authorization Act 2015 (the KPHL Act), which clearly sets out how such appointments must be made.
Dr Benedict Yalu has been the Chairman of Kumul petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) since the commencement of KPHL in 2015 along with several other Directors to whom he is representing in this proceedings."

Jets coach Tye Ingebrigtsen acknowledged that it was a game of two halves, with the Jets rallying in the second half to score four unanswered tries themselves.

Unfortunately, we didn't come out strong, whereas they did, and they deserved that first-half lead. They were outstanding,"" Ingebrigtsen said.
The Jets made adjustments in the second half, modifying their game plan to move the ball more effectively and utilizing kicks to score, as they struggled to penetrate the Hunters' defensive line.
Ingebrigtsen said, “We talked about throwing the ball around in the second half. Our original plan was to go through the middle, but PNG defended that area so well in the first half that we had to adapt. We just ran out of time,"" he explained.
He also noted the challenges posed by the hot conditions in Port Moresby, which the players were not accustomed to, but expressed confidence that the team would regroup and focus on their upcoming match in round 19 coming weekend."
ABG presents K1 million to MAF to re-establish presence in the region,22/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5332,"The Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) presented a cheque of K1 million to Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) to re-establish its aviation services in the region.
The cheque is part of the ABG’s financial support toward MAF’s Phase 1 infrastructure projects following the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the ABG and the MAF earlier this year.
Presenting the cheque yesterday on behalf of the ABG, Chief Secretary Kearnneth Nanei said the gesture symbolised the government's appreciation and ongoing partnership with MAF, following the signing of the MoU in which President Ishmael Toroama committed K1 million in support.
“Today, it gives me great pleasure and honour on behalf of the President, ABG and people of Bougainville to handover this K1million cheque to MAF of PNG as ABG’s commitment to reestablish MAF in Bougainville,” he said.
Nanei reiterated that the presentation showed ABG’s commitment towards building and opening up the airspace in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (AROB) and the ABG’s commitment to further align with MAF’s priorities on the ground to re-establish and re-develop MAF as a third level airline throughout AROB.
The Chief Secretary further noted that the funding aligns with ABG’s broader goals of accessibility and connectivity across the region as contained in the Bougainville Vision 2052, Bougainville Integrated Strategic Development Plan 2023-2027 and the soon-to-launched Bougainville Transport Master Plan.
“This is all aligned with these critical blueprints that within the next ten years we are required to open up the skies within Bougainville and re-access our airstrips in Nissan, Buin, Torokina, Oria and in mountainous communities,” he said.
He acknowledged the services that MAF had provided during the pre-conflict days and said that it is not only a partnership with the government but with the churches and the people of AROB who have been in partnership with MAF during the Boug-Air days.
Nanei further added that he is aware that the MAF will use ABG’s support to build an aircraft hangar at the Buka airport, paving the way for an enduring partnership.
“We look forward to the partnership in building the hangar and eventually a taxi way, at least this will be a significant milestone for our partnership, and I see this as an enduring partnership,” he said.
MAF Launch Team Director John Woodberry upon receiving the cheque thanked the ABG for its support and also acknowledged Bishop Abraham Toroi and the Bougainville Christian Council of Churches who have been key partners in inviting MAF back to Bougainville.
“Your contribution to MAF is a gigantic first step to helping MAF establish again in Bougainville. MAF has a history in Bougainville from 1968 to 1978 in helping launch Boug-Air and we have the heart to bring health, hope and healing to remote people in communities around Bougainville,” he said.
Woodberry confirmed that the valuable contribution will be applied directly to the construction of their aircraft hangar at Buka airport.
“This hangar is a crucial part of establishing our aviation operations in AROB and will enable us to serve isolated communities with essential health, education, governance, church support and other crucial services,” he said.
MAF aims to launch its operations once the hangar is completed, staffed and an aircraft is based in Bougainville by early 2026."

Challenges faced by first years,21/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5324,"It’s always a tough transition when students from secondary schools enter tertiary institutions for the first time.
This was one of the papers presented at the recent 6th Pacific Islands Universities Regional Network (PIURN) conference, at the PNG University of Technology in Lae, Morobe Province.
The research paper was titled: “The transition of secondary students into higher tertiary education: the perspectives of Divine Word University, Madang province, Papua New Guinea”.
It was authored by Divine Word University’s head of rehabilitation sciences & physiotherapy department, Rhonda Wohemani, and the postgraduate senior liaison officer from the Solomon Islands National University, Emelda Ariku.
Wohemani explained that since teaching at the Divine Word University for the last 15 years, she and Ariku identified some challenges and barriers that affect first year students.
“They were struggling with how they can academically cope with the life,” stated Wohemani. “Coming from a structured system of education, and just throwing them into a higher institution where there are flexible times and everything is just there; they found it very difficult to cope with the academic life and that was why we decided to do a study on it.
“The main purpose was to identify challenges and barriers secondary students experience when transiting into higher tertiary institutions.”
One of the main challenges identified by Wohemani and Ariku was adapting to a new environment.
One of the students interviewed highlighted the language barrier between rural and urban students, especially when they are in the same accommodation. While urban students have no problem communicating in English, those from the rural areas have difficulties expressing themselves fluently in English.
“The other one was with e-learning,” continued Wohemani. “Since Divine Word is on top of digital learning and everything is done online with less paper used; the problem of students was, how they could adjust to it.
“If they had been introduced in secondary school about how to use computers and how to, for example, do ‘flipped classroom’, then smooth transition will happen when they go into their first year – foundation.
“The other one was a support system for non-academic and academic programs on campus as well.
“Yes, Divine Word has a support system like mentoring programs, psycho-education, Toastmasters and counselling sessions. We’ve identified that it needs to be strengthened. Yes, we have it, but why don’t we strengthen it by having it on a weekly basis.”
The presenters recommended that students be exposed to the flipped classroom approach, or blended learning, while they are still in secondary school. This type of learning is where students access new content at home – either videos or readings – then later engage in interactive activities with their teachers.
Ariku, who relocated to the Solomon Islands last year, said the qualitative study involved 15 first year DWU students in the first semester – from January to May 2025.
“I was working at DWU as a graduate researcher and a tutor for the last four years,” explained Ariku. “As a lecturer in the Department of Health Management and System Development, under the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, I identified this gap and was motivated to do research in this area.”
Research is still continuing, and the presenters hope to expand the study to other universities to help bridge the gap for transitioning students."
PNGETV 2027 ready for September launch,21/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5323,"The Department of Education has concluded the consultations to finally complete writing the Papua New Guinea Education Transformation Vision 2075 (PNGETV 2075). The Department plans to launch document during the country’s 50th Independence celebrations in September.
The final consultation was conducted in close consultation with the National Research Institute (NRI) on Wednesday 9 July 2025, bringing the Ministry of Education and Papua New Guinea closer to launching a comprehensive 50-year roadmap for the future of education in PNG.
In his address, Secretary for Education, Dr. Uke Kombra, emphasised the importance of wide stakeholder consultations and contributions to shape and complete the document so that it is owned by each and every Papua New Guinean.
""You all play a very critical role in the education system. Our education system would not have come this far without the partnership and the contributions that you have made as development partners, church representatives, teachers, and the different roles you play in the education space.
This document, which we hope to launch by September, will not be complete and cannot be launched without the involvement and contributions from stakeholders in the education sector,"" Dr. Kombra stated.
The Secretary thanked Dr. George Bopi, the lead technical advisor, and his dedicated team, Teddy Winn and Maureen Yali, for their efforts in driving the PNGETV 2075 project. He also all the participants, including development partners, church representatives, and teachers, for their invaluable contributions.
The PNGETV 2075, a long-term vision spanning from 2026 to 2075, aims to establish a future direction for PNG's education system to be inclusive, adaptive, and transformative.
The Secretary highlighted the significant growth of the education sector since independence, with teacher numbers increasing from 6,000 to over 70,000, and student enrolment reaching close to 2.7 million across more than 13,000 schools.
Despite this progress, Dr. Kombra acknowledged persistent challenges, particularly to do with relevant curriculum and student retention.
""Our curriculum is being critiqued as not being relevant to equip the children for the next life they will pursue in society,"" he noted.
However, he reaffirmed the Department's commitment to addressing these issues through the new vision.
The core principle guiding the PNGETV 2075 is to ensure that every child, regardless of gender, disability, economic status, or geography, receives the best quality education he or she deserves. This aligns with the constitutional directive for the education sector to lead in integral human development.
The consultation process for PNGETV 2075 has been extensive, involving a steering committee chaired by the Minister for Education and a dedicated technical team for the past one to two years.
Dr. Kombra reiterated that the final document will reflect the widespread inputs, reflecting the collective aspirations of Papua New Guineans.
""It should not be a document that is written in Vulupindi Haus or by the Education Department. It must be a document that must include the input and views of everyone in the society,"" he stated.
The 50-year vision will serve as a guiding framework, informing National Education Plans for every 10-year period, which will then be cascaded into three-year corporate plans and provincial education implementation plans.
The Secretary thanked participants for their time and contributions and added that the team from the PNGETV 2027 Secretariat will include their comments and advice in the final document."
Legacy issues affect Modilon hospital service delivery,20/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5316,"The Madang Provincial Health Authority (MaPHA) has undergone negative speculations arising from lack of facilities, deteriorating infrastructures, medicine shortages and an overall decline in basic health services in the recent months.
MaPHA chairman, Dr. Figa Boga has come out to clear the air as to why these issues have eventually spilled over in recent years, claiming that it is a legacy issue which has encapsulated its current administration, crippling the flow of services. However, Dr. Boga is adamant that steps are being pursued to ensure the adversities are reined on.
Dr. Boga explained how in 2019 when the Health Authorities were established nationwide, Madang’s Modilon General Hospital was left without a Board until September 2024, running operations without an overseer. In addition to its establishments, the Authorities nullified all Acts of prevalent governing and external avenues of funding, especially from provincial sources.
This merger did not work out with the structuring resulting in discrepancies arising, such as in Madang’s case, a total of 400 positions remained vacant with staff performing under casual basis. Overall Dr. Boga also highlights that even during its establishment, there were no proper Corporate Plans or Health Plans created in order to attract funding.
It is understood that the hospital itself plus its operations costs approximately K18 million per annum, however, for this year’s budget, it is stated that submission was made for K22.5 million. With the Board’s intention of laying out new priority projects, not much can be availed to carry out these activities resulting in the crippling effect that has taken its toll on the institution.
Dr. Boga also shed light on a K15 million which was given by the then Minister for Health Dr. Tom Lino in 2022 for the hospitals use, however, this funding was unavailable due to the lack of a Board in that period. This has now been sought out and the Board anticipates its release in the coming week.
Without denying claims made by members of the public on MaPHA’s deteriorating state, Dr. Boga acknowledges that current infrastructures need to be replaced by modern structures, those ongoing projects of the outpatient, emergency and wards will be under construction soon to be completed after years in standstill.
The Board deliberated in an emergency meeting that K1. 4m will be used from the K15 million to complete the outpatient, A&E and mothers’ ward.
They will also look into alternate sustainable power and water supply sources for the hospital; however, he thanked the Madang Provincial Government for stepping in committing two Southern Crosses which will replace the current ones which has been erected since the 1960’s.
While the challenges remain for the Board and its administrative team in the forefront, a bustling and robust effort is in play in the background trying to realign MaPHA into place."

“I would like to, on behalf of the PNG Chamber of Resources and Energy, and from the PNG Resources Golden Expo team, sincerely thank Cricket PNG for bringing our two champion teams, the Barramundis and the Lewas, to visit the PNG Resources Golden Expo today. We are privileged to have them.
""They're the first sporting teams to come and visit the apart from the general public, and a lot of the schools that have visited. We thank Cricket PNG for the collaboration, and we hope that the teams have learned something new today, being exposed to the mining and petroleum industry through their visits to the exhibition booths and talking to the participants at the exhibition,"" she added.
The exhibition was an eye-opening exploration into the industries that fuel the nation’s progress. The visit offered players a broader understanding of PNG’s industrial landscape and opened their minds to possible career pathways beyond sport. It aligns with Cricket PNG’s holistic approach to player development, which includes not only athletic skills but also personal and professional growth.
The experience not only positioned the national cricket teams before influential industry stakeholders and potential sponsors but also strengthened its identity as a progressive and community-connected sporting body."

The six-week programme started on July 14th and will resume from August 18th to 22nd.
The initiative aims to build confidence, creativity, and pathways into the arts for students in Grades 9 to 11 in the National Capital District Schools.
Since its inception in 2016, YAP has reached over 600 students annually from more than 15 schools, tutors from MAT and student teachers from UoG mentor participants, blending arts training with social awareness. NGOs and local organisations also join in, using theatre as a platform to engage youth on critical issues.

Dr. Awi says this interest reflects the critical need for structured opportunities for young people to engage in creative and artistic expressions.
“We call on the National Department of Education to integrate arts education as a core subject, establish dedicated teaching roles, and offer scholarships and grants for budding creatives,” she said.
“Creative expression is not a luxury—it’s identity-building and nation-shaping. The arts train minds to see possibility,"" Dr. Awi added. ""Now, imagine what that could mean for Papua New Guinea.""
She also urged development partners to support postgraduate studies and teacher training in the creative industries, and encouraged aspiring artists to enroll at UoG’s Creative Arts and Communication Division, which is responsible for training arts educators. MAT’s ongoing collaboration with UoG, sponsors, and schools offers more than just performance; it is a movement to revive arts education in PNG and empower the next generation of storytellers.
This year's theme is” The Empty Space.” This means the students will bring their plays to life through captivating and thought-provoking performances and explore how to create a scene on stage through their imagination, movement, and speech.
From August 18–22, the schools will be presenting short plays before a live audience and judging panel. Winners will receive awards across categories, including Play, Acting, Directing, Technical Design, and Stage Management, closing the YAP 2025, with award events.

While the reports have not originated from within Papua New Guinea, they involve serious claims that touch on the governance and integrity of one of our most strategic State-owned enterprises.”
The Prime Minister confirmed that a formal written request would be made to the media outlet to provide the full evidence and documentation upon which the reports are based.
“At this point, I have not received any official complaint locally, but I will be requesting all relevant information to allow us to assess the matter responsibly and objectively,” Prime Minister Marape said.
He added that a formal letter will also be sent to Mr Sonk, requesting a written explanation in response to the published allegations.
“As Trustee, I will ensure that due process is followed. If these allegations are substantiated through credible evidence, the appropriate steps will be taken in line with corporate governance procedures under the KPHL Act and other applicable regulations.”
Prime Minister Marape emphasised that while the allegations relate primarily to Kumul Petroleum’s dealings, their gravity warrants a careful and transparent review to uphold the integrity of the company.
“Let me make it clear — no one is above accountability. If impropriety is established, then appropriate action will follow. Kumul Petroleum must operate at the highest standards of transparency and ethical conduct, given its critical role in managing the State’s petroleum interests.”
He further stated that the matter will not be prejudged but will proceed based on facts and established protocols.
“I have asked that Mr Sonk, as the subject of these reports, also provide full clarification on his various roles — including his position on the PNG-NRL franchise board — to avoid any risk of reputational compromise to KPHL or the State.”
Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed that protecting the credibility and operational integrity of Kumul Petroleum is paramount.
“Our international partners, investors, and our own citizens expect that State enterprises are managed honestly and professionally. As Trustee, I am committed to upholding those expectations and will act without fear or favour.”"
TVI Building Local Leadership & Collective Action,18/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5291,"Over the last four years local civil society organization, The Voice Inc. (TVI) has been strategically engaging with governments, community organizations, civil societies and its network of leaders, building coalitions to progress policy and reform on some of Papua New Guinea’s most critical issues such as Sorcery Accusation Related Violence (SARV), Youth Opportunities and Early Childhood Learning.
Key to its efforts is the Problem Driven Iterative Adaptation (PDIA) Course facilitated by the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and offered through TVI’s Local Leadership and Collective Action Program (LLCAP).
The PDIA course is a challenging 12-week program which helps teams break down problems into root causes, identify entry points and act. The program has been delivered with governments and reformers around the world including LLCAP leaders in PNG since 2022.
Through the PDIA, TVI has been able to engage with 112 local leaders. These exceptional leaders include community advocates, organizational executives, public servants and government secretaries among others.
TVI Executive Director, Maliwai Sasingian said the organization has seen tangible results from engaging with the three cohorts that have gone through this course. These engagements have led to key partnerships and strategic interventions that LLCAP actively supports.
“Through the PDIA process, we have been able to mobilize and support key coalition actions such strengthening referral pathways and access to justice for survivors of SARV with key stakeholders on the frontline addressing the issue in Kundiawa, Simbu Province.
“Through our continued engagement with this important coalition and learnings from the PDIA, TVI in partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Kundiawa, established a free SARV Legal Help Desk in 2023 with a fulltime lawyer to assist partners in progressing their SARV cases. This is among many examples of the utilization of key concepts within the PDIA course,” said Sasingian.
Other key partnerships that have come to fruition through the PDIA process include Memorandum of Understandings (MOAs) and Joint Workplans with the Department for Community Development & Religion  (DFCDR) and the National Youth Development Authority (NYDA).
TVI’s coalition efforts and continued engagement with stakeholders through the Local Leadership Collective Action Program (LLCAP) is supported by the Australian Government through the Building Community Engagement Program (BCEP) in Papua New Guinea."

The Clifton/ Ah Sing Resettlement area is among a total of nine resettlement areas the ENB Provincial Government had identified to resettle people affected by the 1994 volcanic eruptions and other key land mobilisation programs. Eight of these are in the Rabaul District.
Provincial Administrator, Levi Mano, told the Clifton people that the issuance of land titles which began last year saw 199 titles given to the people of Sikut Talvat, and is now continuing at Clifton/Ah Sing. This program will continue to other resettlement areas facing the same issue.
“The land title process is a crucial step towards addressing the issues faced by our people in all our resettlement areas. Once they receive their titles, they will have ownership of the land they are currently living on, and this will bring a sense of security and stability to their lives,” Mano said.
Meantime, Lemeki commended the people for cooperating with the Lands Technical Team to fast track the process of title issuance. He urged the people to make use of their blocks of land for economic benefits.
The people of Clifton/Ah Sing welcomed this significant development, saying it now brings hope and security to their people who have been facing challenges related to land ownership.
Nineteen officers from the Provincial Lands Division have been camping at Clifton since the start of this month (July), conducting physical inspection, valuation, drone pick-ups, population census and data entry to pave way for the title issuances.
Ten reserve blocks are part of 477 blocks within the 699 hectares at Clifton/Ah Sing resettlement area."

Holy Moses deported,18/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5283,"A foreign national who has been involved in a sophisticated transnational criminal network in Papua New Guinea under multiple names including “Holy Moses” was deported last week to Singapore and onto Dubai.
Mr. Amaechi also known by multiple aliases including ""Holy Moses"" and ""Cedric Sedibe Nduduzie"", was removed from Papua New Guinea on 16 July 2025 escorted to Singapore, where he will transit to Dubai with the assistance of Singaporean Immigration Officials.
Mr. Amaechi is known to be involved in the manufacture and distribution of counterfeit currency and the trafficking of methamphetamines and other hard drugs.
He has been closely linked to organized crime syndicates operating across Asia, Latin America, particularly Mexico, and the Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand.
The Immigration and Citizenship Services Authority confirmed the successful deportation of Remigius Amaechi, following an intensive covert operation led by ICSA's Compliance and Enforcement Division in collaboration with the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary.
His presence and unlawful entry into Papua New Guinea, using fake travel documents, constitute a breach of Chapter 16 of the Migration Act 1978, which warrants immediate action and investigation.
Mr. Amaechi was previously apprehended in 2016 under a false identity for printing counterfeit U.S. currency within PNG and was deported thereafter.
Intelligence-led operations revealed that Mr. Amaechi re-entered PNG illegally through the Wutung land border post from Indonesia on 3 October 2024, using a fraudulently obtained Nigerian passport under a new name.
He was apprehended on 25 February 2025 by the Police Dog Unit and ICSA Enforcement Team after being traced and placed under surveillance.
A forensic examination of his mobile phone uncovered disturbing details of his direct contacts with operatives of drugs syndicate using known foreign established businesses to coordinate shipments of illicit drugs into PNG with confirmed communications with international contacts across Mexico, Thailand, and Australia.
These findings point to Mr. Amaechi's central role in a wider Pacific drug syndicate, using PNG as a transit route for illegal drugs destined for Australia and New Zealand.
""This removal underscores the firm stance of the Papua New Guinea Government and the Immigration & Citizenship Services Authority against transnational crime. We will not allow our sovereign borders to be used as a safe haven, transit route, or operational base for organized criminal networks aided by foreign nationals.
The removal of Holy Moses is a result of close inter-agency collaboration, precise intelligence, and decisive enforcement action.
“I commend the dedication of our officers and reaffirm our commitment to securing Papua New Guinea's border against foreign criminal threats."" Chief Migration Officer Wellington Navasivu said."

Police deal with fake news Public praised for reporting fake news,17/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5280,"The Commissioner of Police, David Manning, has thanked the public for being active in reporting fake news circulated on social media by political opportunists. The Commissioner's comments follow a number of recent social media posts fraudulently alleging incidents of crime.
""There have been a number of recent posts by known political opportunists who have nothing else to do but talk our country down,"" the Commissioner said. “One matter in particular is the photo of a young expatriate person with a knife impaling their hand. The political activist claimed that this was a violent attack by rascals upon an expatriate in Kimbe. The reality is that this was a fishing accident that happened in another country.”
""Police examined the post and identified details which indicated the photograph was not taken in Papua New Guinea. Following communication with our Pacific policing partners, the incident was confirmed as having occurred more than 2,000km away in another country.
""What was just as encouraging is that members of the public reported the social media posts to police, after forming doubt as to the truth of the post,” he said.
Commissioner Manning said these individuals must accept that they are breaking the law and will be called in for a police interview.
""Intentionally spreading fear or causing public alarm is an offence. In this instance, it is clear that the person responsible for the post acted with malicious intent and they will be held accountable for their actions,” He added."

PNGNA launches Savings & Loans service,17/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5272,"The PNG Nurses Association (PNGNA) yesterday launched its Savings & Loans Society. Six members also received their certificates and signed loan applications. PNGNA S&LS Chief Executive Officer Justeen Pindipi said the essence of the launch is the processing of the loan application.
After the launch, six staff from Port Moresby General Hospital and two from Laloki Psychiatric Hospital, as well as PNG Nurses Association President Freddy Kebai submitted their loan applications. Their accounts were expected to be credited today.
“Now we are online. That’s the keynote part of what we are launching as the Savings & Loans,” Pindipi said.
The maximum loan guaranteed is K20,000 and minimum is K500.
“The loan interest component is one percent as approved by the regulator, the Bank of PNG. You cannot go up, you cannot come down. When you want to go up, we have justified cases, i.e justifiable cases that means we have to go to get increase of 1:2 or ratio of 1:3, 1:5.  We’ll have to seek authority from the regulator,” he added.
The appeal now from the PNG Nurses Association is for the rest of the 4,000 registered nurses to complete the Savings and Loans membership forms to be eligible for a loan.
PNGNA S&LS Chairman and PNG Nurses Association president Freddy Kebai said, “It is really a new dawn in the financial liberation for the nurses in the country. We are trying to liberate them out from their financial burdens, and give them the financial freedom.”
“It is the congress’s decision to establish this PNG Nurses Savings & Loans Society and becoming a member is taking quite a while.
“Funding doesn’t come from the government, nor from the Bank of Papua New Guinea, or even from the Federation’s Savings & Loans society.
“It is from their own pocket that established this entity,” Kebai said.
Mr Kebai appealed to PNGA members to take ownership of this service for financial freedom."

With the Western and Central Pacific region contributing nearly 60% of global tuna supplies, PNG’s role is seen as pivotal in setting the tone for long-term sustainability, innovation, and inclusive economic development within the fisheries sector.
The Pacific Tuna Forum was first launched in 2007 and has since grown into a key dialogue platform for addressing global seafood trends, trade opportunities, and ocean governance, especially from a Pacific-led perspective.
PNG is expected to present case studies on its tuna processing investments, advancements in traceability and eco-labelling, and ongoing efforts to empower women and communities in fisheries.
The National Fisheries Authority says a high-level PNG delegation will attend the forum, with public-private stakeholders working closely to ensure a united voice for Pacific Island nations."

It was also alleged that the vehicle looked suspicious, so the police who maintained the checkpoint at Kikori searched the vehicle and questioned the driver and the crew, who then gave information on the suspects that led to the arrest of two suspects, including the driver and the crew. One suspect in the vehicle escaped.
Police also alleged that seven other suspects were on the dinghy to transfer drugs from the land cruiser to the Western province. The two suspects were apprehended on Sunday, 13th July 2025, along the Kikori river, whilst one was caught on Monday, July 14th, and two were caught on Tuesday, July 15th. Two suspects escaped.
Initially, there were five suspects in the Land Cruiser, but four were apprehended and one escaped. While seven were in the dinghy, five were arrested and two escaped. Brings the total to nine arrested and three are on the run.
“Gulf is leading in the accumulated years in court convictions. We got one male convicted for 40 years at Malalaua District Court in Kerema for conveying and in possession of five kilograms of marijuana under the amended Dangerous Drug Act.
“The public must be aware that the amended Dangerous Drug Act and Controlled Substances Act are very tough on perpetrators. They must think twice before deciding to get involved in the drug business because the penalties are severe,” said PPC Lemb."
PNG Music Mourns Barike Pioneer Matalau Nakikus,16/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5239,"Papua New Guinea is mourning the sudden passing of Matalau Nakikus, a founding member of the legendary Barike Band.
He died on Monday following ongoing health complications.
Nakikus was a pioneering figure in PNG music, best known for helping create the iconic Tolai Rock sound—a powerful blend of traditional Tolai rhythms with reggae and rock.
He co-wrote and performed national hits such as “Wan Kantri”, “Iau Ra Biavi”, and “Rabaul Town.”
Born in Rabaul, Nakikus was also a teacher, lawyer, and cultural advocate who inspired generations of musicians.
Matalau Nakikus was more than a musician—he was the heartbeat of a generation. Through the keys of his keyboard and the strength of his voice, he told the story of a people, a culture, and a country still discovering its identity. With Barike, he didn’t just make music—he made history.
From the warbat beats of Rabaul to the national anthem-like “Wan Kantri”, Nakikus carried the soul of Papua New Guinea in every chord.
He stood proudly at the crossroads of tradition and change—turning pain into poetry, and rhythm into revolution.
His passing has prompted tributes from across the country, including his nephew and award-winning artist Anslom, who described him as a “musical pillar.”
Late Matalau's close friend and pioneer Barike band member Donald Lessy, when spoken by this newsroom yesterday, was lost for words and could only reply, ""I am lost and can't accept this news"".
""Matalau and I through music and Barike became so close even travelled everywhere and internationally.
""He was part of the production of the Wan Kantri song...he didn't actually write the song, but it was his tune we used for Wan Kantri,"" recalls Lessy.
A teacher. A lawyer. A cultural warrior. A proud Tolai son—Matalau Nakikus’s legacy lives on in every PNG artist who dares to blend the old with the new.
Though his voice has fallen silent, his songs will never fade.
He gave us rhythm.
He gave us pride.
He gave us Wan Kantri."
"Muruks and Lahanis players, officials charged",15/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5238,"PRK Mendi Muruks and Bintangor Goroka Lahanis have both been handed down with harsher penalties by the PNG Rugby Football League for an on-field brawl over the weekend in Lae.
The brawl between the players and the officials of both teams went viral on social media in the last 72 hours.
Nine players face a ban of up to 53 weeks, and three team officials face a 12-month suspension. Both teams will also pay a fine of K25,000 each.
This was the decision revealed by the PNG Rugby Football League Pathways and performance general manager, Tony Archer.
Both teams have been ordered to pay a fine of K25,000 each.
Archer said, ""It's with great disappointment for our game, it's disappointing, for the people involved, it's very disappointing, but you can be assured that the actions of the PNGRLC have been strong and quick.”
""The clubs (Muruks and Lahanis) have been very supportive as we investigated this matter in the last 48 hours. I give them thanks and credit for what they have been involved in.
""This afternoon, each of those clubs has been made aware of what we are about to do. Nine players will be charged with the incident from both clubs. They will face penalties of 53 weeks. There will be three officials; the minimum suspension we are seeking for them is 12 months. One of those will be for 18 months as a repeat offender. Both clubs will be fined K25,000, and the importance of that is that our game cannot accept this behaviour.""
Archer said the PNGRFL has thoroughly reviewed the video footage of the incident, which brought the game into disrepute, and is satisfied with the penalties.
He said these penalties can serve as a reminder to the rest of the players in the competition.
He added that both rugby league clubs have been made aware of the decision.  Both teams have been ordered to pay a fine of K25,000 each. He said the penalty is handed down for bringing the game into disrepute."
Suspect in officer’s brutal killing in custody,15/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5236,"A suspect involved in the brutal killing of a police reservist in Finschhafen was brought into Lae yesterday by Morobe police.
The young police reservist, from Finschhafen, succumbed to his injury early this month when he was slashed on the head by another local man in the district.
The deceased was one of the first batch of enthusiastic officers that had graduated under the Morobe reserve police program in 2021.
While police are establishing facts into the incident, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) for Northern Command, Peter Guiness, said they believe the suspect is a person with a substance use disorder.
“The suspect was picked up and brought in yesterday along with other murder suspects in other cases in Finschhafen,” ACP Guinness said.
“They are now in custody.
“I will be following up with the Provincial Police Commander to check. At the moment, they are too busy; they’re engaged in the Kabwum by-election.”
The deceased was a young constable who was one of the 100 police reservists who had passed out from the Gusap Regional Training Centre in Madang Province, in 2021. This was under a partnership between the Morobe Provincial Government and Royal PNG Constabulary, during the term of former governor, Ginson Saonu.
The aim of the reservist program was to boost police presence in Morobe’s rural districts; hence reservists were sent to their respective electorates after concluding their training.
The reason behind his killing is yet to be determined, with ACP Guinness saying his body will be brought to Lae as well.
“Post-mortem will be conducted here in Lae and eventually, after the post-mortem is done, the body will be repatriated to his village in Finschhafen for burial.”
ACP Guinness said the suspect will be charged with wilful murder."
New autonomy committee in ENB,15/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5233,"A new Autonomy Advisory Committee for East New Britain Province was sworn in yesterday (July 14) in Kokopo by the provincial legal officer.
Comprising nine members and chaired by former politician, Sir Leo Dion, the new committee replaces the last committee that was headed by another former senior statesman, the late Sir Sinai Brown.
The new ENB Autonomy Advisory Committee comprises of;
•	Chairman – Chief Leo Dion
•	Ex-Officio – Marakan Uvano (Deputy PA for Socio-Economic Sector)
•	Kokopo representative – Dr. Livingston Tavul
•	Rabaul representative – Nelson Kiene
•	Gazelle representative – Joe Endo
•	Pomio representative – Patrick Kaupun
•	Baining representative – Chief James Tapele
•	NGO representative – Patrick Varagat
•	Women’s representative – Fidelma Kinakap
ENB Provincial Administrator Levi Mano said the previous committee’s term had also expired and new members were appointed last year, but they could not be sworn in, given it was approaching the end of the year.
Hence, the swearing-in program was deferred to this year, but unfortunately, the former chairman, Sir Sinai, also passed away in late March.
He said that while a lot of groundwork has been done by the previous committees, this new committee should progress on what East New Britain needs in its pursuit of autonomous or more decentralised powers from the national government.
“We were also fortunate to have Sir John Kaputin here in the province to give an insight on how we see autonomy, from both a development and legal point of view,” he said.
Also present at the ceremony was the ENB Provincial Member, Michael Marum, who acknowledged the efforts and leadership of the former committee members and chairpersons over the years.
He further applauded the political leadership that pursued the autonomy request by the provincial government, in the likes of former governor Chief Leo Dion, who is now the committee’s chairman.
“I want to also thank Prime Minister James Marape for his support. He has assured me personally of his government’s stand on East New Britain’s autonomy agenda,” Marum outlined.
Newly sworn in committee chairman, Chief Leo Dion, said autonomy is the right for the province to manage its affairs, as well as taking charge of the type of development that is meaningful to the province.
Chief Leo emphasised that true autonomy thrives where there is unity.
“Whether you are Tolai, Baining, Pomio, Sulka or visitor who has made this land your home, this province belongs to all of us. Our diversity is our strength, and our differences are threads in the beautiful bilum of East New Britain,” he stated.
“Let us carry the hopes of our ancestors and the dreams of our children in our hearts.”"
HIV infection rates rapidly increasing,15/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5231,"HIV infection rates in Papua New Guinea have sharply increased in 2025, with new infections doubling since 2010.
Recent data by the UNAIDS shows that about 30 new HIV infections occur daily, totaling approximately 11,000 new cases in 2024 alone.
Nearly half of these new infections are among children and young people aged 24 and below, highlighting a growing impact on younger populations.
A critical concern is the high rate of mother-to-child transmission, with an estimated 2,700 infants newly infected in 2024 due to many mothers being unaware of their HIV status and thus not receiving antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
This situation has led the government to declare a national HIV crisis in June 2025.
“The rise in new HIV infections in PNG is deeply concerning. As such, I am declaring this a National HIV crisis,” said Minister for Health Elias Kapavore.
“HIV is a disease of inequality. We need to support and empower those most impacted. It is time for all of us to step up. I commit to raising this issue with my fellow ministers and parliamentarians and ensuring the urgent allocation of resources to protect our people, especially the next generation of Papua New Guineans.”
These trends indicate a worsening epidemic that requires urgent scale-up of HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services, especially targeting mothers, children, and adolescents.
As of 2025, the global number of people living with HIV is estimated at around 40.8 million, including about 2.42 million children and adolescents under 19 years old.
In 2024 alone, approximately 1.3 million people were newly infected with HIV worldwide.
Regionally, Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most affected, with countries like South Africa having about 9.4 million HIV-positive people and an adult prevalence rate of 14.4% in 2025.
Other countries with high adult prevalence rates include Eswatini (28.3%), Lesotho (26.2%), Botswana (22.8%), and Zimbabwe (22.1%).
Globally, despite progress, challenges remain with approximately 712 children infected daily and 250 children dying from AIDS-related causes in 2024. The global target for 2025 is to reduce AIDS-related deaths to fewer than 250,000 annually."
PNG push for full membership in ASEAN,15/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5228,"Minister for Foreign Affairs Justin Tkatchenko has reiterated PNG’s aspiration to transition from ASEAN Special Observer to full membership, underscoring the strategic and economic value PNG offers to the region.
Tkatchenko, during the 32nd ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Kuala Lumpur on July 11, 2025 said Papua New Guinea’s inclusion would enhance ASEAN’s influence in the Indo-Pacific, particularly amid growing geopolitical tensions and cross-border security challenges.
Minister Tkatchenko emphasized PNG’s readiness to contribute to ASEAN. He highlighted PNG’s potential to strengthen ASEAN–Pacific economic connectivity and people-to-people exchanges.
“PNG’s inclusion would give ASEAN an economic foothold in the Pacific and unlock trade and investment opportunities,” the Minister noted, referencing PNG’s abundant natural resources, including major LNG and crude oil exports, a 2.4 million km² EEZ, and globally significant biodiversity.
He further remarked: “The recent imposition of tariffs by major powers has impacted ASEAN’s economic security. PNG’s vast resource base can offer the bloc a reliable partner for diversification and growth.”
Although PNG has not yet submitted a formal application for full membership, the Department of Foreign Affairs will now prepare a Cabinet Policy Submission for consideration by the National Executive Council.
PNG has maintained ASEAN Special Observer status since 1976 and is a permanent member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the largest Asia-Pacific political and security forum comprising ASEAN’s 10 member states, 10 Dialogue Partners, and 7 Observers.
PNG has established full diplomatic missions in four ASEAN countries, with a fifth mission to open in Thailand later this year— fulfilling ASEAN’s membership expectations.
Tkatchenko said Papua New Guinea respects the ASEAN process and stands ready to commit fully to its obligations, initiatives, and agreements.
“We offer strategic geography, surplus resources, and steadfast commitment to peace and regional cooperation.”
This renewed bid marks a pivotal step in PNG’s 49-year engagement with ASEAN and its continued role as a bridge between Asia and the Pacific. PNG has participated as an ASEAN Special Observer since 1976 and a permanent ASEAN Regional Forum member since 1994."

Volunteer promotes conservation of ‘Oro Butterfly’,14/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5220,"Found only in Northern province, the Queen Alexandra Birdwing butterfly (Ornithoptera alexandrae) is as rare as it is breathtaking.
With wings stretching nearly a foot wide, this beautiful species is in serious trouble, facing habitat destruction and illegal trade.
To mitigate this, Ahi, a volunteer attached to the National Volunteer Service (NVS), is on a journey to accelerate its conservation at the global stage.
“The Queen Alexandra Birdwing Butterfly is the largest species of butterfly in the world and it is only found in Papua New Guinea. I fear we may lose this national treasure in the next decade if we do not take good care of it,” says Ahi.
Through his Dun Eco-Tourism Project submission, he has been shortlisted as one of the top 10 finalists in the ClimateLaunchpad National competition amongst nine other inspiring Papua New Guineans with their climate-focused ideas.
Ahi entered the competition specifically focused on conserving the Queen Alexandra's Birdwing butterfly through securing a partnership and is one of 10 finalists who were selected out of 100-plus candidates around the country.
“My mission is to raise awareness on the Queen Alexandra Birdwing Butterfly and PNG’s unique biodiversity, build networks and meaningful partnerships with like-minded people and promote volunteerism at the Global stage,” he said.
Ahi said that habitat loss due to deforestation and agriculture, illegal collection, and climate change has pushed the species towards an uncertain future.
Ahi was initially assigned to the Dun Eco-Tourism project in Yoivi village in Ward 1 of the Afore LLG in the Ijivitari District of Oro by NVS in 2023.
His task was to rehabilitate and foster the growth of eco-tourism in the area and to promote the conservation of the Queen Alexander Birdwing Butterfly.
He has since been passionately working towards safeguarding the species by building a nursery to breed this butterfly and a conservation site where tourists and others can go to see this butterfly.
Ahi has also built a one-kilometer road with the help of the community to link this remote site to the main highway so that more people are made aware and protect the butterfly.
“This competition might seem like a routine event to many, but for me and the 2,000-plus people of Yoivi village, it means everything as it represents hope, visibility, and a long-awaited chance to tell our story of preserving the Oro butterfly on a global platform,” he said.
In addition, Ahi said that there has also been an increase in illegal butterfly collectors in the province who are eager to claim a specimen for export making it dangerous for the species to thrive and calls on the relevant authorities to look into this so the species is protected for future generations.
The National Competition grand finale, organised by the Em Stret Space will be in August and will see three finalists out of the 10 to represent Papua New Guinea in the ClimateLaunchpad’s Global Grand Final event in Vienna, Austria.
The passionate volunteer at the helm of this crucial attempt at preserving the largest butterfly in the world says that he is confident that the Oro Butterfly just might get the future it deserves."

Gov’t commits to achieving balanced national budget by 2027,14/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5211,"Prime Minister James Marape has reiterated the government’s firm commitment to achieving a balanced national budget by 2027.
Marape made this known when meeting with senior executives of the IMF at the IMF headquarters in Washington DC, USA, recently.
He said that from 2028, PNG will embark on an aggressive debt repayment path, anchored by the implementation of the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which is expected to be fully operational by that time.
“If we stick to our fiscal consolidation path, eliminate wastage, and grow our revenue base, we will be in a position to repay our debts and reduce our debt-to-GDP ratio to sustainable levels—targeting 30 percent or lower,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
He highlighted that by 2033, the government aims to eliminate all public debt accumulated since Independence in 1975, marking a historic milestone for the country.
According to IMF projections shared during the meeting, Papua New Guinea’s economy is expected to grow by 4.7 percent in 2025, a rate higher than the global average (3.7 percent) and outperforming the majority of Pacific Island Forum and ASEAN economies.
The IMF attributed this growth to prudent fiscal management, the recovery of non-resource sectors, and consistent reform momentum.
Prime Minister Marape noted that the country has experienced four consecutive years of non-resource sector growth—driven by agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and small-scale enterprise—proving that the economy is beginning to diversify beyond extractive industries.
“For the first time in our post-Independence history, we are seeing consistent growth from sectors that benefit our rural population. This is no accident—it is the result of targeted investment and reform,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister also pitched new areas of IMF technical assistance, including support for:
-	Establishing AI-driven digital platforms for public procurement and public service recruitment, aimed at strengthening transparency and merit-based selection;
-	Expanding renewable energy generation through hydro, geothermal and solar technologies;
-	Utilising domestically available natural gas to power island provinces and supply neighbouring Pacific nations;
-	Strengthening the country’s capacity to manage its Sovereign Wealth Fund transparently and effectively.
“These initiatives will not only help us modernise government, but also attract private investment and ensure efficient delivery of public services,” he said."

WNBPG Renews Health Commitment,12/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5197,"The West New Britain Provincial Government has reaffirmed its commitment to delivering quality healthcare to its rural population with a financial boost to one of its key health partners.
This week, Governor Sasindran Muthuvel presented a K200,000 grant to Australian Doctors International (ADI) during a ceremony in Kimbe, underscoring a continued partnership that began in 2019.
The funding, drawn from the Provincial Services Improvement Program (PSIP), will support ADI’s mobile outreach patrols and training of frontline health workers.
“On behalf of WNBPG, it’s our pleasure to present this K200,000 cheque to support their activities in going to rural areas in treating our people and bringing this health service to our people,” said Governor Muthuvel. “We will continue to partner with them going forward to bring much-needed health services to our rural area.”
Last year, ADI’s outreach clinics covered over 155 days in Talasea and Kandrian-Gloucester, reaching more than 20,000 people. The funding will also enhance training programs for community health workers and nurses.
Melis Paita of the WNB Provincial Health Authority (PHA) welcomed the support, stating, “We are pleased that most of our mothers and children are being taken care of and we will make sure that acquittals are provided on time.”
ADI representative Elizabeth Mesa highlighted the importance of joint planning and implementation:
“It will allow us to provide additional trainings to our frontline health workers. Our work is not done in isolation – it’s done shoulder to shoulder with local help, staff, community leaders and the PHA.”
The tripartite collaboration between WNBPG, ADI, and the PHA continues to strengthen rural health service delivery and community well-being."
Menyamya’s five brave students,12/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5195,"Five students from Morobe’s rural Menyamya Secondary School bravely held their heads up as they marched alongside 13 other high and secondary schools into the Lae Showgrounds on Thursday.
Fourteen marching groups – representing the 14 participating schools – paraded into the Lae Showgrounds on the day to officially open the 2025 Morobe Inter-school Exhibition.
While 13 of the schools had nearly 20 or more students marching proudly with their well-designed banners and marching attires, Morobe’s rural Menyamya Secondary School only had five students – three male and two female students.
Dressed in their green and black uniforms, it was obvious that the group was hastily put together for the morning parade.
Grade 12 line 1 student, Brenden Gipion, found himself pushed to the front when their teachers decided to put all their efforts on the science display.
While he was disappointed with not only his teachers but their student leaders as well, he decided to lead the small group of marchers into the arena, hastily instructing them on simple patterns while marching.
Fellow marcher, Grade 10 student, Jodie Johnamjie, who is part Central and Menyamya, burst into tears as she told of how they had travelled for six hours to finally reach their host school, Busu secondary, at 4am.
After only a few hours of rest, they had to get ready and move to the Lae Showgrounds for the parade then exhibition.
“Because of the delay by the vehicle, the students who are supposed to march to open the exhibition are still on their way,” she said.
“The teachers asked some of the students to participate in marching and for some of us, we didn’t even practice marching and everything but they picked 10 of us but the students did not want to participate and they just left.
“For five of us, we would love to leave because last night, we did not have a good night’s rest because we were traveling till morning. And now we are down here and because of our school’s name, we had to stay here without eating properly,” she sobbed.
“It really helps a lot to see Menyamya secondary taking part in marching. For us students, we are happy because we would love to see our school’s name on the list also.
“We will do anything for our school, even if we are tired or hungry, even we are stressed out but, we still have to do it because of our school.”
Twelve teachers had reportedly travelled down with the first group of Menyamya Secondary School students.
The students rarely travel down to Lae city, and though they were sorely disappointed – and even entertained the thought of returning home immediately, Jodie, said they will use this experience as a stepping stone."

“A disciplined approach to physical fitness benefits our members professionally and personally.
“New standards for physical fitness will be introduced that will set levels required for our police to meet.
“Personnel that are part of the Kumul23 tactical group must attain a peak standard of physical fitness and mental agility.
“Kumul23 sets a high level and this is a very good example for other police around the nation to aspire to in their jobs.”"

Prime Minister James Marape announced this following his meeting with Landau on Wednesday, July 10th 2025.
The Prime Minister also met with the Vice President of the United States on Thursday, July 11th at the White House where the Vice President confirmed USA’s attendance to the 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations.
Prime Minister Marape’s meeting with US government officials has strengthened strategic ties between Papua New Guinea and the United States across trade, investments, security, and fisheries cooperation.
His engagements included high-level discussions at the Pentagon, U.S. Border Protection, and the U.S. Coast Guard, meeting with the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, Christopher Landau and meeting with the Vice President.
Prime Minister Marape described these discussions as highly productive.
The Prime Minister also welcomed the continued presence of major American companies in PNG — Newmont, ExxonMobil, and Hilton — and encouraged further U.S. investment in fisheries, energy, hospitality, and manufacturing.
He specifically advocated for U.S. involvement in the fisheries sector, including through regional partnerships facilitated by the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and the East New Britain Initiative, which offers land for joint Pacific fisheries ventures.
On deep sea mining, Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed PNG’s national moratorium on this sector, highlighting the importance of the waters as breeding grounds for marine life.
In the area of defence cooperation and maritime security, the Prime Minister acknowledged the growing benefits of the existing Defence Cooperation Agreement.
He said defence cooperation is not only strengthening the military’s capacity but also improving operational readiness, infrastructure, and surveillance across the board, noting an increase in military-to-military exchanges, joint operations, and training initiatives under the agreement.
Discussions with the U.S. Coast Guard and Pentagon officials focused on enhancing joint maritime patrols to counter illegal fishing, transnational crime, and illicit trade — including unauthorised shipments of arms, drugs, and other contraband."
Promoting inclusive workplaces in PNG,12/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5192,"The Australian Government, through the Papua New Guinea-Australia Partnership, has launched EmployAbility – a groundbreaking initiative aimed at creating more inclusive workplaces and supporting people living with disabilities to enter the job market in PNG.
The initiative was officially launched on 11 July 2025 by representatives from the Australian High Commission, PNG Assembly of Disabled Persons, and the Business Council of PNG.
“With the launch of this project, the Australian Government has taken a step forward to support people with disability. For most of us that come from the Australian Awards Scholarships, we have had an issue with finding inclusive workspaces, now this project, we see that it's a dream come true for people with disability,” said Ruth Javati, Vice President, PNG Assembly of Disabled Persons.
The initiative will be delivered in collaboration with the PNG Assembly of Disabled Persons, the Business Council of PNG, and the Lae Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
EmployAbility will address the significant underrepresentation of people living with disabilities in PNG’s workforce. The initiative will develop and rollout an EmployAbility Toolkit which draws on real-life PNG case studies to provide businesses with practical advice on accommodating and empowering people living with disabilities as employees and customers.
It will also deliver work-readiness training, placement opportunities, and networking events designed to connect people with disabilities directly with employers — challenging bias and creating real employment pathways.
Ms Carmella Gabina, Executive Director, Business Council of PNG, said: “We believe in promoting inclusivity in the workplace is essential. For a strong and more vibrant community, we need to build workplaces where everyone can contribute their skills and ideas. This benefits not only businesses but also helps to create a fairer and more equal society.”
Also in attendance was Australian High Commission representative, Sinead Mulders-Jones.
“Many people living with disabilities face barriers to economic participation, including lack of accessibility and inclusive hiring practices. Employability aims to support PNG businesses create inclusive and more accessible workplaces for people living with disabilities in PNG,” she said.
Inclusive development is a shared priority for both the Australian and Papua New Guinean governments. EmployAbility represents a step forward in ensuring that people living with disabilities have equal access to employment opportunities and can contribute meaningfully to PNG’s economic growth."
Barras Trials Heat Up,11/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5189,"Papua New Guinea’s top cricketers went head-to-head at Amini Park yesterday in a crucial 50-over trial match, as selectors prepare to name the final 14-man squad for two major international tournaments later this year.
The match, held under clear skies in Port Moresby, brought together the 25-member Barramundis train-on squad, who have spent the past two months in intense preparation for the 2025 ODI tournament in Jersey and the ICC T20 World Cup Qualifiers in Oman.
Chairman of the National Selection Panel, Hudson Api Leka, described the match as “compelling” and praised the high level of competition between veterans and new talent.
“New and vibrant players challenged the old guard, proving that every position in the squad is up for grabs,” said Leka. “This is exactly what we want—it keeps everyone sharp and ensures only the best wear the national colours.”
The squad will next be trimmed to 20 contracted players before selectors finalize the 14 who will represent PNG in the two global tournaments and form the backbone of the national team going forward.
National Assistant Coach John Ovia credited much of the team’s progress to international coaching input, particularly from former Australian national coach Tim Nielsen.
“Tim has been instrumental in sharpening our batting and bowling techniques,” Ovia said. “Combined with support from international fielding coaches, our players have responded well, and the improvement is visible.”
The squad features a mix of experienced Barramundis—such as captain Assad Vala, Sese Bau, Kabua Morea, and Alei Nao—and promising new additions, including Under-19 Garamuts who recently competed at the U19 World Cup Qualifiers in Japan.
“It’s encouraging to see senior players mentoring the younger ones. That bond is shaping a resilient and united squad,” Ovia added.
He also acknowledged Cricket PNG’s support for providing resources, uniforms, and logistical backing, helping the players focus solely on performance.
With selectors now reviewing player data and performances from today’s match, the final squad is expected to be announced in the coming days.
As PNG’s cricket community awaits the announcement, one thing is clear:
competition is fierce, preparations are strong, and the Barramundis are determined to make their mark on the global stage.
“This is a defining moment for PNG Cricket,” Leka concluded. “Let’s continue to back our players as they fight for every opportunity and aim to bring pride to our country.”"
Jiwaka police report two deaths after SOO 3,11/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5187,"State of Origin Game 3 in Jiwaka Province was marred with violence as police reported two deaths, believed to be from the aftermath of the State of Origin decider yesterday.
An elderly man from Hela Province was burnt alive during a tribal fight between two ethnic groups in Jiwaka on Thursday morning.
Jiwaka Provincial Police Commander Chief Inspector Laimo Asi confirmed that the deceased, identified as Agiru Koroba from Koroba in Hela Province, was sleeping in his house when people from Hela, who reside at the settlement near the WRC estate, burned down more than 20 houses in the estate on Thursday morning, one of which had the old man inside.
Another 30-year-old man from the Kuta Kopi Tribe of Hagen Central also died as a result of a fight that occurred at different locations within the estate early Thursday morning.

""The situation was very tense, but a quick response from the police brought the situation under control. One of the main suspects from Hela, who is now admitted to the hospital, is under close supervision from the police. Those who lost their houses were advised not to take the law into their own hands but to assist the police with information on how it happened that led to the death of the old man and the burning of the houses,"" PPC Asi said.
PPC Asi was at the scene yesterday morning, addressing the people there.

PNGDF launch 50th walk,11/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5186,"To begin its celebration of Papua New Guinea's 50th Independence Anniversary, the PNG Defence Force (PNGDF) will stage Exercise Antap Long Ol, beginning in the second week of July and leading into the PNGDF Week in September.
This will involve PNGDF land element units of the army participating in a walk, traversing the country from its mainland's northern seaboard to its southern seaboard. It will begin at the 2nd Battalion Royal Pacific Island Regiment base in Moem and conclude in Waigani, Port Moresby.
East Sepik Deputy Governor David Kausik officially launched the program on Wednesday, July 09th at Moem Barracks.
This activity will retrace the steps of 2nd Battalion Pacific Island Regiment soldiers in 1975 who undertook the first Exercise Antap Long Ol when then Lieutenant Geoff Key led a patrol of 16 men across 1,200 kilometres from Moem to Port Moresby, and delivered two letters of greetings to then Chief Minister Michael Somare and then Minister for Defence, Foreign Relations and Trade Albert Maori Kiki.
Therefore, in the next two months, soldiers will walk over 1200km from the North to the South of mainland PNG. Soldiers in Wewak will walk to Madang and hand over to soldiers in Lae, who will walk to Markham Bridge and hand over to our Port Moresby and Central Province-based units to cross over the mountain ranges between Morobe, Gulf, and Central to reach Port Moresby.
Chief of Defence Force Rear Admiral Philip Polewara said it will be a difficult and treacherous walk. The soldiers will cross two of our largest rivers - the Sepik River and the Ramu River – and cross large plains in the Sepik, Ramu, and Markham, and they will go over the dangerous Ekuti Dividing Range to reach the Gulf and NCD.
“It will be a challenging activity, a test of character, endurance, and resilience, but the men and women of the PNGDF will complete this exercise,” Polewara said.
Kausik said the walk signifies the PNGDF's readiness to showcase the resilience, strength, determination, and bravery of the force 50 years on in safeguarding the people of PNG."
NAC announces airport capacity for A220s,11/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5185,"With the arrival of the first of All Air Niugini's new Airbus A220 fleet in September 2025, the National Airports Corporation (NAC) advises that five out of its 13 designated jet airports are currently capable of supporting the regular unrestricted operations of the new A220 and the B737 aircraft. The Albus (Airbus) A220, which has a maximum take-off weight of up to 70 tonnes, requires a runway length of approximately 1800 to 2500 metres for take-off at maximum weight, depending on altitude and weather conditions.
The airports that can accommodate the A220 when it commences operations are those with asphalt concrete surfaces. They are, Port Moresby, Nadzab, Kavieng, Momote, and Gurney.
Passenger safety
According to NAC Acting Managing Director/CEO Dominic Kaumu, the reasons precluding the operations of the A220 and the B737 into the above eight airports, include safety perspective, given that these aircraft have low slung engine under the wings and there is a high risk that the engines can easily ingest loose sealing chips from bituminous spray sealed surface and damage the jet engines.
Kaumu said the other reason is that the Fokker 100, the current operating aircraft, has a maximum take-off weight of 44 tonnes, and the bituminous spray-sealed surface has been holding up to its operations. On the other hand, the A220 with a maximum take-off weight of 70 tonnes, which is an additional 30 tonnes pressed on the pavement and with the aircraft maneuvering on its bituminous spray seated surface can cause the pavement protective seal to break exposing the pavement to nature and undermine the pavement integrity hence accelerate the rate of pavement deterioration.
He said for the safety of the aircraft and the passengers, it is essential that the runways be surfaced with asphalt concrete as opposed to the bitumirious spray sealed surface of the above airports. The asphalt concrete overlay on our runway pavements will also extend the life of the pavement by an additional 15 to 20 years, resulting in lesser cyclic maintenance costs for the runways, as the most important asset at any airport.
Asphalt concrete surfacing
Other jet airports will not accommodate the A220 in 2025 until their aircraft pavements are surfaced with asphalt concrete. These airports are Mt. Hagen, Tokua, Vanimo, Buka, Goroka, Hoskins, Wewak and Madang.
The A220 and the 8737 cannot operate into Mt. Hagen and Tokua airports until the asphalt concrete surfacing is placed at the former and a second layer of asphalt concrete is placed at the latter. A second wearing course of asphalt concrete must be placed at Tokua airport as a medium-term arrangement whilst the NAC gets a major upgrade of the aircraft pavement under the Civil Aviation Development Program (CADIP) 3, which is anticipated to commence in 2028.
Mt Hagen and Tokua airports need K40million each to lay the asphalt concrete to enable operations of the A220 and 8737. Tender for the work at Mt. Hagen has been completed and is awaiting funding of K40million to implement. Mr Kaumu said NAC is ready to call for tender for the second layer of the asphalt concrete at Takua but is again subject to the availability of another K40million funding.
The NAC boss said it is important to note that preparedness of airport operations for a major re-fleeting program, such as the new Airbus A220, requires early engagement with all key stakeholders to ensure that airport capacity, regulatory compliance are ensured and infrastructure compatibility are aligned with the aircraft's performance, safety requirements, and schedules."
Minister upset over students' inappropriate behaviour,11/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5184,"The Minister for Education, Lucas Dekena has condemned the inappropriate and culturally insensitive activities recently displayed by students of Gerehu Secondary School during their Mufti Day program held on Friday July 4, 2025.
The program, organised by the Student Representative Council (SRC) and supported by the school administration, was held under the theme PNG@50: Honouring Our Pacific Heritage, inspiring Modern Careers, and Celebrating Sports Outfits Innovation.
Minister Dekena said while we recognise that schools often host programs to help students showcase various professions and aspects of our culture, there must be clear limits, including respecting the norms, values, and expectations of our communities.
Dekena said what unfolded during the school’s Mufti Day program was well beyond what is acceptable. Images of what the minister described as inappropriate behaviour, was circulated on social media stirring negative comment from members of the public. The minister said this behaviour reflects very poorly on the school, its administration, and the education system as a whole.
“School principals should be very sensitive to any activity that students are going to take part in, activities that will promote negative perceptions, or incite trouble.”
“Even if teachers believe these activities are part of educational programs, principals and administrators must ensure that students do not cross boundaries that could incite unethical conduct or damage the reputation of the school.”
“The principal and school administration have already provided a full explanation on what has transpired. Their performance will be reviewed, and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken where necessary.”
“Going forward, I urge all school principals and administrators to exercise greater care and sensitivity when it comes to activities as such. Any activities that might promote negative perceptions or offend cultural and community standards must not be allowed in our schools.”
“Our schools must always uphold the highest moral and ethical standards. This is essential to (protecting) the image of our institutions and to safeguard the future of our young people,” the Minister added."
Manning calls for immediate intervention in Hela,11/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5182,"Commissioner of Police, David Manning, has expressed outrage at recent instances of violence against women in Hela Province and has directed immediate police intervention to protect vulnerable communities.
""These disgusting crimes against women and children have shocked the nation,"" Commissioner Manning said.
""These are not the actions of Papua New Guineans; these are the actions of animals.
""Murder, rape, and torture will not be accepted as 'cultural beliefs.' These are crimes, plain and simple.
""The notion of 'sanguma' was not known to our nation 50 years ago, and it will not be accepted today. Nonsense excuses for crimes must end.
""With immediate effect, I have directed Deputy Commissioner for Regional Operations, Samson Kua to establish a police intervention and personally oversee operations in Hela province.
""DCP Kua's directions are to restore order, dismantle groups that perpetuate so-called 'cultural beliefs' that fuel misery and death, and ensure swift justice for offenders.""
In confirming the implementation of a targeted intervention, Commissioner Manning noted that communities must do more to protect the vulnerable.
""Lasting change requires community action. Elders and leaders must step in—not stand by—when their own are being brutalized. It's time to intervene, support police, and protect our people.
""Standing around recording violence on phones and posting it online is cowardice. Leadership means stepping up to stop it.
""With the support of the government, this intervention will clamp down hard on violent offenders. The women and children of Hela deserve safety, dignity, and justice, and this police intervention will deliver.""
Commissioner Manning called on all government agencies to support the intervention, highlighting that protecting the vulnerable is a societal responsibility.
""The situation in Hela is an emergency and immediate action is required. I have committed the resources of the RPNGC to support DCP Kua end this lawlessness, and I expect all Government agencies to step up to end this cycle of violence against the most vulnerable,"" Manning added"

"EU, PNG reinforce partnership with new investments",10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5178,"The European Union (EU) and Papua New Guinea (PNG) have deepened their partnership, advancing new investment projects in water and the Rabaul port infrastructure under the EU’s Global Gateway strategy and Team Europe initiatives. This progress was achieved during a high-level visit to PNG between 8 and 10 July that took place in a Team Europe format: bringing together the representatives of the EU, its lending arm, the European Investment Bank (EIB), and the French development agency (AFD).
European Commissioner for International Partnerships Jozef Síkela said, “From transforming the Rabaul port into Papua New Guinea’s first green port to improving access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene, the partnership between the European Union and Papua New Guinea is delivering real impact — boosting trade, jobs, health, and climate resilience. These flagship initiatives reflect the EU’s Global Gateway investment strategy in action, driving sustainable economic growth and improving lives for communities in the country. I look forward to my visit to the Pacific region in September to strengthen our mutual cooperation.”
“We are proud to support the Government of Papua New Guinea and work alongside our European partners to deliver sustainable infrastructure that makes a real difference to people’s lives. Whether it is building rural bridges, modernising ports, or improving access to clean water, these are the kinds of projects the European Investment Bank is committed to under the Global Gateway. We value our cooperation with Papua New Guinea and look forward to continuing to invest in a greener, more resilient future for the country,” said Ambroise Fayolle, EIB Vice President.
The two key initiatives in PNG are the modernisation and greening of the Rabaul Port.
On Wednesday 9 July 2025, PNG Ports Corporation Limited (PNG Ports), AFD, EIB and the EU discussed the status of the project that seeks to upgrade and green the Rabaul Port. The project highlights the strong European commitment to modernising PNG’s port infrastructure to meet growing trade demands and address environmental challenges. The project is part of Global Gateway to support the development of sustainable quality infrastructure (energy transition, waste management, climate and disaster proofing). It is delivered in a Team Europe approach, bringing together the EU, AFD and EIB.
“PNG Ports is committed to upgrade its port facilities to be fit for purpose, sustainable and climate and disaster resilient, and this support and collaboration with AFD, EU, and EIB will greatly assist in realising this,” said Mr Papenfus.
In addition, he mentioned the project being aligned with the PNG Government’s push for the implementation of green initiatives and more resilience to the global effects of climate change at the ports.
EU Ambassador, Jacques Fradin said, “The Rabaul Port Rehabilitation Project, with an EU grant of EUR 16.6 million, is the first action in PNG where an EU grant is combined with EU guaranteed loans provided by our European partners AFD and EIB, in order to advance the EU Global Gateway Strategy in PNG and the Pacific.”
Furthermore, on Tuesday 8 July 2025, the national government and the EU signed an agreement for a new EUR 3 million project. It will provide capacity building and support to Water PNG Limited to improve access to safe, reliable water and reduce water loss for communities. This agreement is an addition to a wider cooperation package totaling EUR 39.7 million between the Government, the EU and EIB.
The project will help Water PNG deliver safe, affordable, and sustainable water services in Namatanai (New Ireland Province), Kupiano (Central Province), Misima (Milne Bay Province), and Kurumul (Jiwaka Province), while also supporting water loss reduction in selected areas of Port Moresby.  The signing took place in Port Moresby and was witnessed by Heads of relevant national and provincial government agencies, as well as Heads of missions and development partners.

Colourful student parade opens exhibition,10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5175,"In Lae, it’s not an event worth mentioning if the iconic Bugandi brass band is not performing.
Under clear skies, neatly dressed students from 14 different high and secondary schools in Morobe proudly flew their banners as they marched in time to the beating drums of Bugandi’s brass band.
The schools around Lae city, Huon Gulf district, Bulolo and even rural Menyamya – with only five students representing the latter – paraded into the Lae Showgrounds and demonstrated their marching patterns as their peers enthusiastically cheered them on from the side.  The parade signifies the official opening of two days of interschool exhibition under the theme: ‘Creativity, Innovation and Unity in Education in Morobe’.
“Fourteen schools, two private schools also included; AOG Christian Academy and Christian Integrated School,” outlined Busu Secondary School principal and the exhibition’s coordinator, George Noble.
“Also, our school of excellence for Morobe Province, Wawin School of Excellence.
“Compared to the previous years, the number of items has really increased; the number of schools has also increased, and number of participants has also increased. Because of that, we cannot have one stage to put everything in order. We have three different stages.”
When the exhibition was first hosted in 2019, Noble said most schools did not know what to do or what was expected of them. The second and third exhibitions were hosted in 2022 and 2023 as the COVID-19 pandemic had prevented large gatherings in 2020 and 2021.
Last year, the action committee could not host an exhibition due to funding constraints. This year, K200,000 from the Morobe Provincial Government has made the event possible, with Noble expressing his delight that this year, the marching has improved.
“More than 10,000 students and 375 teachers we are accommodating here in the main arena now,” continued Noble.
“This K200,000 – K100,000 from last year, and another K100,000 this year – put together, we organised this program.
“Compared to previous years, we gave a little bit more money as financial assistance to all the schools.
“Our dear deputy provincial administrator, Robin Bazzinuc, as we can see from the number of students, this K200,000 is not actually enough to host this program properly, including the prizes and awards. I’m kindly asking you to increase the amount to K385,000 or something.”
Noble outlined that over K380,000 is needed to achieve their goal, and that is to award the best students in physics, chemistry, biology, music and others; either through government scholarships or sending them to study abroad.
The different schools have set up their exhibitions under science and technology, tourism and hospitality, arts and culture, agriculture and herbs, and entertainment, including public speaking, music, mimicry, drama, fashion parades and tableau."
Kimbe Port Redevelopment Underway,10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5173,"The Kimbe Port Redevelopment Project in West New Britain has officially entered the mobilisation phase, with two barges carrying critical plant and equipment departing from Townsville, Australia earlier this week. The equipment, which will arrive in approximately 12 days, will enable the start of major maritime works at the port site.
The redevelopment is a key component of the Australian-funded Ports Infrastructure Investment Program (PIIP), through the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP).
The PIIP aims to upgrade five strategic ports across Papua New Guinea—Kimbe, Oro Bay, Daru, Kavieng, and Lae—to enhance trade, connectivity, and economic resilience.
Pacific Marine Group Pty Ltd (PMG) has been contracted to deliver the complex marine works under a PGK260 million contract. This includes demolishing and rebuilding the main wharf, restoring the existing wharf structure, and repairing revetment walls. Works are scheduled to conclude in 2026.
The project is expected to provide substantial economic benefits to the local community through employment, training, and subcontracting opportunities for Papua New Guinean firms.
In the coming months, local construction company Global Constructions Ltd will begin shore-based works under a separate PGK79 million contract.
The initiative arrives just ahead of PNG’s 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations in September and highlights the enduring partnership between Papua New Guinea and Australia.
It also signals a major step forward in improving the country’s maritime infrastructure and unlocking greater access to trade and development in West New Britain."
Kumul Joins Global Spotlight,10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5171,"Papua New Guinea’s iconic Raggiana bird-of-paradise, or kumul, has become the 17,000th species featured in National Geographic’s Photo Ark, a global initiative dedicated to documenting animals in human care to promote biodiversity and conservation.
This milestone was achieved during a visit to the Port Moresby Nature Park in April 2025 by National Geographic explorer and Photo Ark founder Joel Sartore. His mission is to photograph 25,000 species worldwide to inspire greater public awareness of the planet’s fragile ecosystems and the need to protect them.
“Birds-of-paradise are truly living works of art, with their stunning colors and mesmerizing behavior,” Sartore said. “We preserve art in museums — don’t these birds and the species we’ve captured deserve our protection too?”
The Photo Ark’s announcement was shared with a global audience of more than 500 million through National Geographic’s and Sartore’s social media and media channels, placing a bright spotlight on PNG’s remarkable biodiversity.
The fact that the kumul—the national symbol of Papua New Guinea—was chosen as the 17,000th species holds special significance. The milestone also aligns with the country’s 50th year of independence, adding further national pride to the achievement.
“To have our national bird recognized as the 17,000th species in this globally respected project, and during our golden jubilee year, is truly the icing on the cake,” said Johnpaul Houston, CEO of Port Moresby Nature Park. “It highlights the uniqueness of our wildlife and the importance of protecting it for future generations.”
Many of the animals photographed during Sartore’s visit had never been documented in the Photo Ark before, making PNG a major contributor to the project’s growing archive.
The photographs will be returned to the Port Moresby Nature Park later this year for public display, giving locals and tourists alike the chance to see the beauty of PNG’s wildlife through a global lens.
As forests shrink and species face growing threats from human activity, the inclusion of the kumul in this global conservation archive sends a clear message: protecting PNG’s natural heritage is more urgent than ever."

The lab, officially opened yesterday (July 9) at the school’s Mirene campus, includes 20 brand new desktop computers and a fully installed Wi-Fi and internet system, all funded and implemented by NICTA.
Highlands Regional ICT Inspector for NICTA, Antonia Karai, confirmed that while the ICT rollout has been ongoing in other regions, Simbu is now leading the way in the Highlands.
“It is a costly investment, but NICTA is committed to bridging the digital divide, especially in rural and remote tertiary institutions,” Karai said.
Principal of the Kundiawa School of Nursing, Ali Mun, expressed gratitude, noting that as a recently established institution, development milestones like this are vital.
“In today’s world, students must be digitally equipped. With NICTA’s support, we’re not just building infrastructure — we’re building opportunities,” Mun said.
The lab is in line with national education directives that all higher education institutions be ICT-enabled, ensuring students gain the necessary skills for a technology-driven workforce. The school has also undertaken other developments including new classrooms and staff housing.
With this support, the school is positioning itself not just as a centre for nursing education but also as a model for rural digital transformation."
"Simbu crackdown on cheap, harmful liquor",10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5168,"The Simbu Provincial Administration has intensified its crackdown on cheap, high-alcohol-content spirits across the province, despite lifting its liquor ban last month.
Effective June 3, 2025, the Simbu Provincial Executive Council, chaired by Noah Kool and Provincial Administrator John Punde, restructured the previous total ban by continuing to outlaw cheap spirits, especially those over 5 per cent alcohol and mostly imported from Asian markets.
“These products like Mr. Ethen, Wanbel, Dark Rum, and Coffee Punch are too strong, too cheap, and accessible to our young people,” said Acting Principal Advisor for Revenue, Wagi Kon. “They are a key cause of public disorder in our towns.”
“We are not allowing spirits like Mr. Ethen, Wanbel, Dark Rum, and others that are harmful. Our concern is the youths—these drinks are cheap, strong, and dangerous.”
Operations led by the Revenue Division began last week and is continuing this week in the urban centres before expanding to all six districts. The Liquor Division is working closely with police to ensure compliance.
Liquor Inspector, Johnny Kaupa said enforcement is strict, “Our inspections are ongoing. We are warning shop owners not to stock banned items. Penalties will apply for non-compliance.”
Only certified alcohol products such as SP Brewery beer and other legally imported beverages from Australia, New Zealand, and Europe are permitted for sale.
The province cites rising youth alcohol abuse as a leading cause of lawlessness, with many school-aged children involved in alcohol-fueled violence and disturbances.
The Simbu Administration urges parents and community leaders to support the crackdown to protect their children and restore peace in the province."
Lae team tours Australian vessel,10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5167,"A team from Lae, Morobe Province, were taken on an official tour of the Australian Defence Vessel (ADV) “Reliant”.
The Australian Consulate-General in Lae, Morobe Province, invited some of its partners aboard ADV “Reliant” yesterday (July 9) to learn of the vessel’s capabilities when it comes to assisting in disasters or humanitarian response efforts in the region.
Representatives from the Royal PNG Constabulary, PNG Fire Service, Morobe Provincial Health Authority, the provincial disaster office and church partners were welcomed on board by Navy liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Paul Newton.
Lt Commander Newton explained that ADV ‘Reliant’ is not commissioned, hence it is not part of the Navy’s active fleet. Instead, ADV ‘Reliant’ “is the Australian Government’s primary maritime humanitarian and disaster response capability”.
“We have been tasked by the Australian Government purely to provide support to south-west Pacific nations,” explained Lt Commander Newton.
“This ship is assigned for 300 days a year to support south-west Pacific taskings; the other 60 days will be spent doing maintenance.
“So, it’s a very high priority for the Australian Government to provide a persistent presence out here and importantly, the work that the ship does should be driven from our Pacific Island partners.
“So, you work very closely with Sir (Australian Consul-General Brenton Kanowski) from the post, and has the request go up and filtered down. Hopefully, when we come out, we provide direct support to what Pacific Island nations need as opposed to what we might think you might need. There’s a slight difference there.”
The vessel’s recent task was the ferrying of the historic US bomber, Hell’n Pelican II, to Port Moresby to be placed in the PNG National Museum and Art Gallery.
ADV ‘Reliant’ is currently ferrying back army vehicles and equipment used in ‘Exercise Pukpuk’ at Igam Barracks. The vessel also provides maritime surveillance, search and rescue, training, mentoring and capacity building in an effort to contribute to a collective secure region.
The auxiliary vessel has medical facilities and the ability to produce approximately 20 tonnes of potable (drinking) water per day, with storage for up to 800 tonnes of drinking water and offloading capacity of 500 tonnes per day. It has two saltwater cannons to fight fire, 60 bunks and a 1,000 square metre deck that can fit up to 500 people for a 12-hour transit.
Australian Consul in Lae, Brenton Kanowski, welcomed the ship’s arrival, outlining that its visit highlights the strength of Australia’s partnership with Papua New Guinea, and their shared commitment to regional security and resilience."
"Milestone 100th game for skipper, Ila Alu",09/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5161,"This weekend awaits a milestone for Ila Alu, the inspirational leader and captain of the PNG Hunters, as he plays his 100th game in Round 17 of the QRL Hostplus Cup.
The match against the Central Queensland Capras in Rockhampton, Queensland, promises to be an emotional and pivotal moment for Alu and the team.
At 30 years of age, Alu has already carved a legacy with the Hunters since making his debut against Northern Pride on March 17, 2018, under the guidance of foundation coach Michael Marum. Elevated from the ranks of the Rabaul Gurias, Alu's commitment has made him one of the longest-serving members of the Hunters squad.
Following last week’s impressive victory over competition leaders, Townsville Blackhawks, where the Hunters triumphed 34-16, Alu is filled with enthusiasm for this milestone game.
Expressing his excitement, Alu commented, “It’s been a journey to get to 100; it hasn’t completely sunk in yet, but it’s a privilege and an honor to play 100 games for this wonderful club.”
Despite the significance of the occasion, he emphasizes the importance of focusing on the team's preparation. “Not thinking too far ahead while all concentration is making sure all our preparation is right and the game can take care of itself.”
Having recently led his team through challenging times, including three consecutive losses, Alu commended his teammates for their resilience in securing a crucial victory against Townsville.
“Big moments like that are a testament to the hard work, commitment, and dedication of the team.” With this newfound momentum, he highlights the importance of the upcoming game in Rockhampton. “This is a very important game for us.”
In reflecting on his rugby league journey and the influences that shaped him, Alu revealed that one of his ultimate goals has always been to represent the Papua New Guinea Kumuls. This dream became a reality in 2024 when he was selected to compete in the Pacific Championships against Fiji and the Cook Islands.
“The biggest goal was to play for the Kumuls. I thank God for the privilege and honor to don the national colors last season,” he said. He also expressed gratitude to his family, his wife, mentor Nelson Stone, and everyone who contributed to his journey.
As Alu approaches his 100th game, he embodies the spirit of resilience, passion, and commitment that defines the PNG Hunters and inspires future generations of athletes."

Last week Gulf Provincial Administrator Clement Tare presented a K80,000 cheque to NCC Executive Director Steven Enomb Kilanda during a ceremony at the NCC head office in Port Moresby. This contribution marks Gulf’s commitment to the completion of the Toare Cultural Centre in Toare village.
The centre, jointly developed by NCC and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), is part of a broader strategy to nominate the unique Toare Mask Culture for UNESCO’s Urgent Safeguarding List. With this latest funding from the Gulf Provincial Government and NCC’s initial contribution of K20,000, the project is now ready for completion.
The Toare Cultural Centre will be officially opened on Friday, July 11th, 2025, with the Toare Mask Festival to follow from July 12th to 13th. The festival will celebrate local identity and serve as a platform for cultural expression, learning, and youth engagement.
NCC Executive Director, Steven Enomb Kilanda praised the initiative, describing it as a milestone in Papua New Guinea’s cultural preservation efforts. He thanked Gulf leaders for putting culture at the forefront of development.
Mr Tare reaffirmed the Gulf Provincial Government’s ongoing support for cultural programs and emphasized the importance of embedding cultural identity in youth education and community development. He said the Toare Cultural Centre would be a beacon of pride for the people of Gulf Province and a symbol of resilience and cultural revival.
“This partnership is more than funding—it is about placing value on who we are as a people,” Tare said.
The cultural partnership between Gulf Province, NCC, and UNESCO is the first of its kind in Papua New Guinea, setting a powerful precedent for other provinces to follow."
Call for tougher penalties against PMV operators,09/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5159,"NCD Governor, Powes Parkop, has condemned the mayhem and destruction caused by Public Motor Vehicle (PMV) drivers and their relatives in Port Moresby on Tuesday, July 8.
He said the actions of the individuals involved in the riot in Hanuabada have not only undermined law and order but have also tarnished the city’s image.
Governor Parkop has appealed to the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Benjamin Turi, and the Metropolitan Superintendent, Warrick Simatab, to immediately identify and arrest all PMV drivers and individuals involved in the riots, and have them charged for riotous behaviour and other relevant offences.
He also called on the Road Traffic Authority (RTA) to suspend the operating licences of all PMVs involved indefinitely, and also a review RTA’s role in managing public transport in Port Moresby.
Parkop added that the authority has failed to effectively regulate the sector.
“There is no place for such lawlessness in our capital city, especially in this day and age when we are striving to build a modern, peaceful, and progressive society.
“While I share the public’s grief and outrage over the tragic killing of a PMV crew member – a crime that must be thoroughly investigated and justice delivered – it does not in any way justify the reckless and tribal violence that followed.”
Governor Parkop said this incident that transpired at Hanuabada must be a turning point.
“We must urgently detribalise the public transport system in our city. The culture of tribal identity and revenge has no place in our public services. I call on the Minister for Transport to make the bold and necessary decisions to reform the system. We cannot allow such irresponsibility to continue unchecked,” said Parkop.
“What occurred yesterday (Tuesday) was a complete breakdown of decency and order. It must never happen again. We must act swiftly and decisively to restore confidence in public safety and to uphold the rule of law in our capital city,” added Parkop."

On 19 June 2025, IOM donated ambulances and critical health equipment to enhance emergency healthcare services at the country’s borders.
This initiative supports Papua New Guinea’s national priorities to strengthen border health security and emergency response capacity. It also reflects IOM’s ongoing commitment to building inclusive, resilient, and responsive health systems in the region and at key border points.

His Excellency, Ambassador Hisanobu Mochizuki underscored the shared vision for a resilient future. “As we mark 50 years of diplomatic relations between Japan and Papua New Guinea, this initiative reflects our shared vision of a safer, healthier, and more resilient future.”
While Mr Kato added, “Mobility and health are inextricably linked. This contribution is more than a donation – it’s a long-term investment in life-saving healthcare access, especially at ports of entry and in areas where migration and emergency response intersect.”
The support comes at a historic moment as Papua New Guinea celebrates 50 years of independence and diplomatic ties with Japan, highlighting international cooperation and shared progress.

Hanuabada situation under control,09/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5157,"Following the incident at Hanuabada village on Tuesday, July 8, normalcy has been restored.
However, PMV operators have ceased operations within the area, following the stabbing of a PMV driver. They have demanded for the apprehension of the suspect, before any bus service can continue.
According to police report, the incident began when a PMV bus driver was stabbed in the eye by a youth from Tatana village, following a verbal altercation over a parking space at the Hanuabada bypass bus stop.
This incident led to a disruption of public transport services as other PMV bus drivers, feeling aggrieved, took matters into their own hands. They mobilized and confronted residents of Hanuabada village, and also intimidated other law-abiding PMV drivers, forcing them to cease operations. This left innocent commuters, including mothers, girls, schoolchildren, and the working class, stranded at bus stops.
NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab condemns the actions of those PMV drivers who chose to take the law into their own hands and disrupt essential public services.
""While we understand their frustration, such actions are unacceptable and only cause further hardship for the very public they serve, stated the Superintendent. ""Our priority is always the safety and well-being of our citizens, and to see innocent people suffer due to these actions is deeply concerning.""
Simatab confirmed that the injured bus driver is not deceased and is receiving medical attention. Furthermore, the suspect in the stabbing has been identified as a youth from Tatana village. Police are actively working with community leaders to ensure the suspect surrenders peacefully to face justice.
The NCD Metropolitan Superintendent assures the public that police have taken swift action and have the incident under control, “We have engaged with the aggrieved bus drivers and assured them of their security concerns, urging them to resume normal PMV services immediately. The general public and other PMV buses should not be held to ransom or subjected to intimidation.”
“Police presence in the affected areas has been increased to ensure public safety and the smooth resumption of transport services. We appeal to all citizens to remain calm and cooperate with the authorities. Justice will be served, and those responsible for both the stabbing and the subsequent unlawful disruptions will be held accountable,” Simatab added.
Meanwhile, police have informed all PMV operators to let the rule of law take its course continue to provide transport service, effective Thursday July 10th."

"Major roadwork contracts for WNB, Madang",08/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5141,"The recent finalization of two major roadwork contracts by the Department of Works and Highways (DoWH) represents a significant investment in the country’s infrastructure, with a total value close to K20 million.
Supported by Australia’s Transport Sector Support Program Phase 3 (TSSP3), these contracts aim to upgrade critical sections of the national highway network, particularly in the West New Britain and Madang provinces.
In West New Britain, Jay LW Contractors Limited has been awarded an almost K10 million contract for pavement rehabilitation and resealing works on a 24-kilometre section of the New Britain Highway between Balaha Box Culvert and Tiauru Bridge Number One.
These upgrades will enhance safety and provide more reliable road access for communities and businesses along this strategic agricultural corridor.
In Madang, South Pacific Construction Limited will undertake pavement repairs on 41.2 km of the Coastal Highway, following the award of a similar sized contract. The works will target critical sections and bridge approaches from Airport Junction to Surumarang Bridge, ensuring continued connectivity between the provincial capital and surrounding districts.
DoWH Secretary Gibson Holemba welcomed the contract signings.
“These investments demonstrate the Department’s commitment to delivering safe, reliable and climate-resilient infrastructure through open and competitive national procurement systems,” Secretary Holemba said.
“With strong support from our development partner Australia, we are also building capacity within local contracting and supervision services. This is key to sustaining transport infrastructure across PNG,” he added.
Dr Cate Rogers, Minister Counsellor Infrastructure, Australian High Commission, reaffirmed Australia’s support for local content and PNG leadership.
“Australia is proud to support infrastructure delivery that improves roads, builds PNG’s national systems and strengthens local industry. Prioritising local content, skills and suppliers is central to the way we work together.”
As Papua New Guinea marks 50 years of independence, these works reflect the enduring development partnership between PNG and Australia.
TSSP3 continues to support DoWH to rehabilitate roads, strengthen bridges, assess climate risks and foster institutional reform for a more effective, efficient and inclusive transport system for all Papua New Guineans.
The improvements in road access are expected to facilitate better connectivity for local communities and businesses, ultimately boosting economic activity in these regions."
Makiba condemns brutal killing in Magarima,08/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5140,"Member for Magarima and Minister for Bougainville Affairs, Manasseh Makiba, has condemned the recent torture and brutal killing of a woman in Magarima District, Hela Province, following accusations of sorcery allegedly linked to her husband’s death.
In a statement, MP Makiba expressed shock and sorrow, describing the incident as “inhumane, shameful, and a stain on the conscience of our society.”
“Such horrific acts have not been seen in Magarima for many years. It is deeply disturbing and utterly unacceptable that innocent, defenseless women—often widows or single mothers—continue to be targeted by baseless accusations of sorcery,” he said.
Makiba reminded the public that the Sorcery Act of 1971 was repealed in July 2013, following nationwide outcry and increasing cases of violence. Under the revised Criminal Code Act (Section 299A), any intentional killing related to sorcery accusations is classified as willful murder—a serious criminal offense.
“Justice must be pursued through lawful and constitutional means—not mob violence,” Minister Makiba stated. “The world is watching, and Papua New Guinea cannot afford to be a nation where violence masquerades as justice.”
The Minister confirmed that Provincial MP for Hela, Philip Undialu has also denounced the killing in the strongest terms and has called for immediate arrest and prosecution of those responsible.
Accordingly, Minister Makiba has instructed the Hela Provincial Police Commander, Superintendent Michael Welly, to launch an immediate investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice without delay.
“I have directed all community leaders, ward councillors, and LLG presidents across Magarima District to cooperate fully with the police. This includes both regular and reserve officers stationed in the district,” he added.
Minister Makiba emphasized that communities must not remain silent or passive. He called on citizens to become the first line of defense against such atrocities by standing with law enforcement, rejecting violence, and protecting the vulnerable.
“It is a sad day for Hela. But we must rise from this tragedy with a renewed commitment to uphold the rule of law, protect human life, and end the tragic cycle of sorcery accusation-related violence,” Minister Makiba concluded."
Strengthen early warning systems,08/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5137,"The National Weather Service has emphasised the urgency of investing in early warning systems, which are the first line of defence against disasters.
Director of the National Weather Service (NWS), Jimmy Gamoga, said at the opening of the National Partnership and Coordination Session on Early Warning Systems (EWS) in Port Moresby today.
Papua New Guinea continues to face increasing threats from natural hazards and climate-induced disasters such as landslides, floods, and droughts. Recent events, including the Mulitaka landslide in Enga Province and flooding in East Sepik, Western, and Morobe provinces, highlight the urgent need for robust early warning systems—especially in remote areas with limited access to timely alerts.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM), brought together a diverse group of stakeholders, including government agencies, United Nations agencies, telecommunications and media organisations, and development partners, to explore ways to strengthen people-centred early warning systems across Papua New Guinea.
The IOM in collaboration with the PNG NWS, and with financial support from the Government of Japan, hosted a National Partnership and Coordination Session on Early Warning Systems (EWS) in Port Moresby.
Through the Early Warning System Scale-Up in the Pacific Project, IOM is working to enhance disaster preparedness and resilience in Papua New Guinea, Fiji, and Vanuatu. This initiative, funded by the Government of Japan, aims to empower communities with timely, actionable information to reduce disaster risks.
IOM Chief of Mission, David Arnold, reaffirmed IOM’s commitment, stating, “This initiative is part of our broader commitment to anticipate disasters and empower communities with timely, actionable information—especially in remote areas where the risks are greatest.”
Key components of IOM’s EWS scale-up efforts include:
•	Enhancing public access to early warning messaging
•	Strengthening national coordination for disaster preparedness
•	Provision of Early Warning System kits to Emergency Operations Centres
The event also featured technical presentations from the NWS, National Maritime Safety Authority, Global Green Growth Institute, the Australian Government, and other partners. The NWS underscored the Government’s plans to establish a National Multi-Hazard Early Warning Centre and to broaden resilience-building initiatives across the country.
This EWS initiative aligns with Papua New Guinea’s Medium-Term Development Plan IV (2023–2027), particularly Strategic Priority Area 10.3 (ii), and reinforces IOM’s efforts to reduce the risks and impacts of disasters and climate change-induced displacement."
Legislative training to upskill CLRC staff,08/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5136,"The Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) has commenced a week-long Legislative Drafting Training for its officers, a key initiative to bolster its mandate on law review and reform recently.
The training was organized by CLRC’s HR to cater to important drafting skills required by lawyers and researchers to do their jobs.  It highlights CLRC’s efforts in enhancing and strengthening its capacity in legislative review and policy drafting, consultations, report finalization, implementation and post-legislative reviews.
These are critical components that make up the CLRC law review and reform process required by law. The training intends to consolidate these vital skills and equip officers with the knowledge to carve out the legal landscape of the country.
There were 15 topics presented that span from policy development to enactment and monitoring of the laws and their subsequent amendments, which provides a comprehensive insight into the legislative review process.
The training will ensure officers confidently understand the role of law in the development of the country, understand the important role that lawyers play in society in influencing development, and the special role of a legal draftsperson.
Delving into the first session of the training, officers were provided with case studies and recent legislative amendments to enable discussions on steps in effective legislative drafting and actual drafting of law. This training is essential to support the Commission in fulfilling its core mandate in law review and reform."

The quartet ran an impressive 40.23s, surprising the previous national record at 40.29s set by PNG track legends, Peter Pulu, Subul Babo, Amos Ali, and Allan Akia at the Tahiti Pacific Games in 1995.
The young athletes not only set a new record for PNG but also won the gold medal in the 4X100m to add to Team PNG’s medal tally – a fitting reward for the commitment and hard work of these athletes.

Eight surrender over sorcery-related killing,07/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5121,"Eight suspects are in police custody, including the individual who allegedly pulled the trigger in the sorcery-related torture and murder of a woman in Magarima, Hela Province.
Hela Provincial Police Commander (PPC), Superintendent Michael Welly said the suspects surrendered yesterday (Sunday 06th July 2025) with the assistance of local leaders, Margarima District CEO, and police personnel who facilitated the voluntary surrender.
PPC Welly said the act was condemned by leaders as both criminal and barbaric, prompting the immediate launch of a police-led manhunt supported by provincial and community leaders.
Hela Governor Philip Undialu and Minister for Bougainville Affairs and Magarima MP Manasseh Makiba visited Magarima on Friday, 04th July, and formally launched the operation to apprehend the suspects.
They appealed for community cooperation and a peaceful surrender of those involved.
“Police units deployed from Tari conducted coordinated arrests of the eight suspects. The suspects were transported to Tari Police Station for formal processing.
“Additional suspects have been identified where some individuals are believed to be from Biango Village, Kandep District, Enga Province, and require cross-border cooperation with Enga police,” PPC Welly said.
PPC Welly said the success of this operation underscores the importance of proactive leadership and strong community-police collaboration. He said Hela Province continues to demonstrate that justice is achievable when leaders on the ground work with law enforcement.
Superintendent Welly said the direct involvement of Governor Undialu and Minister Makiba, coupled with decisive police action, sends a strong message that sorcery-related violence in the province will not be tolerated.
PPC Welly said the sorcery-related killings are fully prosecutable. The Sorcery Act was repealed in 2013, making it clear that sorcery-related accusations do not justify violence. Offenders are subjected to charges including murder, torture, and unlawful confinement, with potential penalties of life imprisonment.
Police investigation continues with more arrests expected to be made."
Digicel ExxonMobil Cup Resumes,07/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5118,"After a bye last week, the Digicel ExxonMobil Cup resumed over the weekend with exciting rugby league action. The round featured standout performances, including a surprise win by the WNB Kimbe Cutters over PRK Gulf Isou at home, while the Agmark Gurias defeated the Lae Snax Tigers.
The PRK Mendi Muruks continued its fine form beating the NPL Enga Mioks 26 - 22 at Sir John Amban Oval in Minj, Jiwaka.
The Muruks ran six tries over the Mioks line in a remarkable display of attacking prowess, but struggled with conversions. Kumul Kaupa converted only one goal from six attempts. The Mioks scored four tries of their own but it was not enough to topple the competition leaders.
The later match at the same venue between Wamp Nga Mt Hagen Eagles and Kroton Hela Wigmen provided another thriller. Both teams went toe to toe with Eagles coming out on top with a 30 - 14 victory.
The double header in Port Moresby brought some surprises. The NCDC Moni Plus Port Moresby Vipers ran riot over Gas Resources Central Dabaris 26 - 4. The Vipers walked home with two competition points but it spells a lot for the Dabaris as they return to drawing board.
In the later match, the WNB Kimbe Cutters out-muscled PRK Gulf Isou 30 - 18 in a well-deserved win. The Isou has been the most improved team over the last two months but couldn't go past the Cutters who wanted it more in that game.
In Rabaul's Queen Elizabeth Park, the home side Agmark Gurias welcomed visiting Lae Snax Tigers in a hostile reception. Gurias crossed over for 6 tries and Derrick Voku stared in the game with two tries effort. Tigers on the other hand bagged only two and were outplayed by the host team.
The final game of the round on Sunday saw Bintangor Goroka Lahanis host Asila Waghi Tumbe at the National Sports Institute in Goroka. The Lahanis narrowly escaped with a close win 22 – 20.

Court dismisses allegations against City Manager,07/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5117,"The Waigani District Court has dismissed allegations of Abuse of Office and Conspiracy against NCD City Manager Ravu Frank, due to abuse of process.
Magistrate Paul Puri Nii made this ruling stating that proper process of proceeding with this matter was not followed by the complainant.
Nii said the complaint alleged that the defendant, as the city manager, abused his powers and conspired with others to terminate him as an employee of the National Capital District Commission (NCDC) over a land issue. However, Magistrate Nii said the complainant did not follow the right process to sue the city manager for these allegations.
“(The) complainant alleged that the defendant was involved in illegal proceedings to take away his land, so he cannot connect his termination from employment to fraud or other illegal damage. These allegations should be processed on their own,” Nii said. “Illegal land use and fraud are distinct criminal matters that should not be connected with the unlawful termination of employment.”
“What the complainant should have done was to arrest the defendant for forgery or conspiracy without mentioning unlawful termination of employment to the police because this is an abuse of process.
“In my view, an employer has the power to hire and fire his or her subordinates, citing reasons associated with their conduct; this is a normal operation of an organisation.
“The appropriate process is that the complainant should have written to the defendant to review his decision to terminate or seek advice, or give notice to NCDC under section 4 of the NCDC Act and sue for damages for breach of contract or for reinstatement, which the complainant did not do.
“The initiative taken by the complainant by referring the defendant to the police for his employment termination with NCDC for the allegations of forgery and obtaining land is not proper, and it is an abuse of office.
“The criminal court does not deal with employers terminating employees. I believe the judicial review court might be the appropriate court,” Nii added.
Meanwhile, it was before the court that Frank, 54, of Alewai Village in Rigo Central Province, was alleged to have ordered the human resource office to suspend an enforcement coordinator from the NCDC, claiming that his employment contract had expired.
The coordinator, Mathias Repo, was issued a suspension letter on October 4th, 2023, and subsequently terminated. Repo filed a police report, stating that his contract at that time ran from July 1, 2021, to July 31st, 2024, and that his employment was therefore still valid. He added that he had been with the commission for more than 16 years and had never faced any disciplinary charges.
Police allege that Frank conspired with others at NCDC to remove Repo in order to take ownership of a piece of land at Korobosea that the complainant had obtained through a PNG Lands Board tender, nine years ago."
PM condemns torture of woman accused of sorcery,07/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5115,"Prime Minister James Marape has expressed profound sorrow and outrage in response to the brutal torture and murder of a woman in Hela Province, an act reportedly driven by unfounded accusations of sorcery.
This tragic event, which took place over the weekend in a remote area of the Highlands, has not only shocked the local community but has also reverberated throughout the nation, eliciting widespread condemnation from leaders, civil society organizations, and international observers.
Marape in a statement highlighted the need for a collective stand against violence and superstitious beliefs that lead to such heinous acts.
“I firstly offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the woman whose life was so cruelly taken,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“This is a heartbreaking and shameful act. In this day and age, there is no justification—cultural, traditional, or emotional—for such violence. It is murder, and it will be treated as such.”
He called for an urgent investigation into the incident and urged law enforcement authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice.
Thanks to the swift response by local authorities and the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, eight suspects were arrested shortly after the incident.
The arrests were made possible through coordination between the Provincial Police Commander (PPC), community leaders, church groups, and provincial leaders.
The Prime Minister also emphasized the importance of education and awareness campaigns to combat the underlying beliefs that perpetuate violence against women, particularly in cases of alleged sorcery.
The incident has reignited debates around gender-based violence and human rights in Papua New Guinea, with many advocating for stronger protections and interventions for vulnerable populations.
Community leaders and activists have joined the call for an end to mob justice and vigilantism, stressing the need to uphold the rule of law and respect for human rights in all situations.
As the nation grapples with the implications of this tragedy, calls for reform and healing within communities are paramount, with an emphasis on fostering a culture of respect, truth, and justice."

""Security forces will continue to work with communities and elected leaders to remove these guns and bring to justice those who think violence is an acceptable solution,” Manning added.
Further information on this matter will be made available at an appropriate time."
ENB acknowledges LLG election deferral,07/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5111,"East New Britain Province has acknoweldged the deferral of Local Level Government elections by the PNG Electoral Commission.
Provincial Administrator and chairman of the Provincial Election Advisory Committee (PEAC), Levi Mano, outlined that the province received a circular from the PNG Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai, via the Provincial Electoral Commission office in Kokopo.
The change will see polling moved back by two months; from July 12th to September 27th.
This will also affect the date for the return of writs, which has been deferred from the 22nd of August to the 17th of November, 2025.
“I would like to assure the PNGEC and the people of East New Britain Province, that we will be adhering to this circular and the proposed changes in the dates for polling,” said Mano.
“In saying that, we as a province are ready to conduct polling in the province, as we have been preparing for the conduct of the LLG Elections since last year, 2024.
“The PEAC is a key partner to the PNGEC in the rollout of the LLG elections over the years, and stands by to support the completion of the election process in the province.
“Despite the delay now in polling, this also gives ample time for candidates to do their campaigns, and likewise the PEAC to finalise preparations for polling in all the 23 local level governments.”
Mano outlined that the reasons stated for the deferral of polling include:
•	The conduct of several elections at the same time, which includes five national by-elections, the Motu-Koita Assembly elections and the LLG elections in the country, that is inclusive of 12 provinces that are voting for both Ward Members and LLG presidents;
•	The proclamation and late notifications of new wards and LLGs in parts of the country;
•	Administrative irregularities that require resolution from the Department of Provincial and Local-level Government Affairs (DPLGA); and
•	Funding and procurement delays, which remain a critical challenge for the PNGEC.
“The above reasons do not affect us, but as a province, we will go by the directives given to us, to defer the polling to the new dates that have been set,” continued the PA.
“We continue to encourage a peaceful extended campaign period for our candidates contesting in this year’s LLG elections, while we continue to ensure our preparations are on par before the 180,000 plus eligible voters in the province, go to the polls come September this year.”"
Waiembi debuts in Hunters’ shake-up,06/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5107,"PNG Hunters' new recruit Khaiya Waiembi makes his debut in the Hunters line up in the match against the Townville Blackhawks in round 16 of Hostplus Cup Competition in Port Moresby.
Waiembi joined the Hunters recently from Central Queensland Caprass, though player exchange, and will come off the bench in the number 17 jumper.
PNG Hunters coach Paul Aiton said Waiembi will add value to the team as he has proved a handy player in the competition.
Aiton said, “He’s hard to stop. He’s a really powerful player, and we are lucky enough to have players that can add attack, but there is attack and defence as well.”
The Hunters have assembled a strong side ahead of their clash today.
The 10th placed PNG Hunters welcomes electric Sanny Wabo, who returns to fullback after spending a few weeks on the sideline through injury. His return pushed Douglas David to the wing, and veteran Brendon Nima is the one making way.
Adding an attaching flair to PNG Hunters outfit is the inclusion of livewire five-eighth in Gairo Voro.
The young five-eighth became a talking point within the rugby league community the last fortnight after he was sensationally axed from the team. He returns on the bench in number 24 jumper and will have a point to prove on Sunday.
In another notable change to the team, halfback Jamie Mavoko has lost his position to Joshua Lau, who's starting at halfback for the first time in over six months. Since coming from nasty knee injury, Lau started off . After losing three consecutive matches, Aiton’s men are aiming for positive outcome on home turf.
The Hunters coach is urging the rugby league community in Port Moresby to support them on Sunday as they take on the Blackhawks."

The name ""Yasina"" refers to a prized local orchid native to the area. Initially, the area was referred to as the Yasina Nature Park, reflecting the significance of this native orchid and the natural environment. Community residents were thrilled to have achieved this milestone and renamed the area Yasina Community Conservation Area.
The conservation deed covers five clans (the Semeya Nagai, Ekesa Gegiya, Gakuhu Nagai, Migotahi, and Gosi Nagai clans) with a combined estimated population of over 500 people and covering a total of 2,307 ha of customary land that lies in the eastern part of the Bismarck Forest Corridor.
The signing signified the clans’ commitment to protecting their natural resources and creating a thriving, sustainable environment where biodiversity is preserved, cultural traditions are respected, and community livelihoods are improved.
Chairman of the Yasina Community Conservation Area, Paul Pake, said “the signing of this conservation deed will enable the people to protect their land and resources and allow them to take ownership and responsibility of their actions towards their land and resources.”
The Community Relations Manager for the Wildlife Conservation Society in Papua New Guinea, Bennie Atigini, stated that “the signing of the conservation deed will help the community members in managing and protecting their land, including its flora and fauna”.
He further explained that the Yasina Land Use Management Plan serves as a strategic guide to the conservation deed and will help communities make informed decisions about how to use and manage their land and natural resources sustainably, while protecting this important ecosystem, cultural values and biodiversity. Both the deed and the plan will also help communities attract external support and partnerships for long-term environmental and social benefits.
This community is the second in Eastern Highlands Province to sign a conservation deed to formalise the management of their customary land and to conserve the local environment.
The rules for the management area were decided by the residents of Yasina and collectively cover three different land-use zones.
1.	Zone 1 (1, 465 ha) encompasses a restricted area where no human activities or settlements are allowed.
2.	Zone 2 (358 ha) is a buffer area where some activities can be conducted following the rules defined in the management plan.
3.	Zone 3 (484 ha) is for general use and settlement by residents.
The development of the land-use planning process was supported by the Sustainable Wildlife Management (SWM) Programme since 2022, funded by the European Union, and implemented in PNG by the Wildlife Conservation Society.  WCS has assisted six communities in the PNG Highlands to prepare and sign respective conservation deeds, with the Yasina conservation deed being the most recent.

"Digicel PNG Foundation Awards K100,000 Grant to iCare4U Center",04/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5096,"Digicel PNG Foundation has reaffirmed its dedication to supporting vulnerable communities by awarding a K100,000 Community Grant to the iCare4U Center in Gereka. It marks the third grant the Foundation has provided to the organization since 2019.
This funding will support the construction of a new cottage for women and children affected by HIV and gender-based violence.
A groundbreaking ceremony at the iCare4U Center celebrated not only the beginning of the new facility but also the Foundation’s continued investment in grassroots initiatives to restore dignity, foster inclusion, and empower women across Papua New Guinea.
The Chairman and members of the Digicel Pacific Board attended the event while they were in Port Moresby for their board meeting, engaging with community members to better understand the challenges faced by survivors and to recognize the center’s holistic approach, addressing not only medical needs but also stigma, discrimination, mental health, and reintegration into society.
Since the inception of Digicel PNG Foundation, it has been a catalyst for change, funding community-led initiatives that tackle critical social issues. Through its Community Grants Program, the Foundation has supported hundreds of local organizations in delivering sustainable, high-impact projects in health, education, and social development.
“We believe in the power of local organizations to drive meaningful change,” said Valda Kereu, Acting CEO of the Digicel PNG Foundation.
“Our ongoing partnership with iCare4U reflects our shared vision of creating safe, inclusive spaces where women and children can heal, grow, and thrive.”
The 2025 grant will fund the construction of a second cottage to meet the increasing demand for safe accommodation. Many women and girls seeking refuge at iCare4U have been rejected by their families and face ongoing stigma. The new facility will provide a secure, supportive environment where they can access care, rebuild their lives, and prepare for reintegration into society.
This initiative is part of the Foundation’s broader strategy to combat gender-based violence, promote gender equity, and strengthen community resilience. By investing in infrastructure and services that directly impact women’s lives, the Foundation is contributing to a more just and compassionate society. “Every grant we award is an investment in hope,” said Valda Kereu.
“We are proud to stand alongside organizations like iCare4U that are doing the hard work on the ground to uplift and transform lives.”
iCare4U founders George and Crystal Nita expressed their gratitude to the Digicel PNG Foundation. “We are deeply thankful for this opportunity to build a dedicated cottage to support women and children,” said George.
The Digicel PNG Foundation is committed to empowering communities through strategic partnerships, sustainable development, and to playing a part to help to ensure that every Papua New Guinean can live with dignity and purpose."
PM Marape highlights shared values on US Independence Day,04/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5094,"Fourth of July is US Independence Day and Prime Minister James Marape has extended warm congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, the U.S. Government, and the American people on their 249th Independence Day, celebrating the enduring values of liberty, democracy, and faith.
Prime Minister Marape is currently in St. Louis, Missouri, attending the 62nd General Conference Session of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
He has been invited to deliver remarks highlighting “PNG for Christ 2024,” a national Christian outreach initiative, and reflecting on the significance of the day, Prime Minister Marape praised the United States as “the world’s greatest free market economy, the greatest democracy, and the greatest Christian nation.”
“As we mark the 249th birthday of the United States, we also reflect on the rejuvenation of Christianity and the global evangelisation of the Christian message,” he said.
“The United States stands as a beacon of freedom, faith, and opportunity — a country built on timeless values that allow every person to become the best version of themselves.”
He said the symbolic timing of the event — a major religious gathering held on the American Independence Day — served as a powerful reminder of the importance of religious liberty and freedom of conscience, principles also enshrined in Papua New Guinea’s founding law.
“Our Constitution, especially Section 43, upholds religious liberty and embraces freedom of conscience in its entirety,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Just like the United States, Papua New Guinea is a land of great diversity — not from migration, but founded on our rich indigenous heritage. We, too, cherish freedom, faith, and unity in diversity.”
He commended the nearly two-and-a-half centuries of American nation building and noted how the U.S. model of democracy, free enterprise, and religious tolerance continues to inspire countries around the world, including Papua New Guinea.
“As we prepare to mark 50 years of our own independence in September 2025, we look to friends and partners like the United States as examples and inspiration,” Prime Minister Marape said.
The Prime Minister concluded by extending Papua New Guinea’s heartfelt best wishes to President Trump, the U.S. Government, and the American people on this important national day."
TIPNG Emphasizes Need to Preserve ICAC’s Integrity,04/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5093,"Transparency International PNG (TIPNG) is calling on authorities to safeguard the independence of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) from political influence.
TIPNG Chairman, Peter Aitsi made this call following reports of administrative issues within the ICAC and is calling for the constitutional basis for the ICAC’s functions to investigate, arrest and prosecute corrupt conduct in PNG to be protected and not fall to political control.
“From the information emerging, the issues affecting the organisation could be tussle for power amongst the leadership of the ICAC, and seem largely administrative in nature. Papua New Guineans are justifiably right to be disappointed as we expected a greater degree of professionalism and better conduct from senior people who were appointed to a publicly-funded entity such as ICAC. They were all senior and experienced individuals who should have been able to resolve these issues among themselves, rather than impacting the operations of the institution under their care,” said Mr Aitsi.
He further said, “In light of the circumstances it is important to remember that the fundamental objective of all concerned citizens is to ensure ICAC is free of political influence. While the individual office holders might have issues, the integrity and independence of the office and its mandate must be upheld for the protection of all Papua New Guineans.”
Aitsi also stated that from reports received, the ICAC Appointments Committee has considered the findings received from the internal government investigation team and have made their decision in order to maintain stability of ICAC.
This include the suspension of the incumbent commissioners and to appoint interim commissioners pending further investigations.
“TIPNG remains ready to support and ensure ICAC is able to fully take up its responsibilities and deliver the results our public is demanding,” said Mr. Aitsi.
The interim commissioners will be required to provide leadership and direction during this period, and it is hoped they will reinforce proper governance and provide further support to the ICAC oversight committee as they are appointed.
TIPNG urges Government to assess and firmly establish the findings from their internal review team and move to conclude this matter with urgency."

PNG seeks to harvest oil and gas reserves before clean energy era arrives,03/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5082,"As talks around climate change intensifies globally, with countries looking to shift to the use of clean energy in the next 20 years, PNG must harvest its oil and gas reserves within this time frame in order to gain from it.
PNG has huge energy reserves that need to be tapped into, developed and sold before the world moves to clean energy.
“Our oil and gas resources in the country, in the next 20 years we want to progress.  I am not a prophet but trust me in this one - technology and science is emerging. If we don’t harvest from our resource in 20 years, in 20 years the world would have migrated to clean energy, that conversation is being discussed as we speak - cleaner energy options are being looked at. There is no other use for our gas and oil – it is purely for energy, petroleum products and electricity as well as other by-products of petroleum like fertilizers and etc. But the world is conscious on shifting towards cleaner energy and in 20 years’ time from today, write this down, the world will see oil and gas from the context of fossil fuel with carbon footprint. And when they see this, your gas will be redundant just like today the world sees coal in a negative sense.”
And in order to avoid this, Prime Minister James Marape is taking a strategic approach to ensure these reserves are harvested before their demand drops, thus reducing the profitability and value of these resources. Investors must be secured and outstanding petroleum and gas projects need to be developed.
Prime Minister left for the US yesterday in pursuit of this, where he will meet with executives of energy giant, ExxonMobil, to discuss outstanding LNG projects like the Papua LNG, Pnyang and Wildebeest so these projects can be developed and resources harvested.
“My trip to US will see (me) meeting with ExxonMobil. I will synchronize conversations around Papua, Pyyang and Wildebeest LNGs. ExxonMobil is a substantial investor in our country and a good corporate citizen. Based on the success of the PNG LNG, it is our strategic pursuit to make sure Papua LNG is progressed. After Papua, the construction migrates to Pnyang and after Pnyang, we looking at migrating construction also to Wildebeest.
“This is labelled as the Southern fault belt in geological terms – that’s Western Province, Hela, Southern Highlands and Gulf – we have substantial oil and gas resource there. We want to optimize those in the context of harvesting the gas,” Marape said.
Marape also acknowledged the investment made by Total Energy SA in the Papua LNG project. Total is also involved in deep sea exploration in the Mailu area of Abau District
“I want to commended Total. Total’s spending over 100 million dollars this year on deep sea exploration on a field called Mailu field, somewhere in between Milne Bay and Central, an exciting field in that part of our country,” Marape added.
“As a country in the next 20 years, we want to mobilize and harvest all our gas and oil as the world moves towards conversation on clean energy and that is the game plan we have.”
While in the US, Marape will also meet with Newmont executives to discuss the Wafi-Golpu Mining Development Contract with the aim of gaining above 55 per cent of the stake in this project.
“It is no secret – all of you know by now. We are always in negotiation to win above 55 per cent state take in a project – whether its royalty, equity or levies or other earnings like tax, we always want to get a minimum at 55 per cent.”
The Prime Minister says this agreement and other resource agreements are entered into on a 40-year contract basis and it is vital to get it right in the first place before parties sign on it."
Goi takes a hard line on airport security breaches,03/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5080,"In a firm stance to restore and maintain the integrity of Papua New Guinea’s aviation sector, Civil Aviation Minister Wake Goi has issued a zero-tolerance warning against security breaches, bribery, and smuggling.
Minister Goi declared that security must be the highest priority, with no leniency for officers, companies, or operators involved in any form of misconduct.
“Security priority number one,” Goi emphasized. “If you’re involved once, you’re out — no second chances.”
The warning targets all aviation personnel, including security staff, charter flight operators, and aircrew. Goi stressed that any security officer who allows a prohibited item, such as firearms or drugs, to pass through airport screening will be terminated immediately.
If a security firm is repeatedly implicated, their contract with the National Airport Corporation (NAC) will also be revoked.
The crackdown extends to rural airstrips and charter operations, with clear instructions for NAC managers at all 22 airports to enforce thorough checks. Pilots, crew, and owners of aircraft carrying illegal cargo will face prosecution.
Goi reminded all aviation staff that public safety is paramount and failure to meet civil aviation standards will result in job loss. “You are not the employer,” he warned, “you must comply or you’re out.”"

He further warned the drivers to be considerate about the road conditions, road signs, road users, and their passengers when traveling on the road.
“This will help you avoid accidents while on the road. Other surrounding factors include, vehicle's mechanical faults. When accidents happen, please report them to the police and make sure to follow up to claim insurance if your vehicle's documents are in order. Always work closely with the police.

CLRC reviews laws on underwater leases and waterways,03/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5078,"The Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) advised the Special Parliamentary Committee on Customary Land and Land Reform about its ongoing review of laws relating to underwater leases and waterways in Papua New Guinea.
This initiative, outlined in Terms of Reference number 19 (TOR) 19 - originates from the 2019 National Land Summit Resolutions and was authorized by the Minister for Justice and Attorney General. CLRC Deputy Secretary for Corporate Services, Xavier Winnia, presented this alongside three other TORs related to customary land to the Committee.
TOR 19 addresses critical legal gaps regarding coastal and riparian rights, focusing on land located beneath water - a topic not sufficiently covered in existing legislation.
Deputy Secretary Winnia briefed Committee Chair, Keith Iduhu and members, including Kokopo MP Ereman ToBaining Jnr and Moresby North-West MP Lohia Boe Samuel, on the legal parameters of TOR 19.
“We call it a new concept because it’s not currently captured by law - that’s what the Commission is examining,” said Mr. Winnia.
Mr. Winnia identified several key policy, legal, and administrative challenges under TOR 19:
•	Absence of a national policy on underwater leases and waterways
•	No statutory definitions for 'land', 'land under water', 'underwater leases', or related ownership
•	Questions around whether landowners retain ownership under state acquisition - by compulsion or consent instead of full alienation or forfeiture
•	Need to define nautical limits: the start and end of traditional coastal and riparian rights versus statutory boundaries
•	Ineffective administration of customary land, indicating the need for reform within the Land Department
Committee members scrutinized each TOR’s status, raising detailed questions on policy, legal frameworks, finances, and administrative feasibility.
Deputy Secretary Winnia reported that extensive provincial consultations were held with local administrations, District Development Authorities, landowner groups, NGOs, and government agencies. Essential views gauged during these consultations were consolidated into four draft reports, each featuring preliminary recommendations. These reports will be further vetted before submission to the National Cabinet as formal law reform proposals."

Chimbu Provincial Police Commander Superintendent Mazuc Rubiang said the auxiliary police officers who aided the escape were also arrested the same day and are now detained at Kundiawa police station. The remandees escaped on June 25th, 2025.
“On the night of the escape, the auxiliary left Kundiawa for his home in Mogiage earlier, and then the woman who escaped with the others followed her husband to the village. Police intelligence indicates that he facilitated the escape by providing spare keys to the cell blocks. They are both now detained in the cell. The woman, namely Martha Mane, who was charged with murder, was committed to the National court a day after she escaped, so an additional charge will be laid on her,” PPC Rubiang said.
He said the twelve men are still on the run, and police and the community are working together to have them arrested and charged accordingly.
“I want you all to surrender to the police because most of you have committed serious offences, so it is best you surrender to the police and let the court process continue. I do not want the relatives of the victims to take the law into their own hands if they see you moving around freely. Please come forward to the police and go to court and clear yourself,” PPC Rubiang said.
Rubiang further added that police officers are working closely with the public to gather information from those in hiding."
Teachers failing to take up roles in remote schools,03/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5076,"Reports of absentism by teachers posted to a remote school on the borders of Madang and East Sepik provinces recently prompted the Provincial Member and Governor for Madang, Ramsey Pariwa to make a first-hand visit recently.

Peacebuilder Carries PNG Hopes to Peace Summit,02/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5074,"In a powerful moment of representation and resilience, Papua New Guinea's Tony Tambi Jr from Enga Province stood tall among global peacebuilders at the 2025 Global Peace Chain Summit in Sydney, becoming the first Papua New Guinean ever selected for the summit since its inception in 2018.
With carrying the hopes of conflict-affected communities in Papua New Guinea, Tony Tambi Jr stepped onto the global stage —not as a politician or diplomat, but as a grassroots peacebuilder.
Selected as one of only 20 fully funded delegates out of over 100 from 40+ countries, Tambi’s journey from the tribal crisis zones of the Highlands to the policy halls of Sydney is a testament to local leadership in peacebuilding. He currently leads the Economic Security Unit at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in the Highlands, where he works directly with displaced families and communities torn by tribal violence.
“This opportunity allowed me to share Papua New Guinea’s story of resilience and community-led peacebuilding,” Tambi said.
“It reaffirmed that even in the most remote and conflict-affected areas, local leadership and dialogue can build bridges.”
At the summit, he engaged in forums on youth leadership, refugee responses, and international cooperation, while also presenting his Makole community reconciliation initiative.
Delegates visited the New South Wales Parliament, shared traditional cultures during a Cultural Peace Walk, and explored collaborative ways to address global conflict.
Tambi’s participation gave PNG a voice in international peace dialogue—one rooted in lived experience, cultural identity, and grassroots action. His story now inspires a new generation of young Papua New Guineans to rise as agents of peace in their own communities."
Unreliable power supply poses a threat to development of Lae SEZ,02/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5073,"For Lae to have a Special Economic Zone, its power supply has to be reliable. Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, brought this to the attention of PNG Ports Corporation, labelling Lae as a ""City of Blackouts.""
“Lae is probably the blackout city of Papua New Guinea and I want to stress to the Chairman and CEO of PNG Ports Corporation that, to have a SEZ you must have reliable power and you need to factor that in your plan. Most people will come into your SEZ if they know they can be guaranteed with power instead of the constant blackouts right now in Lae.
“It’ll be difficult for us to attract contractors when there is constant blackouts in Lae.”
According to World Bank, for a city to effectively function as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), it requires robust infrastructure. This includes reliable electricity and water supply, efficient transportation links, reliable telecommunications, and adequate waste management systems. These elements are crucial for supporting industrial activities, attracting investment, and ensuring the smooth operation of businesses within the SEZ.
“I’ve been to many SEZ’s around the world, they don’t depend on the power utility, they provide their own power, water and sewerage. I want to challenge the Board and management, how do you make it more attractive because we will give the incentives?” Maru asked
By having a Special Economic Zonein Lae, it will become an economic hub with increased investment, job creation, and improved infrastructure — but it will also require careful planning to manage social and environmental impacts."

Sea Shepherd assists Bougainville combat illegal fishing,01/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5057,"Sea Shepherd vessel Allankay has arrived in Buka to support law enforcement efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing through at-sea patrols in partnership with the Bougainville Police Service and the Department of Primary Industries and Marine Resources.
Bougainvillean law enforcement agents who have the authority to board, inspect and arrest fishing vessels engaged in criminal activity, will be stationed on board Allankay, working alongside Sea Shepherd crew to patrol the internal waters of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville which consists of two main islands, but also several atolls including remote places like Nissan, the Carterets, the Takuu Atoll, the Nuguria Islands and the Nukumanu Islands.
On arrival in Buka, Allankay was welcomed by the ABG President Ishmael Toroama, who stated that Sea Shepherd Global is supporting the nation during a critical time in the region’s history and noted the arrival of Allankay as “a milestone”, stating that “actions speak louder than words” when thanking Sea Shepherd Global for delivering on a commitment to send a ship to support patrolling efforts.
The Autonomous Region of Bougainville is located in the tropical waters of the Coral Triangle, a global epicenter of marine biodiversity often referred to as the “Amazon of the Seas” because it hosts over three-quarters of known coral species, providing food, habitat and spawning grounds for over 3,000 species of fish, six of seven species of sea turtles, 950 different types of mollusks and 458 species of crustaceans.
Many of those species are endemic or endangered and they need to be protected from illegal fishing, a practice that also poses a major threat to the people of Bougainville since subsistence and artisanal fishing are a pillar of the economy.
In his speech, Sea Shepherd Global’s Director of Campaigns Peter Hammarstedt said, “As environmentalists, we believe in being proactive rather than reactive in assisting the Autonomous Bougainville Government to tackle the conservation challenges facing the Coral Triangle, one of the most beautiful and important marine ecosystems in the world. Thus, the time to support the People of Bougainville is not tomorrow. It’s not in two years’ time. The time to support is today.”"
Parliamentary Committee begins inquiry into state authorities,01/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5055,"The Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery (SPCPSRSD) is intensifying its efforts to ensure robust governance and accountability across government authorities, with a particular focus on Papua New Guinea's vital forestry, minerals, and fisheries sectors.
The Committee expressed its satisfaction with the Papua New Guinea Forest Authority's (PNGFA) decision to re-engage the services of SGS Limited. SGS Limited provides log export monitoring services. The Chairman of the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery, Gary Juffa, stated, ""The Committee is pleased that the PNGFA has re-engaged the service of SGS Limited. This is a positive step by the national government to seriously address good governance within the forestry sector, a critical element necessary for PNG to avoid being placed on the grey list.""
Despite this positive development, the Committee affirmed its intent to continue its inquiry into the PNG Forest Authority. A notice has been sent to the PNG Forest Authority requesting further information regarding their operations. The Committee highlighted that serious recommendations from the Toss Barnett inquiry and the SABL inquiry have, in its view, not been adequately implemented. The ongoing inquiry will also assess how the government plans to implement its commitment to ban round log exports.
In line with promoting national development, the Committee strongly encourages Papua New Guinean companies to engage in downstream processing. It also urges the national government to collaborate with District Development Authorities, provincial governments, and Papua New Guinean development companies and organizations to achieve this objective.
The broader objective of the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery's reviews into various government-created authorities is to determine whether these authorities are meeting their responsibilities to their stakeholders, primarily the people of PNG.
The Committee aims to ascertain if these authorities are effectively carrying out their duties, including monitoring, reviewing, charging fines and penalties where necessary, and regulating appropriately. The Committee has found that in many instances, authorities are not performing these duties efficiently or effectively enough.
As part of these comprehensive reviews, the Committee will also be conducting inquiries into:
•	The PNG Forest Authority
•	The Minerals Resource Authority
•	The National Fisheries Authority
The overarching goal of these inquiries is to ensure that these organizations are adequately and sufficiently protecting the interests of Papua New Guineans.
The Committee in a statement emphasized that it remains committed to pursuing its agenda of public inquiry to ensure transparency and effectiveness in the public sector and to ensure these authorities are protecting the interests of Papua New Guinea."

PNGUoT graduates to be globally competitive,01/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5053,"Engineering graduates from the Papua New Guinea University of Technology, in Lae, are now able to work anywhere in the world without the need to undergo additional assessments.
The atmosphere at PNGUoT on Monday, June 30th, was a mixture of pride, relief, enthusiasm and satisfaction.
The Taraka campus looked pristine as it welcomed local and international visitors to join PNGUoT as it celebrated the accreditation of all five of its academic programs, under the Faculty of Engineering.
The programs were accredited by Engineers Australia, under the prestigious Washington Accord, following a comprehensive review in September 2024.
The journey to offer globally recognised engineering degrees with honours, to PNGUoT graduates, started in 2017, and came to a successful close on December 18, 2024, when its courses were granted full accreditation by Engineers Australia.
In a press briefing before the main event, chancellor Sam Koim said this is not just an achievement for the university, but also for PNG, as PNGUoT is the first institution in the Pacific to have its engineering courses on par with the rest of the world.
“This is a very important moment not only for the university and the students who are going to be graduating from the five engineering courses but also for the country, as we are turning 50 years old,” Koim stated. “We reflect on what we have achieved and what we are capable of achieving.
“This is a very good milestone and that would not have been possible without the active participation and involvement of the vice chancellor and the senior management, academic staff and the industry.”
Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, Kinoka Feo, said PNGUoT’s accreditation is one of the top three events that will be highlighted by his ministry in commemoration of PNG’s 50th Independence anniversary.
“For us, that fits in well with the 50th anniversary of Papua New Guinea and my continual demand – so to speak – to all our universities and colleges, is to increase access and improve quality,” Minister Feo said.
“Unitech, I’m proud and happy and thank you for the strong leadership, vice chancellor and chancellor. It had to start with leadership, and for you both to provide strong leadership and for a supportive team to work together to achieve this milestone, is testament to your leadership and the combined effort of everyone involved.”
Minister Feo said this achievement should serve as a stepping stone towards continuous improvement for PNGUoT, while other tertiary institutions in the country need to step up and be globally competitive as well."

Doctor Behind Fake COVID-19 Research Firm Arrested,01/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5046,"Police have arrested the owner of a fake medical drug company for allegedly misappropriating K5 million of funds allocated for research on COVID-19 drugs.
According to the director of the National Fraud and Anti-Corruption Directorate (NFACD) Detective Superintendent Robert Volo, K5 million was allegedly paid for the Research and Testing of Corona virus (COVID-19) Drugs in 2022 by the National Aids Council Secretariat (NACS) to a fake company owned by the named man, Dr Bomai Kerenga. However, it was discovered that these monies were misapplied without spending on the intended purpose.
Police alleged that in August 2020, the named man took advantage of the COVID-19 situation in 2019 and registered the fake company for the Scientific Research of COVID-19 drugs. The man then submitted a proposal to the National Executive Council of which the NEC accepted and approved K10.2 million to conduct Research and Testing of COVID-19 drugs. This drew negative criticisms back then.
Volo said in 2022, the National Government allocated K5million of the approved funds into the Trust Account of NACS for the fake medical company, where the payments were drawn down by the owner of the company from there.
He said the owner of the fake company instructed NACs to pay into nominated accounts for the service providers who unfortunately were not related to the Research and Testing of COVID-19 drugs.
Volo said police investigation uncovered the unrelated expenditures, including the legal bills, hire cars, creditors, and individuals not related to the scientific research, which resulted in his arrest."

IOM and PNG Affirm Commitment to Migration and Development,29/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5026,"The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reaffirmed its strong and growing partnership with the Government of Papua New Guinea during a high-level courtesy visit by IOM Regional Director for Asia Pacific, Iori Kato to the Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso.
The engagement underscored the shared commitment and strong relationship between IOM and the government of Papua New Guinea in addressing the country’s most pressing migration and development challenges, particularly in the context of climate change, disaster response, internal displacement, rapid population growth, rural-urban migration and increased regional mobility.
During the meeting, IOM reiterated its support for Papua New Guinea’s national priorities through a comprehensive and collaborative approach focused on:
•	Humanitarian assistance and disaster risk management: Enhancing preparedness and response capacities for vulnerable communities at risk of displacement due to environmental and socio-economic pressures.
•	Planned relocations and local development: Providing technical assistance to support safe, voluntary movements and community-driven planning in climate-affected areas.
•	Border and migration governance: Supporting the Government of Papua New Guinea to implement its border management priorities and strengthen systems that enable safe, orderly, and well-managed migration for all, in line with its growing role as a country of origin, transit, and destination in the Pacific region.
•	Labour mobility and human capital development: Facilitating inclusive labour mobility pathways and workforce development focusing empowering youth and marginalized populations to build a resilient and skilled workforce that meets evolving labour market demands.
•	Land governance: Supporting inclusive dialogue and participatory land governance approaches that recognize the links between migration, displacement, and access to land; promoting respect for traditional ownership systems and fostering social cohesion in affected communities.
•	Service delivery: Strengthening national and sub-national capacities to plan and deliver inclusive, responsive essential services in displacement-affected communities, aligned with long-term development goals and ensuring no one is left behind.
Deputy Prime Minister Rosso acknowledged IOM’s continued technical and operational support in helping Papua New Guinea manage its complex migration landscape.
“Papua New Guinea is facing urgent challenges from rapid population growth and urban drift, which are placing immense pressure on basic services and contributing to law-and-order issues in our towns and cities,” he said.
“At the same time, climate change is threatening the very existence of our atoll communities. The Carteret Islands, for instance, represent the world’s first known case of climate change displacement. We must act decisively and compassionately to support affected communities.”
Mr. Kato reaffirmed IOM’s long-standing commitment to working in close partnership with the Government to ensure that migration is safe, orderly, and beneficial for all Papua New Guineans.
“As the Pacific faces increasingly complex migration dynamics, IOM remains a dedicated partner to Papua New Guinea in delivering practical, people-centred solutions,” said Mr. Kato.
“We commend the Government’s leadership and reaffirm our support in strengthening policy, preparedness, and operational capacities.”
This engagement forms part of IOM’s broader mission to advance the Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) in Papua New Guinea. It also aligns with the Government’s Vision 2050 and commitment to resilient, inclusive development."
PNG to benefit from USD $42 million GEF funded program,28/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5025,"A new Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded initiatives called the Southeast Asia and the Pacific Forest Integrated Program was launched at an inception workshop in Shiang Mai, Thailand this week.
The program will be led by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
The program channels USD 42.4 million in GEF grants and USD 185 million in co-financing to three country projects in Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand and one regional coordination project, aiming to protect the primary forests of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.
It aims to improve the management of 3.2 million hectares of protected areas and over 7 million hectares of landscapes, restore 8,500 hectares of degraded ecosystems, mitigate 34 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions, and benefit nearly 20,000 people.
Country projects will be implemented by FAO and UNDP and executed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Lao PDR, the Conservation and Environment Protection Authority of Papua New Guinea, and the Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Thailand.
The Regional Coordination Project, led by IUCN and FAO with partners such as CIFOR-ICRAF and Grow Asia, will bring together countries across the region to align their strategies, share knowledge and practical experience, and catalyze coordinated action across the biome.
Stretching from Bhutan to Papua New Guinea, the Indo-Malaya Forest biome harbors one of the last major primary forest areas in the world, hosting more than 5,000 threatened species. 60% of its original vegetation is already lost, and the remaining primary forests are under pressure from unsustainable agriculture, logging, and competing land use.
Over 560 million people in the region depend on the resources provided by these forests, such as water regulation, carbon sequestration, and timber and non-timber forest products.
The aim of this GEF funded program is to maintain the integrity of these primary forests so they can deliver biodiversity, climate, and livelihood benefits to its inhabitants.
Eight countries in the region participated in the inception workshop – Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam – and further developed the program’s objectives and coordination mechanisms.
Countries and partners agreed on priority outputs that the six-year program should address, including a regional vision on primary forests, a primary forest investment forum, and a knowledge and learning hub.
The program will support the development of coherent policies, frameworks, and strategies at national and regional levels to help minimize the loss of primary forests and promote the recognition of other effective area-based conservation mechanisms in primary forest landscapes. The regional coordination project will enhance collaboration and south-south cooperation to facilitate knowledge exchange, technical support, and capacity development for improved management of primary forests across borders.
The program is one of five GEF integrated investments for primary forests under the GEF-8 replenishment. The program will connect with the GEF-8 Critical Forest Biomes Integrated Programs for the Amazon, Guinean Forests, Mesoamerica, and the Congo Basin to drive global systems change in globally important tropical forest landscapes."
Addressing dependence on meat imports,28/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5024,"The Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) is working to establish a body with statutory powers to regulate its livestock industry in the country.
The purpose is to swiftly create clear guidelines and standards because there is excessive dependence on foreign meat imports, which continue to drain the foreign reserves.
Speaking during the recent officiating of LDC public servants induction ceremony, the Managing Director Terry Koim referenced LDC as a commercial body that has no regulatory powers to regulate the livestock industry in the country.
“Right now LDC as a company is a player, but we are working to set up a regulatory authority that will serve as a referee to regulate the industry,“ he stated.
PNG spends almost K1 billion on imports to the detriment of smallholder livestock farmers.
MD Koim said according to available data, PNG spent K9.4 billion on frozen and chilled meat imports from 2012 – 2022.
This adds to the ongoing financial burden we are placing on our limited foreign reserves, and LDC is taking proactive steps to addressing this dilemma by setting up the regulatory authority that will take charge of the livestock industry.
He stated that the completion of the National Livestock Policy will form the basis to do a legislative review to create the Livestock Industry Authority, which will fill that void to regulate the livestock industry.
Referencing the recent grievances raised by smallholder poultry farmers of no proper market system in place for them, Koim stated that this was also the result of absence of regulations hence reiterating the need for the current Livestock policy and legislative reviews to be concluded.
Addressing a billion kina meat import deficit cannot be addressed by LDC alone as a company.
For PNG to become self-reliant in meat production we must first have the correct policy and regulation in place to ensure that everybody in our country knows where we are and where we are going in livestock.
MD Koim said currently the Department of Agriculture (DoA) being a custodian of all agriculture policy matters is taking the lead in engaging with stakeholders in reviewing this important policy.
He added that LDC will still be a player once the regulatory authority is established but with limited scope as its businesses will be semi-privatized through partnership with interested investors as directed by the government."

According to the TSC Chairman, Samson Wangihomie, the Teaching Service Council was established some time ago but the members stopped working when they were not paid their allowances.
“It was established sometimes ago, but then because they were not paid their allowances, they said ‘Why are we going to go and sit in there and elaborate on these issues?’ so many of them stopped coming. It’s been almost ten to fifteen years ago. So we agreed at that time and said, come and help us. So we’re going to pay them allowances,” Wangihomie said.
Members of the Teaching Service Council will be helping TSC in their capacities wherever they are located, equipped with the various policies of TSC.
“It will enhance us a lot because they will be looking into the Teaching Service Commission, they will be out there and we give them our circulars, all our policies, everything and they will reinforce the policies in their different capacities at their work places,” he added.
The council members represented different agencies including the churches who have agreed to support the council in carrying out its policies and standards from here on.

Plans to overhaul trade regulatory systems,28/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5022,"The government will shortly incorporate an electronic platform called the National Electronic Single Window (ESW) system to do trade. This was announced by the Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, who informed PNG Ports of their involvement in the new system.
“The Government will shortly be incorporating a new company which will have a new IT system called “Single Windows” to do trade. It’s a K20million investment and it’ll be anchored in PNG Customs. In the future we want to do all trade transactions online and real-time within 10mintues. I don’t want any more paperwork.”
The Single Window System is commonly used in trade, customs, and regulatory environments. It is a trade facilitation concept where traders and businesses can submit all required import, export and transit-related information and documents through a single, centralized point to fulfill all regulatory requirements. This streamlines processes, reduces paperwork, and enhances efficiency in international trade. The system then distributes this information electronically to all relevant authorities.
Minister Maru said, “PNG Ports will be a major partner. The world started on “Single Windows” 25 years ago, we are so far behind. Singapore is the leading nation now in the world and they process nine million transactions a year and that investment is coming soon.”
Traders in developed countries use the system to submit customs declarations, permits, and certificates once via a single window, which then shares the info with customs, port authorities, health inspections, and more. Citizens or companies can apply for multiple licenses or approvals through one online portal instead of dealing with each agency individually.
“This platform is to improve the efficiency of trade through electronic transactions. Whether you are in NAQIA, Customs, CIC or others you will all migrate to this system.”"

HIV Declared a National Crisis,27/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5015,"HIV has been declared a national crisis following an alarming rise in HIV cases, particularly among women and children, with mother-to-child transmission rates critically high.
Papua New Guinea is experiencing a sharp resurgence in HIV, with the estimated number of new infections doubling since 2010.
Recent data indicates that approximately 30 new HIV infections occur each day, amounting to an estimated 11,000 new cases in 2024 alone.
Worryingly, nearly half of these new cases (14 out of 30) are among children and young people aged 24 and below. This trend underscores the epidemic’s deepening impact on the next generation and highlights the urgent need for scaled-up investments in HIV prevention, testing, and treatment, particularly for children, mothers, and adolescents.
Of particular concern is the continued high rate of mother-to-child transmission. In 2024, an estimated 2,700 infants were newly infected with HIV—equivalent to seven babies per day. Most of these cases occurred because mothers were unaware of their HIV status and, as a result, did not receive the necessary antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy or breastfeeding which could have effectively prevented HIV transmission to their babies.
This major gap in maternal health highlights the urgent need to increase antenatal care uptake and expand HIV testing, counselling, and treatment for all pregnant women across Papua New Guinea.
“The rise in new HIV infections in PNG is deeply concerning. And as such, I am declaring this a National HIV Crisis,” said the Minister for Health, Elias Kapavore.
“HIV is a disease of inequality. We need to support and empower those most impacted. It is time for all of us to step-up. I personally commit to raising this issue with my fellow ministers and parliamentarians and ensuring the urgent allocation of resources to protect our people – especially the next generation of Papua New Guineans. ""
Echoing the Minister’s remarks, Acting Secretary for the Department of Health, Ken Wai, stated, “We must scale-up access to HIV testing and treatment, particularly for groups most at risk. These priority initiatives should be offered at health facilities nationwide, and will require community leadership and support.”
Dr. Sevil Huseynova, WHO Country Representative in Papua New Guinea, added, “We must strengthen our health systems to ensure universal access to HIV testing, treatment, and prevention services, especially for pregnant women and young people. This is a test of our collective commitment to health for all. WHO stands firmly with the Government of Papua New Guinea to scale up integrated, person-centered care that leaves no one behind.”
UNAIDS Country Director, Manoela Manova strongly backed the statements made by the Health Minister and Acting Secretary, placing particular emphasis on the importance of ending stigma.
“This is a shared public health crisis that demands shared responsibility. Everyone has a role to play in dismantling harmful myths, stigma, and discrimination associated with HIV. These attitudes undermine prevention, testing and treatment efforts, and hold us back from ending HIV as a public health threat in Papua New Guinea.”
UN Resident Coordinator in PNG Richard Howard reinforced the collective urgency of the moment.
“The United Nations stands in full solidarity with the Government of Papua New Guinea in confronting this national HIV crisis. We cannot afford to lose another generation to HIV. The time to act decisively - through coordinated leadership, strategic investment, and community-driven solutions - is now.”
Adding the voice of the community, Lesley Bola, Executive Director of the Key Population Advocacy Consortium (KPAC), stated, “Behind every statistic is a real person—someone’s child, friend, partner. We cannot end this crisis without meaningfully engaging the people most affected: key populations, women, youth. Community-led action is not optional - it is essential. We urge government, donors, and all partners to support scaled-up, human rights-based, community-driven HIV responses. The future of Papua New Guinea hinges on bold, urgent action - now.”
This declaration will trigger activation of a national HIV Emergency Response Plan, enhance coordination across all sectors, and prioritise investments in HIV services at every level."
Beon inmate wins Jacks design competition,27/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5014,"Professor Nicholas Garnier is the Director of the Research Centre in Social Sciences at the Divine Word University. For several years now, he has been voluntarily conducting cultural and art trainings for inmates at the Beon Correctional Institution.
On Saturday, 21st June he received a call informing him that he had won the Jacks design competition. Garnier had on behalf of inmate Sebastian Luke submitted three of his designs for the competition.
This news was overwhelming as he briefed the Jacks of PNG team of how he helped the inmate enter the competition.
On Wednesday, the team from Jacks of PNG at the Modilon road held a reception for young Sebastian and to also launch their independence campaign with their new line of clothing nationwide.
Madang Jacks Manager Silvia Ruru believed said the win by Sebastian is not just an achievement but this sends out a powerful message to everyone, that no matter who you are, second chances do come true. She stated that it was also incredible how Sebastian touched the judges without them having any knowledge of his background.
Professor Nicholas Garnier was overwhelmed and thanked Sebastian for his efforts but also told those who have gathered for the reception that Sebastian represented a group of people, the inmates of Beon, who are all behind him. As an academic he spoke about second chances and how PNG, is a nation that struggles with people having second chances. He elaborated on how best stakeholders and those in positions of authority can bring about positive changes by creating pathways for inmates and the disadvantaged to give a second go in life.
Professor Garnier thanked CIS commander Jackson Gubag for allowing him to interact with the inmates and above all, the Divine Word University.
He also congratulated Jacks of PNG in giving all Papua New Guineans the opportunity to celebrate creativity and local talent across the nation, for people even with less resources, such as the inmates.
It was an emotional moment for young Sebastian as he did not believe an inmate like him could win, he only did the designs as he had a desire for artwork. This truly paid off and now he has been awarded the K10, 000 prize money.
Professor Garnier will be assisting him to create a bank account later on to secure his funds."
Melanesian Agreement Signed,27/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5013,"Prime Minister James Marape and Autonomous Bougainville Government President Ishmael Toroama on Thursday 26 June, signed the landmark Melanesian Agreement in Port Moresby, charting a peaceful and legally defined course for the next phase of the Bougainville peace process.
The ceremony was witnessed by Moderator Sir Jerry Mateparae, ministers from both governments, members of the bipartisan Parliamentary Committee on Bougainville, senior public servants, and international partners including the United Nations and foreign diplomatic missions.
Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed the National Government’s total adherence to the constitutional process, stating that the Bougainville issue must proceed according to the provisions of the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement, now enshrined in Part XIV of the Constitution.
He acknowledged the 97.7% referendum result as clear and decisive, but emphasised that the outcome must still pass through the legal pathway:
Marape said, “The people of Bougainville have expressed their will through the referendum, and we fully respect that. However, our Constitution outlines a clear process—we must conduct consultations and present the outcome to Parliament, which holds final decision-making authority. As Prime Minister, I cannot bypass or override that process.”
The Melanesian Agreement provides a framework for the two governments to finalise consultations and prepare a report for submission to Parliament.
Prime Minister Marape described it as a collaborative and conditional document that continues the journey, rather than ends it.
“This is not an agreement to divide us—it is a roadmap to guide us through the remaining stages, grounded in constitutional integrity and mutual understanding. Our ultimate goal is to reach a destination that respects Bougainville’s aspirations while preserving the legal foundation of our nation,” stated Marape.
Drawing on the deep historical bonds between Papua New Guinea and Bougainville, Prime Minister Marape reflected on the ancestral unity of Melanesian peoples long before the creation of the modern nation in 1975:
“Before there was a constitution—before there was a country called Papua New Guinea—there were Melanesian people living in this part of the earth. We lived on the mainland, on the islands, and in the Pacific. The Melanesian concept of people is inherent—we were already sovereign in our own way.”
He stressed that Papua New Guineans and Bougainvilleans are ""people of the same stock,"" and that the constitutional process must reflect both modern governance and traditional values.
“We don’t have to fear the past or the future. Let’s jointly work together. The constitutional process is clear. Respect for the authority of our Constitution is paramount.”
Prime Minister Marape thanked the people of Bougainville for honouring the constitutional process, and made special mention of Bougainville’s historical relationship with Papua New Guinea:
“I want to say thank you to President Toroama and the people of Bougainville for respecting the Constitution of our country. The Melanesian Agreement we signed today acknowledges our shared responsibility to walk this path together, with mutual respect and in the spirit of Melanesian brotherhood.”
He reminded the people of Bougainville of PNG’s long-standing commitment, citing a pivotal moment in 1997 when members of the PNG Defence Force, including now-Minister Hon. Belden Namah, opposed the Sandline operation as an act of solidarity with Bougainville:
“Our soldiers cared for you. That was a clear statement from Papua New Guinea—that we care.”
Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed the government’s commitment to empowering Bougainville economically, referencing recent decisions to transfer full shareholding in key resource projects to the Bougainville Government.
“Giving back Panguna to you means you decide your own destiny. That is the highest form of acknowledgement from your brothers and sisters in the rest of the country.”
He pledged support for Bougainville’s sustainable development across agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and infrastructure, stating, “We are here to empower you so your people can prosper. Let us prepare Bougainville not just for political settlement, but for a thriving future.”
Prime Minister Marape acknowledged President Toroama’s pivotal role in the peace process—from being a signatory to the original 2001 Peace Agreement to now leading Bougainville through this crucial chapter:
“Your leadership at this crucial time is no accident. You bring historical wisdom and strength to a very delicate and important process.”
He also paid tribute to Sir Jerry Mateparae for his longstanding role as moderator: “Sir Jerry has been with us since 1997. His calm leadership and presence have helped us maintain focus and discipline throughout this journey. We deeply appreciate his service to both Bougainville and PNG.”
Looking ahead to the submission of the final consultation report by June 30, Prime Minister Marape assured both Bougainvilleans and Papua New Guineans that the journey would continue in peace, unity, and trust.
“Let no one fear. We remain united in purpose. As one people, we are navigating this process together—with humility, with care, and with faith in our Constitution and in each other.”"

Agreement signed for Nadzab cargo hub,26/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5008,"The National Airports Corporation (NAC) and AFIA PNG Limited (AHA PNG), a 100% nationally owned import-export enterprise, today signed a landmark 40-year Lease Agreement, paving the way for the establishment of an integrated Air Freight Cargo Terminal at Nadzab Tomodachi International Airport (NTIA) specifically for storing and exporting agriculture and marine products.
This historic agreement represents the first lease of its kind at Nadzab for a local import-export business, positioning the airport as a key gateway for facilitating market access and economic opportunity across Papua New Guinea. The initiative enables AFIA PNG to develop and operate a modern ""Cargo Terminal and Systems"" that will support the movement of both dry and perishable goods, offering a transformative supply chain solution for rural producers.
Earlier in April this year, AFIA PNG accepted NAC's initial lease offer—a critical milestone that confirmed both parties' commitment to this shared vision. With the final lease now signed, attention now turns to implementing a nationwide airfreight network that connects buying points in rural communities with domestic and international markets via Nadzab.
AFIA PNG's platform will allow for streamlined collection, storage, and shipment of fresh produce and seafood. The model aims to increase income for farmers and fishermen, support food security, and unlock access to high-value export markets.
Dominic Kaumu, Acting CEO of NAC, said, ""The National Government has made major capital investments in the airport infrastructure at Nadzab. The current phase is about unlocking revenue from that infrastructure, through land leases, business partnerships, service concessions, and public-private co-developments.''
""We're proud to support projects that unlock new value chains for PNG producers. This agreement signals the beginning of Nadzab's evolution as a secondary international gateway, equipped for both passenger and cargo operations that support our nation's economic growth, "" He added.
Mr Kaumu also stated that the Lease Agreement aligns with NAC's broader strategy to diversify revenue  streams and strengthen its commercial position.
""This is a tangible step in expanding our non-aeronautical business. By unlocking long-term value from airport land, we're positioning our airports to be self-sustaining to support operational requirements.""
Jerry Karl, Project Director for AFIA PNG, shared, ""This is about enabling our people. PNG's rural population has the resources and resilience—what they need are the right enablers. By signing this lease, we're one step closer to connecting our farmers and fishermen to the world.""
""That's the kind of legacy we want to build at 50 years of independence.”"

United action required to stop unregulated alluvial mining,26/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5000,"Community leaders, landowners, and small-scale miners around the country have been called to stand together and tackle growth of unregulated alluvial mining across the country.
The Papua New Guinea Chamber of Resources & Energy (PNG CORE) in a statement said unregulated alluvial mining poses a serious threat to the mining industry, local communities, and legitimate small-scale miners.
According to PNG CORE, recent reports have highlighted a surge in illegal mining practices, gold smuggling, and a decline in lawful alluvial gold production, raising alarm across the sector.
As the peak body representing the minerals sector, PNG CORE is deeply concerned about the environmental damage, social disruption, and economic harm caused by these unregulated activities.
Such operations not only endanger surrounding communities but also erode sustainable development opportunities and fair competition for compliant miners.
PNG CORE urges community leaders and landowners to take proactive steps to protect their land and people’s future.
This includes refusing access to illegal miners, reporting suspicious activities to the authorities, and verifying all mining engagements with the MRA before proceeding.
Small-scale miners are also strongly encouraged to pursue legal operations by securing the necessary licenses and permits for machinery use.
Legal compliance ensures safer, environmentally responsible mining practices and contributes meaningfully to both community welfare and national development.
Addressing illegal and unregulated alluvial mining requires a coordinated, multi-stakeholder approach focused on formalisation, environmental stewardship, community health, and strengthened governance.
In response to these developments, the Mineral Resources Authority (MRA) has issued a public stop-work notice targeting unauthorised alluvial mining operations involving heavy machinery.
This enforcement followed confirmed reports of individuals and companies conducting illegal mining activities in designated alluvial mining districts and other regions.
MRA emphasised that these operations violate the Mining Act 1992 and warned that further breaches would result in legal consequences.
Echoing this regulatory stance, Mining Minister Rainbo Paita issued a strong warning to all operators. “Operate within your permits or leave.”
Minister Paita reaffirmed the government’s zero-tolerance approach to illegal mining, stressing that all mining activities must comply with the terms of their permits and licenses.
He emphasised that failure to do so undermines the integrity of the sector and will not be tolerated."

SARV Victims’ Families Receive Support,25/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4995,"Two women who were victims of sorcery accusation-related violence (SARV) have died in Simbu Province, with the PNG Tribal Foundation stepping in to support their grieving families in what the Foundation describes as a continuing humanitarian crisis.
One of the women, a 40-year-old mother of three from Piau village, Tabare LLG, Sinesine Yongomugl, died last week after suffering from what relatives described as a stress-related illness.
Her son had been brutally tortured and killed in March 2024 after being accused of sorcery following the death of a prominent man in the area. Their home was destroyed in the aftermath, displacing over 150 people from the community.
“The emotional trauma she endured after losing her son and home was too much. She became ill and passed away,” a spokesperson from PNG Tribal Foundation said.
To help the family lay her to rest, the Foundation provided over K1,500 for the haus krai, food, and coffin expenses over the weekend.
In a separate case, a 35-year-old woman from Kombumogo village, Kerowagi, who was a key eyewitness in an ongoing SARV case before the National Court in Mt Hagen, also died over the weekend. She had been living in a care centre since September 2023 when her house and gardens were destroyed following another SARV incident.
She died due to childbirth complications at Mt Hagen General Hospital.
“She was one of our key witnesses. We had been supporting her during the court process and recently gave K500 to help transport her body back to her village,” said the spokesperson.
PNG Tribal Foundation President GT Bustin confirmed the organisation had been assisting the witness throughout the legal process, including providing police fuel, filing paperwork, gathering eyewitness accounts, and supplying food.
Bustin added that the Foundation is now also supporting SARV victims in Jiwaka Province, where a volunteer is collecting witness statements from Jimi and South Wahgi districts, following a request from the State Prosecutor during a court session in Mt Hagen last Thursday. The case has been adjourned to July.
In addition to SARV response work, the Foundation is providing support to a family in a child sexual abuse case involving a four-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by her biological father.
The case, now before the Simbu District Court, saw the suspect remanded at Barawagi Prison, while the victim remains in a safe house. Medical reports were obtained from Mt Hagen Provincial Hospital last Friday.
The PNG Tribal Foundation continues to play a vital role in supporting survivors of violence and those caught in vulnerable circumstances, especially in areas where access to justice and care remains limited."

Government urged to implement the EITI Standard to Avoid Grey-Listing,25/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4993,"The newly appointed executives of the PNG Resource Governance Coalition (PNGRGC) have called on the government to prioritise the reforms under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) standard to help prevent PNG being grey-listed by the Financial Action Taskforce (FATF).
The members of the PNGRGC appointed their 2025 Council at the recently concluded Annual General Meeting on Thursday 19th June 2025 at the Gateway Hotel, Port Moresby.
“Reforms pursued under the EITI standard related to governance and accountability over resource utilisation can contribute towards ensuring PNG is not grey-listed by FATF. Making information available on the owners of a company through a publicly available Beneficial Ownership Registry, is a measure recommended by both EITI and FATF. PNG has already met the requirement under EITI to ensure all extractive companies disclose who their owners are, so the government should extend the same approach to the remainder of companies so as to meet the FATF requirements,” said Ms. Arianne Kassman representing Transparency International PNG, President elect of the PNGRGC.
The PNGRGC is the peak body representing civil society interests in the Papua New Guinea Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (PNGEITI), which is a process whereby extractive companies disclose payments made to the State, and revenue agencies report payments received by industry, as well as having to comply with other standards related to sub-national transfers, contract transparency, and related to gender opportunities and environmental accountability.
The PNGRGC is a registered association whose members are themselves registered associations, working to promote good governance in the extractive sector of Papua New Guinea.
The following organisations are members of the PNGRGC Council:
• President – Transparency International Papua New Guinea (TIPNG) Inc.
• Vice President – Center for Environmental Law and Community Rights (CELCOR) Inc.
• Secretary – Consultative Implementation & Monitoring Council (CIMC)
• Treasurer – Papua New Guinea Institute of National Affairs (INA)
Membership for the PNGRGC is open for formally registered associations and forms can be collected by contacting the PNGRGC Secretariat Officer, Ms. Michelle Mondia, on pngrgcadm@gmail.com or calling 3234917 and speaking with the PNGRGC office."

Yangoru-Saussia launches 9km road project,23/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4965,"A groundbreaking ceremony for a 9km road project to connect Kwarabri to Ambuganja in Yangoru-Saussia District, East Sepik Province was recently officiated by the Member for Yangoru Saussia, Richard Maru.
For the past 50 years, the people of Kwarabri in the Yangoru-Saussia District longed to see tangible development to improve access to services daily. Changes in leadership were a contributing factor, delaying important infrastructure that would enable this. However, this will now be a story of the past as development is beginning to hit this area through the launching of a new road. This is a historic milestone for Maru’s people, 50 years on.
Maru said K400,000 funding was allocated to the project contractor two months ago. This will enable the construction phase to begin without delay. He urged locals to support the project’s construction phase so that it can be delivered in time.
Landowner Joseph Lekiemani said law and order issues are a common challenge faced in the area; therefore, the construction of this road will enable police visibility, which will then mitigate this issue.
Maru added that other development plans will include the construction of a bridge and the implementation of two new generators. Maru made a commitment to complete these developments before September of this year."
Proper land titles key for Sepik Plain SEZ project,23/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4963,"The Sepik Plain Special Economic Zone will commence once land titles are secured, enabling investors to invest, says Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru.
Maru said when giving an update on the progress of the Sepik Plain SEZ in Wewak, East Sepik Province.
He said this is a fully funded program under the Marape-Rosso government aimed at making Sepik one of the major economic zones in the country.
The Sepik Plain SEZ will cover a million hectares of land within the Sepik Plain, which includes Yangoru Saussia, Angoram, Ambunti/Drekikier, Maprik, Wosera Gawi, and further to Telefomin in West Sepik Province.
“The zone will include major large-scale agriculture developments focusing on oil palm, and include industrial areas, a township, and colleges.
“Unfortunately, most of the land is owned by the people. Under my watch, no land must be taken from landowners. What we must do is help meet the cost of surveying the land, getting ILGs, and giving state titles to the village people. When we do that, our people will not lose their land,” Maru said.
He said this will enable local landowners to be less marginalized, and land will not be taken away from them.
Minister Maru stated that the challenge now is to give proper state land titles to the landowners, improve infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and power supply, before involving investors.
The Minister added that work is in progress to develop the Hayfill airport in Maprik. This airport will play a key role in bringing investors through the implementation phase of the Sepik SEZ project.
The Sepik Plain SEZ coordinator, Fantson Yaninen, said this project will add value to Papua New Guineans through utilizing their land for investments.

PNGFA seals MOU to progress downstream processing,23/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4956,"The PNG Forest Authority has been given the authority to venture into commercial forestry through its business arm, PNG Diwai Holding Limited.
In pursuing this further, the PNGFA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of International Trade and Investment (DITI) and PNG Diwai Holdings Ltd (PNGDHL) on Friday, June 20.
The MOU enables the establishment and Development of the Pilot Integrated Forestry Special Economic Zone (FSEZ).
PNGFA becomes the first sector agency to partner with DITI.
DITI secretary, Jacinta Manua stated: “We are in full agreement with this MOU. This is the first time we are signing this with a sector agency, and so it is very important for us. The department is pushing the agenda of Special Economic Zones,” said Manua.
The MOU seals four activities: Downstream processing, Forest Plantation Development, establishment of Forest Industrial Parks in four strategic provinces, and carbon offset projects to be undertaken under a thorough process.
PNGFA will focus on downstream processing and industrial parks for a start, with progress made so far. PNGFA managing director, John Mosoro, said the signing is a key achievement, paving the way for all raw products to be processed onshore and exported overseas.
“Now we're starting to look at this seriously, will phase out logging and start building facilities to go into full-scale downstream processing,” said Mosoro.
“For forestry we want the downstream processing as our 50-year achievement going forward next 50 years to have downstream processing facilities in the country and we phase out log exports completely.” (inset clip)
Mosoro stated that a site has been identified in Central Province for a processing plant, with water and electricity available – a key requirement, with discussions in progress.
As per the MOU, the DITI, as a partner in this signing, will focus on sectoral investment growth by creating an enabling business environment under a FSEZ model to attract more foreign investment.
“We are working with the sector agency.  Forestry has been in business for a long time, and they have all the information about the industry itself. We come at the back-end of it, we play support to PNGFA,” said Manua.
A Technical Working Group has been set up to look into the action plan to drive forward the downstream processing initiative.
“We want to move as fast as possible; we want to say that in the forestry sector, we now have an action plan that talks about downstream processing,” added Manua.
She is urging other sectors to also work with the DITI and embrace downstream processing."
Police vehicles damaged,22/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4950,"Three police vehicles that operate and serve the people of both NCD and Central provinces were damaged by an alleged group of Goilalas who reside at different locations in Port Moresby.
National Capital District Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab confirmed that two Force 10 vehicles and one vehicle from Motu Koita police were damaged on Thursday and Saturday.
He said the two Force 10 vehicles, which were assisting the Central police officers at Fifteen Mile police station, responded to another incident at Bomana in the early hours of Friday and were attacked by a group of armed men alleged to be from Goilala.
""It was night, and the attackers were hiding in the dark when the vehicle got bogged down and was trying to pull out when they stoned the vehicle's windscreens. Help was called for other police units to assist, who responded and rescued the officers and the vehicles. Some suspects were picked up a day later and are now in police custody. They will be interviewed and charged accordingly,"" Met. Supt Simatab said.
The other incident happened on Saturday morning at Badihagwa, where the Motu Koita police bus was stoned by an alleged group of Goilala men. He said one suspect was picked up by members of the community and is now detained in the police cell for questioning.
Simatab said the police vehicles had been helping in policing the city, and with the three vehicles damaged, it will now decrease the police presence in the city.
""I want to call on the public to respect public properties, such as police vehicles. The vehicles are paid for or hired with the people's money, and they help provide police services to the community. With the damage done, we will now have less police presence, which will lead to an increase in law and order problems.
“My call now is for everyone to work with the police to identify those who are stoning the Force 10 vehicles at Bomana and the Motu Koita bus at Badihagwa. We want the community to help us report those individuals damaging public assets,"" Met Supt. Simatab said.
He said the vehicles are in the workshop for maintenance."
New electric trucks introduced to PNG,22/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4949,"In an effort to reduce its carbon footprint, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has imported five electric trucks; one for Port Moresby and four for the industrial city of Lae.
This was made possible through a partnership with Express Freight Management.
This means the company is the first in PNG to use electric trucks that have zero tailpipe emissions, no engine noise that would contribute to noise pollution, and because they depend on electricity, there will be no need for fossil fuels.
The company launched its new electric trucks at the Lae depot warehouse on Friday, 20 June 2025.
Imported from China, one electric truck will be used in Port Moresby, while four will operate in PNG’s industrial hub of Lae city.
CCEP PNG’s commercial director, Tim Solly, outlined that the introduction of these state-of-the-art vehicles into their logistics operation alludes to their bold commitment to a cleaner, greener future.
The company is expecting five more electric trucks to bring their total fleet to 10. The electric trucks have a battery capacity of 500 kilowatts, and can be charged for 6 hours at 60AMP before they can be used to distribute products from CCEP sites to customer sites.
“The infrastructure around charging was one of the big considerations that we had, and it was a concern for us at the beginning,” said Solly. “But we end up charging them on EFM’s site and we have the ability – if power does go off – to use our own genset.
“So, the reality is, we do have the ability to make sure they are fully charged.
“In addition to that, they can go about 300km per charge, anyway. They are much more efficient and effective than fuel-based vehicles.”
Managing director of Express Freight Management, Robert Howden, echoed the sentiment, saying together, they are setting a new benchmark for logistics in Papua New Guinea.
“Working with Coca-Cola has been positive,” he stated, “considering this is a groundbreaking initiative for them. Here we are today with a truck that says ‘100 percent electric’. It’s taken time, it’s taken planning, and results so far, have been better than expected. So, we’re very happy.
“We are making a difference, and we are cutting down on carbon emissions.”
There are two charging stations with the capacity to charge two electric trucks at the same time. One is in Port Moresby while the other is in Lae.
Depending on the load, terrain and distance, an electric truck can potentially run for five days before requiring a charge."
A new start for police reservists,22/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4948,"Reservist police officers have a long history in the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, dating back 41 years to when the police department started recruiting reservist officers.
On Saturday, June 21 some former police reservists, who are now politicians, businessmen, lawyers, and prominent figures in their respective communities, were present alongside Assistant Commissioner of Police NCD/Central and Southern Benjamin Turi and Joseph Puri, respectively, at Saraga Police Post to share ideas on how they can work together to assist the regular police officers.
Coordinator of the Reservist Program in NCD/Central, Ruben Giusu, who spearheaded the gathering, saw more than one hundred reservists who were working in NCD and Central show up to demonstrate their support for him and the commanders, indicating that they are ready to work.
ACP NCD/Central was pleased to see the officers show up, acknowledge them, and pledge support to collaborate in strengthening police manpower in the command.
He mentioned that they now have a coordinator and designated office space, allowing everyone to report to the coordinator and work alongside the police station commanders and regular officers to maintain law and order in the community.
While acknowledging them, he also mentioned some of the outstanding police reservist officers who had made significant arrests and secured convictions in high-profile cases.
Giusu said he wants that to continue. He welcomed everyone back to the command and looks forward to working with them.
ACP Southern Command Joseph Puri also stated that since the NCD/Central Command shares a border with his command, he is prepared to collaborate with the reservist officers to enhance manpower in his command due to the road connections now linking other provinces.
Chief Inspector Ruben Giusu, while acknowledging the commanders and the police reservist officers, also took time to share what he will do to help them when he settles down in the office.
He said there are many things to do to bring back all trained reservists because they are part of the RPNGC and have sworn an oath to wear the uniform.
He challenged the reservists that they are still members of the police force, and the bad things the officers do that are captured in the media, which also paint a bad image of all police reservists."

PNG childhood educators acquire skills under PALM scheme,21/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4944,"A pilot program in the Northern Territory, Australia, is providing 14 childhood educators from Papua New Guinea opportunities to acquire new skills and enhance their existing qualifications.
The educators have been working at early childhood centres in the regional centres of Alice Springs and Katherine under the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme’s early childhood education and care (ECEC) pilot.
The ECEC pilot is part of the Australian Government’s commitment to tackling Australia’s workforce shortages in rural and regional areas. It also ensures workers develop long term skills and expertise that will strengthen the domestic labour markets back home.
The Papua New Guinean educators are graduating this month from a preparation program, which builds on their existing qualifications in early education to support their transition into an Australian workplace.
PALM scheme worker and educator, Shirley Mogi says the pilot provides the opportunity to build on existing experience in and knowledge of the sector.
“Here in Australia, you have something already set for the early childhood level, whereas for Papua New Guinea we have a lot of private schools, so everyone comes with their own philosophy, their own approach to early childhood.”
“We need human resources to go back and educate the young people of PNG and for Australia to be very welcoming to open their doors to accommodate. It’s a really big honour for us,” she said.
The educators will work in childcare centres for up to four years under the long-term stream of the PALM scheme.
There are currently over 2,000 PALM workers from PNG in Australia working in sectors including meat processing, agriculture, and aged care."
Marape describes new Alotau–POM route as “Tourism Highway”,21/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4943,"Following the arrival of the first vehicles from Alotau to Port Moresby, Prime Minister James Marape described the Alotau–Port Moresby route as an “iconic tourism highway” in the making.
“This is more than a road — it’s a pathway to tourism, agriculture, fisheries, hospitality, forestry, and other rural industries.”
He said while the highway is still in its early development phase and not fully sealed, it represents a major breakthrough in national infrastructure.
“This is the first-cut stage. Over time, we will build it into a world-class sealed highway. For now, it is already operational — and people are using it.”
To safeguard this progress, Prime Minister Marape confirmed that new law enforcement infrastructure will be built along the highway as part of the broader development vision.
“We intend to include police stations along strategic sections of our highways,” he said.
“These roads must be safe and secure for our people. They are meant for business, tourism, and community development — not for criminal activity.”
He also revealed a new land policy initiative being developed with the Department of Lands and the Department of Commerce and Industry to ensure landowners along the highways can register their land and use it as bankable collateral to start businesses.
“We want our people to go into commercial agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and hospitality. That’s how we convert road infrastructure into economic opportunity,” he said.
“We are already seeing successful ventures — like the export of mud crabs from Central direct to Singapore — and we want to see more of that.”
Prime Minister Marape assured the nation that construction is continuing on remaining links, with less than 30 kilometres left to complete the Port Moresby–Alotau connection.
“It is my intention to personally drive the full stretch of the highway from Port Moresby to Alotau in August this year.”
He also dismissed recent allegations by the Opposition regarding project mismanagement.
“An independent audit is currently underway into the conduct of Works, but that will not stop our determination. Our vision is clear: to connect the country and empower our people through infrastructure.”
“This is our blueprint. From the Highlands to the coast, from West Sepik to Milne Bay, roads are going in. Let us use them to lift our people out of poverty and into prosperity.”"

""NCD being the leading Province in Papua New Guinea, it has to take the lead in development and services delivery, and NCDPHA is leading the way by embracing ICT,"" he added.
""Availability of Social Media platforms has enabled the spread of misinformation on information related to health, with the availability of NCDPHA's official website, factual information can easily be sourced from it, and this will instill confidence in them,"" Dr Albert emphasized further.
NCD Governor Powes Parkokp pledged support for the future development of NCDPHA.
Mr Parkop acknowledged the NCDPHA’s management for the effort. NCDC and NCDPHA will work together to provide effective health service delivery in NCD and Motu Koitabu communities.

Milne Bay successfully linked to Port Moresby via road,21/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4939,"The first four vehicles from Milne Bay province arrived in Port Moresby yesterday, signifying the successful completion of the Magi Highway Missing Link.
Works Department staff from Milne Bay and Provincial Administration officers drove 13 hours, arriving in Port Moresby at 11am yesterday morning.
Milne Bay is now physically connected to the national economy, enhancing administrative service delivery, tourism, trade, and logistics.
Works and Highways Minister, Soaln Mirism welcomed this historical achievement in the government’s Connect PNG program.
This road now links a critical missing link that is part of the Southern Region Corridor Connectivity plan, which aims to connect Milne Bay Province to the National Capital District via the Central Province
This road will unlock the full economic potential of that region, which has a lot of potential in agriculture, tourism, and petroleum, like the Mailu prospects, which is at the feasibility study stage.
The missing link stretches across Kupiano in Abau District and connects with Boal/Kilakila in the Alotau District of Milne Bay Province
Under Phase 1 (2020-2027) of the Connect PNG program, the government aims to connect all the unlinked provincial capitals to the national road network, starting with Port Moresby to Alotau, apart from Kerema town.
According to Works and Highways Minister, Solan Mirism, this road connection has been a long standing National infrastructure challenge since independence and was relieved that it has been realized in time for the 50th Golden Jubilee Anniversary celebration.
“From Bautama (Central Province) to East Cape (Alotau), which is almost 600kms, completes the Magi Highway. This highway is now a strategic road which will have a greater socio-economic impact on the road side communities. This highway embraces National integration and will boost economic activity, efficient service delivery, improve tourism, trade and logistics,” Mirisim stated.
The connectivity will also see cost reduction especially on freight and travel, improving access for local produce to markets and increase number of SMEs in Central and Milne Bay Province, respectively.
In terms of security and sovereignty, this road places the region to be a strategic part of the country on border monitor, emergency disaster response, and mobility.
The minister also provided a brief of future plans for this road.
“Whilst we celebrate this achievement, full road sealing works will commence to bring the road to an all weather standard road.
“A formal launching ceremony is being prepared to formally launch this historic milestone achievement by connecting Alotau to Port Moresby which will be Commissioned by the Prime Minister and the Governor General.”"

Rarau said they are currently doing budwood garden construction and nursery construction with the capacity of the budwood garden at 360 per ward, containing 18 varieties of cocoa. The nursery capacity for each ward is 10 000 per ward. The nurseries for the two LLGs will have a 20 000 capacity and they will be establishing seven nurseries in each district, six for the wards and one for the LLG.
“After the farmers have planted cocoa in their fields, we will roll out the construction of the cocoa solar dryer which includes a storage facility and the dryer,” said Rarau.
She encouraged people from the wards to participate in the program so their livelihood in the communities can be improved.
CCB Field Officer Cornelius Wangun said “the total targeted farmers in each ward is 500 and they will be supplied with 625 cocoa seedlings per farmer. In Marmar ward, we have a nursery capacity of 10 000 seedlings which will be restocked until all the farmers are supplied.”
Acting Pomio District Rural Development Officer Wesley Palor said the cocoa production in the district is increasing and having the program will help boost production.
Palor said the farmers in the community will also be trained on nursery management practices, block lining and management, filling poly bags, shading and drainage.
Meanwhile, the Center of Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI) is also facilitating financial literacy training in the communities from the 16th to the 29th of June as part of the program."
RISE builds female leaders in PNG,20/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4931,"Education is proving to be a powerful catalyst for social change as young women across Papua New Guinea (PNG) are being empowered through the RISE program — a mentoring and leadership initiative supported by City Pharmacy Limited (CPL) Foundation Inc.
The program, which began earlier this year, specifically targets Grade 11 and 12 students, guiding them through eight months of personal and professional development.
With workshops running monthly, the initiative pairs 20 students from Tokarara Secondary School with mentors who help them build career awareness, develop leadership skills, and prepare for tertiary education or employment.
RISE’s success is made possible through a strategic partnership with CPL Foundation Inc., led by Sir Mahesh Patel who believes that “the future is female.”
This partnership builds on CPL’s broader commitment to women’s empowerment in health, education, and economic opportunities.
“Our girls need to know they belong in boardrooms, businesses, and leadership roles,” Sir Mahesh said during the third workshop held last weekend.
The sessions have also featured inspiring speakers such as Dame Meg Taylor, Dr Cecilia Nembou, and Winnie Kiap —each bringing a wealth of experience and encouragement to the mentees.
These trailblazing women have shared real-world insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for young women in PNG.
For many participants, completing high school is an uphill battle, often made harder by societal expectations and economic hardship.
Programs like RISE not only provide guidance—they inspire resilience, confidence, and a belief in a brighter future.
Three workshops remain before the program’s graduation ceremony in October 2025."
Police to monitor highway following death,20/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4930,"A twenty-five-year-old man of a mixed parentage of Goilala and East Sepik was murdered yesterday morning at Kuriva along the Hiritano Highway.
Angry relatives then set up a road block, preventing the flow of traffic along this section of the Highway.
Central Provincial Police Commander Chief Inspector Joseph Salle stated that Central police were notified of the roadblock attended to it.
The body of the deceased was then taken to his residential area at Panava Bridge along the Hiritano Highway.
""My officers had called on the relatives of the deceased to refrain from taking the law into their own hands, but must cooperate with the police to ensure that those involved face justice. I am also calling on the traveling public to take precautions when traveling along that section of the road. Police units will also be deployed along the highway to monitor the situation, Salle Said.
He also thanked his officers for their quick response, which led to no serious damage being done to other properties. He said the cause of death is still unknown.
Salle added that the police units on the ground conducted awareness for the people living along the highway, advising them not to block the road in future because it is a National Highway."
Growing concerns of drug smuggling into NCD,20/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4927,"Security agencies, airline companies, and customers are urged to work together to combat the illegal smuggling of cannabis through planes into Port Moresby, says Deputy Commissioner of Police Special Operations Donald Yamasombi.
Following reports of arrests and seizure of cannabis from different terminals at Jackson's International Airport, Yamasombi said this is now a significant security concern for the constabulary.
""If our airline companies are transporting marijuana from villages to Port Moresby, what guarantee will there be to transport it out of PNG to other countries? Our security companies, the airline companies, customs, and all the agencies must now work together to strengthen this. They are bringing the drug in larger quantities, as per reports received,"" DCP Yamasombi said.
He said last week, a couple and a taxi driver from Hela province were arrested and charged for having in their possession 13 kilograms of marijuana that came in from the Highlands region.
Recently, on Wednesday, about 10 kilograms of marijuana were brought in from Tapini on a Twin Hotter charter flight to Port Moresby. The marijuana was left unattended at the terminal when police arrived at the scene, but no one claimed the bags, which the police officers took to the Drug Squad office for destruction.
DCP Yamasombi further added that officers working at the airports and some of the police officers are involved in this activity.
He made reference to an incident on May 5th, 2025, where a large quantity of marijuana was brought in by Air Sanga that was at the terminal when police officers from the Drug Squad were tipped off.
They visited the scene and confirmed that more than five bags of drugs were left unattended at the terminal.
Police officers from the Drug Squad were investigating a previous case where some police officers from the Seven Mile Police Station were involved in conveying a huge amount of drugs that were never brought to the Drug Squad office for profiling and labeling as exhibits when they came across the May 5th incident.
Police investigations into the May 5th incident further led to the involvement of NAC officers.
On May 14th, 2025, NAC officers took eight marijuana bags to the Drug Squad office. According to sources, more than eight bags were removed at the airport but the NAC officers only brought in eight.
""Police officers are investigating that, and arrests will be made soon. This arrest will lead to the arrest of those who are party to the movement of these drugs. It had been happening in the past, and nothing had been done, so my officers will try their best to make sure they get all those involved charged.
If it means arresting the airline companies, it will happen because they failed to do proper checks before loading the goods. Port Moresby is now full of drug addicts because the authorities are participating in moving drugs to Port Moresby.
I want to commend the officers from the Drug Squad, NCD police, and all those who were involved in information gathering to build a case that will now be used to monitor the airline companies and other transport companies,” Yamasombi added."
PPCC pleased with Momase Communications inquiry,20/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4925,"The Permanent Parliamentary Committee on Communications began their regional inquiry with the Momase region in Madang Wednesday. The consultation concluded yesterday. The committee chaired by Marsh Narewec, member for Wau-Waria is open assisted by Ricky Morris, member for Alotau Open and Robert Naguri Bogia Open member.
They probed media organizations, stakeholders and the members of the public about challenges faced by media workers and explored ways to journalism education, regulation and professional practice. The inquiries aim to shape and promote responsible, ethical and quality journalism.
A decent crowd gathered at Divine Word University’s Sir Peter Barter Auditorium to participate in the first tour of the Permanent Parliamentary Committee on Communications in Madang. NBC Radio Station Manager for Madang, Macklay Bel, shared perspectives on misinformation and disinformation from the point of view of journalists in the province, and how the government can create and support policies which enable adequate training for journalists going into the workforce. A call was made for cadetship programs which was practiced in the past and the result was that the industry had more refined journalists.
In coping with technological advances and regulating online platforms the Provincial Police Commander Acting Superintendent Robert Baim and his team of officers were called to the panel to shed light on how they have been monitoring cybercrime within their jurisdiction. This included the process in which it took to get warrants to mobile phone companies to search for information and revert to police.
PPC Baim said, “There have been numerous reports on cybercrime in Madang, however, the challenges faced at the moment is getting to the next stage of arrests and prosecuting,” he said.
“Complainants usually settle out of court after reporting, which is out of our hands, resulting in the cases not proceeding onto the next stage.”
“There has to be a policy in place to prevent out of court settlements or tampering with suspects who have reported. Another major issue is getting necessary training for our cybercrimes officers,” the PPC stated.
The committee made a note of all these, to include in their recommendations to Parliament.
Two second year journalism students from Divine Word University were also invited to make presentations on awareness of cybercrime in schools and having it included in the curriculum in primary schools. The students and Mr Bel have been invited by the committee to travel to Port Moresby to properly present their submissions before the committee.
The PPCC Chairman said the inquiry was a success due to the significant feedback they received over the past two days. The committee now travels to Mission Resort in Jiwaka Province to hold the highlands leg of the consultation forum from June 22nd to 24th."
Deshbesh Proposes Livestock Sector Reform,19/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4923,"Deshbesh Enterprise Limited, through its subsidiary Deshbesh Agro Farm, has reaffirmed its commitment to advancing Papua New Guinea’s livestock sector by presenting three targeted policy proposals during the National Livestock Policy stakeholder consultation for the Southern Region this week.
Company representative Mindu Karu outlined a transformative plan that aims to boost sector productivity by 40% and create 15,000 jobs within five years.
The proposals include immediate government interventions such as a 50% input subsidy on quality animal feed, tax exemptions on imported breeding stock and veterinary supplies, and streamlined export processes with a 72-hour clearance system.
Long-term strategies involve establishing three regional meat and dairy processing hubs under public-private partnerships, coupled with five-year tax holidays to attract investment.
A third recommendation focuses on stakeholder collaboration through a Southern Region Livestock Alliance to pool resources and enhance market access for smallholders.
Export–Import Coordinator Mizanur Rahman emphasized Deshbesh’s commitment to supporting policy development by sharing data and technical expertise.
He noted that the company’s sustainable practices, derived from addressing on-ground challenges, have increased profitability by over 30% and can serve as a national model for growth and resilience in the livestock industry."

Simbu LLG Election Preparation Faces Hurdles,19/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4917,"As Simbu Province makes final preparations for the 2025 Local Level Government (LLG) Elections, with campaign activities in full swing, concerns have been raised about the availability of funds and resources to ensure the LLG elections are concluded successfully.
Election Manager of Chimbu Province, Reverend Tom Siune confirmed the province is ready for the electoral process, with nominated candidates currently undergoing an 11-week campaign period ahead of polling day set for July 12, 2025.
“Simbu is ready for the LLG elections, but we are struggling with funding and logistical support,” said Rev Siune.
“We have been asked to implement a mobile polling system, but without adequate resources, that will be very difficult.”
Rev Siune is now appealing to the Simbu Provincial Government and the six District Development Authorities (DDAs) to step in and assist with logistics and operational costs.
“If no support comes soon, we may be forced to cancel polling in some remote wards because we simply won't have the means to reach them,” he warned.
Among the highlights of the upcoming elections is the record number of 48 female candidates from Simbu, the highest in the Highlands region.
“We are proud to see this level of female participation,” said Anthonia Nilkare, one of the senior electoral officers overseeing activities across the province.
Electoral staff including Charlie Wangaid, Thomas Muabala, and James Dom continue their duties across the six districts to ensure that systems are in place ahead of July.
The electoral team remains hopeful that with timely local government support, the elections can proceed smoothly and all 351 wards will be reached on polling day.
There are 20 LLGs—18 rural and 2 urban—and 317 original ward areas in Simbu. Following a recent proclamation, 34 new wards have been added, bringing the total to 351. These newly declared wards are located primarily in Kundiawa-Gembogl, Chuave, Salt-Nomane, and Gumine districts."
Drugs slip past airport security,19/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4916,"A 57-year-old woman and two men from Tari, Hela Province were arrested yesterday in Port Moresby for having in possession eleven bags of wrapped marijuana weighing 13kg in the nation's capital.
They were caught while traveling in a taxi from Jackson Airport to their designated residence.
National Capital District Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab confirmed that the three are now in custody and will appear in court anytime this week.
According to the police brief, the three were sighted at the airport acting suspiciously, and the security guards quickly alerted the police when they got into the cab and drove out of the airport.
Superintendent Simatab said the security officers who tipped off the police also followed the taxi while communicating with the police.
Police personnel from the Vision City Cop Shop stopped and searched the taxi, confirming the presence of marijuana inside. He stated that the officers then brought the three individuals to the cop shop, where they were interrogated and confirmed that the marijuana belonged to them.
“I want to thank the security officers at the airport and the police officers at Vision City for their well-organized communication that led to the apprehension of the three. I want to see more of that from the private sector, especially security guards. When the public and the police work together, those criminal-minded people will not have a place in the community. When we are honest in our work, we will see such results in what we are doing daily,” Simatab said.
He also confirmed that people are bringing drugs from their respective provinces by plane, but get away because of poor coordination between the police and security at the airports. He said that with this arrest, it was well coordinated, and the command will want to see more of such arrests.
The three were charged under Section 63 (1) of the Controlled Substances Act 2021 for knowingly having in their possession eleven bags of wrapped marijuana."
First-ever Resource Recovery Centre launched,18/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4913,"A new Resource Recovery Centre (the first of its kind in Papua New Guinea) will be built in Roku, on the outskirts of Port Moresby under a landmark partnership between Australia and TWM Group.
Australian High Commissioner, Mr Ewen McDonald joined Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, and others to break ground on the new Resource Recovery Centre.
Supported through the long-running Incentive Fund, the project, valued at PGK23.6 million (AUD10 million), will be delivered on a 50/50 cost-sharing basis between the Australian Government and TWM Group.
It marks the first time in the Incentive Fund’s 25-year history that the two governments have partnered directly with the private sector.
The project reflects a long-term commitment by TWM Group to deliver the nation’s first fully integrated waste management facility.
The addition of the Resource Recovery Centre will close the loop on its waste management system with a focus on prioritising the reuse, repurposing and recycling of waste - reserving safe disposal as a last resort.
Once operational the new facility will have the capacity to transform up to 40,000 tonnes of waste annually into economic opportunity and usable materials, including construction and demolition debris, plastics, and other recyclables.
It is expected to divert 70 to 80 per cent of this waste from landfill and will produce over 7,000 tonnes of recycled materials each year for reuse in infrastructure, agriculture, and manufacturing.
More than 20 green jobs will be created through the project, with a focus on employing women, young people, and people with disabilities.
The centre will also support green entrepreneurship and community participation through initiatives such as cash-for-scrap and local waste collection services.
This milestone project is part of Phase V of the Incentive Fund (2023–2031), a flagship PNG-Australia Partnership initiative that provides competitive grants for small-scale infrastructure valued between PGK3 million and PGK15 million.
The Incentive Fund is governed by a Board of five prominent Papua New Guinean directors, alongside the Secretary of the Department of National Planning and Monitoring and the Minister Counsellor for Economics, Health and Infrastructure of the Australian High Commission.
With a total investment of PGK406 million (AUD150 million), the current phase builds on more than two decades of partnership, during which over 80 projects have been delivered in every province of PNG.
This project represents a major step toward a cleaner, greener future for Papua New Guinea that’s also delivering jobs, innovation, and environmental sustainability in equal measure."
NCD/Central Command takes steps to address police impersonation,18/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4907,"Inspector Ruben Giusu has been appointed as the coordinator for Police Reservist to overseee operations in both the Central and National Capital District command.
The NCD and Central Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi announced this through a press statement.
While welcoming him, Commander Turi also gave directives to all reservists in the command to report to him and identify themselves so the command can know who they are.
He said there are many police impersonators running around in the command who have been involved in illegal activities that have spoiled the good name of the constabulary.
“We have seen impersonators running around claiming to be police reservists who have been involved in illegal activities. With him coming into command, we want to see some changes. We also want to call on the trained reservists to report to him so he can assign them to a police station to work. You were trained and given the police uniform to serve the people. If you are not performing, then we have to take action and remove the uniform from you because the police uniform belongs to the police department,” Turi said.
Mr. Giusu will be based at the Saraga Police Post and will be coordinating the reservists in the command.
The Police Post will now be used as the operational center where all reservists will be in command."
Farmer acknowledges effort,17/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4904,"A farmer and coordinator of youth cooperative societies for agriculture in Northern Province has expressed immense gratitude for the inclusion of farmers and villagers in high-end collaborative consultation workshops.
Livestock Development Corporation had a collective dialogue on Monday, June 16, with the Department of Agriculture and key stakeholders to gauge views and input, as well as challenges with existing data, which will contribute to the National Livestock Policy draft.
Alex Paumbari, a farmer, is representing five youth cooperative societies in the province and shared his appreciation during the final stakeholder consultative workshop in Port Moresby for the Southern region.
Paumbari acknowledged the initiative taken to create the policy framework, which he described as a beacon of light that will bring the livestock industry to greener pastures.
He added that this policy framework would tremendously contribute to providing better development strategies for the livestock industry and Papua New Guineans, especially farmers and villagers who make up 80 percent of PNG’s population, and who are heavily involved in livestock and subsistence farming.
Meanwhile, LDC Managing Director Terry Koim acknowledged all in attendance and shared how important each of them played a role as stakeholders in the development and growth of the livestock industry.
“LDC has been around for more than 40 years, first being created in 1982 with the mandate to generate revenue for the state by commercial beef cattle production through its ranches and abattoir; however, in September 2014, LDC’s remaining ranches and abattoirs were shut down by the then government of the day.
LDC was parked as a program under the then Department of Agriculture and Livestock (DAL), now Department of Agriculture (DoA), from 2014 to 2019”, he said.
LDC in collaboration with the Agriculture Department, will now be preparing for the validation process of this first ever livestock policy framework in July 2025. This draft policy will then be tabled before the NEC for approval and further action."
Prisoners bash alleged rapist,17/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4903,"Angry prisoners at the Bomana Correctional Service have beaten up alleged rapist Danny Karayo for committing another crime while on parole.
Karayo was charged with sexual penetration and was sentenced in 2012 for 14 years, eight months and three weeks before he came out on parole and returned to the police force without authorization of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary. Hence, the constabulary is now investigating this.
Due to the sensitivity of their matter, the prisoners were frustrated and not only beat Karayo but also his co-accused Jerry Aura as well.
Acting Correctional Services Commissioner Bernard Nepo clarified social media rumors stating that the prisoners fought the alleged rapist and not the Correctional Service officers.
“The prisoners were frustrated because he was released on parole and committed another crime, that’s why they beat him and his other co-accused.
“His normal date of release is 2027, but now that he has committed another crime, he will be serving additional years. It certainly depends on the outcome of his case,” Nepo added.
Karayo, and co-accused Aura and Carl Yori were arrested and charged with Deprivation of Liberty, and Rape for allegedly rapping 22-year-old woman at the Saraga police post on June 3 2025.
They appeared before the Waigani District Court on Tuesday, June 10th for arraignment.
During their court hearing, Karayo made several attempts through oral application, requesting the presiding Magistrate, Albert Daniels, to remand him and his co-accused at the Boroko Holding Cell.
However, Magistrate Daniels refuse his application stating that the Boroko Holding Cell keeps perpetrators who are awaiting court for their first appearance, and when their matter is heard in court, they are required to be remanded at the Bomana prison."
Australia proud to support future leaders,17/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4900,"The Australian National University-University of Papua New Guinea (ANU-UPNG) partnership is helping to nurture the next generation of young minds from across PNG.
Issabelle Vilau is among a group of talented students who have benefited from Australian Government support to pursue their dream of achieving academic excellence. For Issabelle Vilau, graduating with a Master of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) was the fulfillment of a lifelong goal.
She says the knowledge and skills she has gained in completing her Masters Degree has enhanced her ability to teach Public Policy Management at UPNG’s School of Business and Public Policy (SBPP).
“These students are going to go back to wherever they are from, whether in Port Moresby, their provinces, or districts, and in whatever capacity they have, they can contribute to development.
“If I can make even just a small change in their mindset or their perspective or just help them in whatever capacity that I can, that would be satisfying,” says Issabelle.
Another beneficiary of the ANU-UPNG partnership is Wilba David Bossin. Wilba received the Dean’s award from SBPP while graduating with a Bachelor of Economics.
Wilba attributes his success to engagement and interaction with fellow students, his lecturers - including ANU Professor Stephen Howes - and staff at the ANU Summer School.
“As a student, the ANU-UPNG Partnership was helpful,” Wilba says.
“We received technical support from people who were far better and more qualified than we, but willing to be patient with us,” Wilba added.
Since its inception in 2012, the UPNG-ANU Partnership has driven rapid growth in economic inquiry and research. Since 2015, enrollments at SBPP have jumped from fewer than 200 students to around 1200.
While the number of courses taught has increased from 5 to 25. Under the partnership, 10 UPNG economic graduates have been awarded scholarships to undertake master's studies at ANU, and all have returned to teaching positions at UPNG."
Guinness clocks in 50 years of service,17/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4895,"While the country anticipates to celebrating the Golden Anniversary of the nation, Commander for Northern Command, Assistant Commissioner of Police Peter Guinness, recently celebrated 50 years of service with the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
He was attested as a policeman on April 11, 1975, at the Bomana Police College.
ACP Peter Guinness joined the RPNGC at the tender age of 16. Guinness, who hails from Biwat in the Angoram District of East Sepik Province, had always looked up to his father, who was a policeman back in the day.
At only seven years of age, Guinness had already set his mind and heart to becoming a police officer one day.
“My father was a Senior Constable at that time, and he was my mentor, and I always wanted to become a policeman just like him,” says Guinness.
Just like most policeman’s kid, Guinness was born and grew up in another province away from home, where his father was serving. He was born in Kaiapit, a station in the Morobe Province and later his father got transferred to Manus Province where he spent his childhood growing up in the little Island province.
It was late 1974, Papua New Guinea was still under the Australian Government, but the whispers about gaining Independence became louder and echoed in every corner of the country. A lot of indigenous people did not fully understand what it was, and what it would bring. Some said there would be no services and no jobs as Australians would leave the country with all that they brought with them.
“I was convinced that when the white men leave PNG and return to their country, most of the jobs created will not be there anymore, and I will waste my time going to school, and when I finish school, I will have nothing to do,” Guinness recalled.
He was in grade nine at that time, and these rumours made him lose hope of continuing his education. Initially, he wanted to join the army and was about to sit for the interview when his mom disagreed with the idea of his joining the army. Later that year, there was a callout for anyone interested to join the Police Force, and without a second thought, young Guinness gave it a shot.
“Even though I always wanted to be a policeman, I still didn’t think I would get accepted into Police Training,” Guinness humbly said.
Guinness, like every other small-town boy, had a bicycle that he would ride around the little laid-back town and come home in the evenings for a bath and dinner or when Mama’s calling for him. One afternoon, it was a little different. he came home on his bike after a ride to the beach, to a very quiet mom, which was unusual for a Sepik mother. Worried about what went wrong, he approached his mom. She looked at him and, with a sad face, told him the good news of his life.
Little did she know that what she presumed to be her sad news would have a golden celebration 50 years later.
“I was very excited that I will be going for Police Training but unfortunately my parents didn’t have enough to pay for my necessities before leaving so I sold my bicycle and bought them and that was the start of my Police Journey,” a curvy smile escaped his face as he recalled this.
50 years on and Guinness, with the same love for his job as he had when he first joined the organisation, was given a front seat at the Lae Yacht Club to be celebrated for his dedication and loyalty in serving the country.
He sat with a humble smile pasted across his face all throughout as his colleagues, families, and friends took turns to speak about his achievements, mentorship, and invaluable contributions to their lives as well as the organisation.
Present at the occasion were the Metropolitan Superintendent for Lae Metro, Provincial Police Commanders for Morobe, Eastern Highlands, Madang and Simbu provinces, Australian Federal Police members, colleagues, friends, and families of Mr Guinness who came with gifts and speeches to celebrate this achievement.
It was an emotional moment for some as they recalled how selfless, dedicated, and supportive he was as a leader, colleague, father, and a good friend. His love for his job extended to the way he portrayed himself around his family, friends, and the communities he lived in.
In comparing his experiences and views of the Constabulary before and after Independence, he said the Police Force before Independence was very disciplined but lost most of its core values after Independence.
“Before Independence, the Police Force was operating very well, the organisation was running perfectly and smoothly and even after independence in 1975 and up but as the years go by the operation of the RPNGC started to deteriorate because the government at that time did not look at Police Force as an organisation that needs support.
” The Police Force is not a moneymaking organisation and the lack of commitment from the government to improve the organization allowed it to disintegrate,” Guinness stressed.
He said the government at that time did not consider the pressing issues of the police force, especially on refurbishing and rebuilding the police barracks and police stations and providing vehicles to ease their jobs. This has resulted in a decline in the performance of the members due to a lack of moral support from the government.
He said the welfare of an officer is important, but with less attention given to this, over time, discipline gradually erodes. He also said command and control is not there, and that is very concerning as a longtime and loyal member of the Force.
“A way to bring back the culture and system of this organisation is to regenerate enthusiasm.
“I am happy that the problem that has been here for so long is currently being looked at by the Commissioner of the day. This is not his problem nor a problem that he created, but it has been here over time, and every step taken to improve the operation of the Constabulary is good,” Guinness said.
He also stressed the breakdown of discipline in the force. He said in the past, there was no such thing as having extended families living in the barracks, which seems to be a practice today. Everything starts from where a person lives and comes out for work each day, and if they are treating the barracks like another settlement, it will show in their attitude towards work as well. One thing he wished to see revived is the level of discipline in the Force.
For Guinness to come this far in his career journey is not only an achievement for himself but for the organisation and his family too. Every successful person always has an untold story of the obstacles and setbacks that came as part of life.
Guinness was no different; he had a roller-coaster life in his private life. His personal life was not as he wanted it to be, but through the storms came fifteen beautiful children and ten grandchildren who became his pillar of strength.
Fifty years of serving the Police Force would mean hundreds of encounters, experiences, and achievements but Guinness said one of which that stood out for him was climbing to the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police.
“Never in my dreams had I thought I’d wear the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police one day, but I am wearing the ACP rank because of sheer hard work that had prompted me to become the person that I am today” Guinness said.
When asked about the so many experiences he had and if there’s one he’d like to share, Guinness smiled and said being a police officer is a job that you will have so many encounters and a lot to tell but he has always held onto the moments when he was faced with life-threatening situations and how he led his men to overcome these situations, but there were also moments where he lost his policemen during their lines of duty.
“I’ve shared pain and tears with families and loved ones of my men, but we had to keep going because we swore an oath to serve and protect lives and properties. His smile faded as he flashed back on those tragic moments.
“At the end of the day, it was through all these experiences that built me over time that I was able to make rational and critical decisions and to come out on top,” he said.
He thanked the Constabulary for all the recognition of his work in having him promoted up the rank and file to where he is now. Apart from his promotions, he was also awarded a Distinguished Police Service Medal, Queen’s Police Medal, and a British Empire Medal.
With all the awards, promotions, and experiences Guinness has, he also holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Public Policy Management, which he obtained at the University of Papua New Guinea, and got his Master’s in Public Administration at the Divine Word University.

Kas raised his concern at the Bogia station during the launch of Manam Resettlement Authority’s new machines for the development of Andarum for the displaced people of Manam Island.
He said the government needs to focus more on getting the people of Manam resettled before another disaster strikes. He said the government project is long overdue, for various reasons, but the people need to be resettled immediately.
Kas stated that Karkar Island is also a volcanic island, currently dormant; however, there have been several minor rumblings since its last eruption in 2013 and the deadliest in 1974, which killed two volcanologists.
“Sapos yu delay long Manam project igo, na what if Karkar Island emi blow tomorrow? Manam has 20,000 people while Karkar has over 100,000 people. How do you deal with that? That is the reason why the Manam Resettlement Bill must be passed, with Karkar in mind and also other districts who might face internal displacements,” said Kas.
Kas is adamant that the government resettle the Manam Islanders in preparation for any other scenarios where Internally Displaced Persons may arise. Not only for Karkar Island, however, he said there is new evidence of people in the lower Bundi area who are currently affected by the activities of the Kurumbukari mine.
Kas, in his term as governor (2012-2017), created the Manam Resettlement Bill to enable the government to create the Manam Resettlement Authority, tasked to resettle displaced Manam Islanders before 2030."
SEZs to improve country’s standing,17/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4891,"The launch of the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Foundation Policy will enable the government to forge opportunities to improve the country's standings, including employment.
Prime Minister James Marape when launching the Policy on Sunday June 15 at the APEC Haus, said this creates a new era of renewed hope for economic growth and prosperity for the next 50 years.
He said the government places a high priority on development around the country as the vehicle to practically promote economic diversification, industrialisation, and rural development.
Minister Marape said SEZs, once fully operational, will support the government’s high-level national development aspirations, as contained in the Medium-Term Development Plan (MTDP)IV and beyond, to raise the economy to K200 million.
Minister for International Trade & Investment, Richard Maru, was thankful and honored to stand by the Prime Minister yesterday to present PNG’s first ever comprehensive Special Economic Zones Foundation Policy 2025-2032 before PNG’s 50th Golden Jubilee Year falls on the 16th September 2025.
“PNG is the last frontier to industrialisation, envied by lucrative investors for the vast natural resources to attract multi-million-kina investments to create wealth, grow the economy, create millions of jobs, and improve the quality of life for all Papua New Guineans,” Minister Maru said.
“We commend the Marape-Roso Gov’t for its vision and leadership in advancing this initiative, especially when the country is facing significant economic challenges.
He said, despite having world-class resource projects in the extractive sector, the economy is struggling with high levels of unemployment, crime, national debt, and a foreign currency rationing crisis.
Minister Maru said he was happy that the PM has come up with a new 20-year development Plan, and SEZ will be the key to this plan going forward.
SEZ is the best Government option as we can be inspired by the rapidly industrialized Southeast Asian countries like China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, which have effectively developed numerous SEZs as their primary economic driver that are transforming their struggling nations into economic prosperity and middle-income countries in this century."

PNGFA welcomes Forest Finance Programme,16/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4880,"PNG Forest Authority officials have recently met with key development partners, including the European Union and senior government officers.
During the discussion, Managing Director John Mosoro expressed that the PNG Forest Authority (PNGFA) is keen to participate in the European Union Climate Change and Biodiversity Programme (EU-CCBP) on Forest Finance.
Mr Mosoro welcomed the Forest Finance programme, describing it as exciting and the first of its kind in PNG.
“Our country has the highest Forest species composition and is rich in biodiversity; therefore, I request and welcome the European Union and all our development partners to carefully assess our Forest landscape and mobilize Forest finance towards the future development of the country,” MD Mosoro said.
Mr Mosoro made his opening remarks last Thursday, June 12 at the “Financing for Forests” workshop sponsored by the European Union’s Climate Change and Biodiversity Programme at the Crown Residence.
“It is a pleasure and honor to welcome you to this important workshop on Forest Finance in PNG. It is an exciting programme and the first of its kind in PNG, “he told key participants comprising partner agencies and key government agencies.
“I must also acknowledge the EU European Union for their ongoing support to our Forest sector, from the development of our national forest inventory to the EU-FCCB programme and work under this current scoping study, “Mr. Mosoro said.
PNGFA commended the EU to support the Government in four thematic programs,
1. Reform and reorganisation of PNGFA Organisation Structure,
2. Mobilisation of Forest finance and Forest Carbon Accounting,
3. Downstream processing and international log export price determination and
4. Upgrade of ICT in PNGFA.
Mr Mosoro emphasised that forests are the heart of the nation and the lungs of world.
“They cover 78 per cent of our land, Harbour exceptional biodiversity and support the livelihoods and identities of millions of our citizens.
“The timber industry has been a foundational part of PNG’s economy since independence and provided a key national income as well as delivering infrastructure to our rural communities.
“As we approach our 50 years of Independence, we must ensure our Forest sector continues to play a key role in the economy and deliver for our people.
“For many years, Forest finance in the country had been defined primarily by timber extraction and export to generate revenue. While this has contributed to national income and rural employment, we also recognised the urgent need to diversify and modernise our approach towards the other Forest ecosystem benefits to promote a green economy within the forestry sector.
The Forest resources are rich with high economic value, but have not been researched to define their true value.
‘As you are aware government has made a policy to ban all round export by the end of this year. The Government has shifted to downstream processing through a sustainable Forest Management system; therefore, it would request a Green Finance investment system.
He said PNGFA was committed to working in close collaboration with its national counterparts, including the Climate Change Authority, the Treasury and others, as well as international and local partners to achieve these goals.
“Our government, through PNGFA, has set important targets to develop Forest plantations and support downstream processing, promote reforestation and afforestation in the country that may be considered for Forest Finance.
“These work in line with our partner agencies, also ensure that our most valuable diversity is conserved in an enhanced protected area network and that our forests form a key part of the global fight on climate change,” Mr Mosoro said."

Government provides K4m freight subsidy for cocoa farmers,14/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4866,"The Government through the Department of National Planning and Monitoring (DNPM) has stepped in to assist farmers in rural areas to transport their produce to markets.
Secretary for the Department of National Planning and Monitoring, Koney Samuel presented a funding support of K4 million to the Cocoa Board of Papua New Guinea (PNG) Chief Executive Officer, Jesse Anjen during a small ceremony in Kokopo on Friday 13 June 2025.
Secretary Samuel said the funding support is an illustration of the National Government’s determination and commitment to strengthen efforts to build and expand the cocoa industry, particularly in remote and rural areas where transport remains a major challenge.
“It has been difficult for our farmers over many years and although we have been running Freight Programs for Coffee and Cocoa farmers, this has been insufficient. With this support now, they can do a lot more in terms of reaching out to our farmers in the rural areas and bringing those produce to the markets,” Mr Samuel said.
The funding is provided under the Capital Investment Program, specifically through the Freight Subsidy Program, managed by the DNPM for commodity boards such as the Cocoa Board and the Coffee Industry Corporation (CIC).
Cocoa Board CEO, Jesse Anjen welcomed the funding, describing it as timely and impactful.
“I thank the Marape-Rosso Government for being a strong advocate of the agriculture sector and recognizing that it is key driver for economic growth. Our goal is to grow the cocoa industry into a K4 billion sector. One of our key initiatives, the Cocoa Freight Program, has already proven its worth. A previous investment of K22 million under the program has generated over K164 million in returns. This is one of the success stories we have had from the Freight Program,” Mr. Anjen said.
He explained that the Freight Program not only reduces transport cost for farmers but also supports infrastructure development.
“We are establishing storage facilities at key points along the value chain to help consolidate produce for shipping or air transport. This additional K4 million will allow us to continue expanding these services in remote areas,” Mr. Anjen said.
Secretary Samuel’s visit to the East New Britain Province is part of the 2025 Inter-departmental Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Exercise which has been carried out around the country for 3 weeks.

Morobe polling officials petition EC,14/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4862,"Polling officials in Morobe have given the Electoral Commission 10 days to reinstate all polling teams or they will stand down from conducting local level government (LLG) elections in the province.
Returning officer for the Kabwum by-election, supported by the province’s assistant returning officers, presented their petition this morning (Friday, June 13th) to the Morobe Provincial Election Advisory Committee (PEAC).
A decision was made last week by the PNG Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai, to have only two polling teams per local level government, to conduct the LLG elections.
Morobe, the province with the largest land mass in the country, has 39 LLGs in its 10 districts, and 424 polling teams to ensure LLG elections are conducted within the given timeframe. The initial number of polling officials for Morobe was set at 2,968.
Kabwum by-election Returning Officer, James Neapukali, presented their concerns to the Morobe Provincial Election Advisory Committee at the disaster office in Lae.
Neapukali, who was the former Finschhafen district administrator, outlined that reducing the number of polling teams to only two per LLG may compromise the ability to cover all polling stations adequately. This can potentially lead to delays, incomplete polling, or other irregularities that could undermine the integrity of the election.
“Before going into actual polling that is four weeks away – 12 July we should start – and having experience in past elections; this period is for us to prepare for polling,” Neapukali stated. “But actually, we have not done that yet, showing that bad things are going to happen, maybe due to the issue of funding not being made available on time.”
Neapukali used the LLG of Wain-Erap, Nawaeb district, as an example, saying while it has 18 wards, only two polling teams are expected to cover the area, which is one of the most hard-to-reach districts in Morobe; similar to the other eight rural districts – excluding Lae.
“Then the Electoral Commission directed us and suspended all the polling locations and only left two, there will definitely be a problem,” Neapukali continued.
“That’s why, we AROs and myself, as RO, we do this petition and we are not accepting this call. We petition EC to reinstate all the gazetted polling areas. If you do not comply to our petition, then we AROs and myself – RO – we will stand down from work. We will not risk our lives.”
Wampar ARO, Kamis Connery, voiced their support, highlighting that they are the ones who will be on ground to run the election, and they do not want a repetition of the destruction that was caused during the 2022 national general elections.
Their petition was received by the provincial election manager, Simon Soheke, in the presence of the committee’s deputy chairman and Lae City Authority chief executive officer, Robin Calistus, and provincial disaster coordinator, Charlie Masange.
The petitions were copied to the PEAC chairman, Kissu Lucas, provincial administrator, Max Bruten, provincial human resource manager, Kusak Meluk, operations manager Momase PNG Electoral Commission, Bura Maro, PNGEC director operations, Margret Vagi and the Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai."
Polio vaccines arrive,14/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4861,"Life-saving polio vaccines arrive in PNG to protect the nation’s future Emergency immunisation campaign to reach 3 million children under 10 as national polio response ramps up
The fight against polio in PNG is moving ahead with the arrival of more than 4.6 million life-saving vaccine doses to kickstart a nationwide immunisation campaign.
The shipment of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) touched down in the capital Port Moresby in the early hours of Friday, 13 June 2025.
The first round of emergency vaccinations will now be launched to stop the spread of poliovirus.
With a second shipment scheduled for July, health authorities aim to vaccinate every child under 10 years of age — nearly 3 million children in total.
The intensive two-round campaign is supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and the Australian Government.
The vaccine delivery comes just weeks after PNG declared a national health emergency. Circulating poliovirus was detected in environmental samples and healthy children.
“This is an urgent race to protect our children and stop the virus in its tracks,” said Dr Veera Mendonca, UNICEF Papua New Guinea Representative. “The arrival of these vaccines is a vital first step. Now we need to get them to every child.”
Recognising the seriousness of the situation, Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea H.E. Ewen McDonald said his country was pleased to provide an immediate contribution of AUD 5 million to support PNG’s response.
“Our funding will help deliver an integrated vaccination campaign, combining polio vaccines with other routine childhood immunisations — to give children across PNG the best possible start in life. The arrival in Port Moresby today (yesterday) of a large shipment of polio vaccines is an important milestone.”
Mr McDonald said Australia would continue to work with PNG to protect children, reduce the risk of future outbreaks, and support a healthier, more resilient region.
The vaccines will be distributed across the country in the coming weeks. Health workers will be deployed by air, foot, boat, helicopter and vehicle to reach children in even the most remote villages.
PNG had been polio-free for 25 years until a previous outbreak in 2018. The current outbreak was detected in April and May through environmental surveillance in Morobe Province and Port Moresby.
No cases of paralysis have been reported. The detection of the virus in environmental samples and healthy children shows why vaccination is urgently needed to protect all children.
“Routine immunisation coverage is still too low in many areas, putting children at real risk,” said Dr Mendonca. “This outbreak is a wake-up call. We must act now — by strengthening routine immunisation and tackling the polio outbreak — to protect our children and prevent this from happening again.”
UNICEF, WHO and the Australian Government are working with the National Department of Health. The partners are supporting the campaign with vaccines, cold chain equipment, transport, training, operational costs, communication and community engagement.
“We need all hands on deck to stop this outbreak as quickly as possible,” said Dr Sevil Huseynova, WHO Representative in Papua New Guinea. “Polio is a preventable disease, and vaccines are our most powerful tool. The arrival of this first shipment of vaccines is an important milestone. We urge all parents and caregivers to bring their children for vaccination — this is the best way to keep them safe.”
Health Minister Elias Kapavore said the government was fully committed to protecting every child in Papua New Guinea from polio.
“This vaccination campaign is a vital part of our national emergency response. We are calling on all health workers, provincial health authorities, community leaders and families to join forces and ensure that no child is left behind. Together, we can stop this outbreak and safeguard the health of our nation’s children.”
The arrival of the vaccines marks the next phase in PNG’s emergency response to the outbreak."
Nature Park Celebrates 13 Years,14/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4860,"The Port Moresby Nature Park has proudly marked its 13th anniversary, celebrating over a decade of conservation, education, and community engagement in Papua New Guinea.
A commemorative event was held on Thursday, June 12th, bringing together staff, sponsors, and supporters to reflect on the park’s remarkable journey and achievements since opening its gates in 2012.
The day began with the launch of the “Naturelympics” — a light-hearted internal challenge where staff members from different departments competed in games and team-building activities, reinforcing the spirit of unity and collaboration that defines the park's operations.
Chief Executive Officer Johnpaul Houston delivered a heartfelt message of gratitude, acknowledging the ongoing support from donors, board members, and the public.
“Today is not just a birthday. It’s a celebration of the hard work, resilience, and passion of everyone who believes in our mission,” Mr. Houston said.
The celebration concluded with a special cake-cutting ceremony and brunch, donated by one of the park’s long-time supporters.
As the Port Moresby Nature Park looks ahead, its commitment to protecting biodiversity, inspiring environmental awareness, and serving as a safe haven for learning and leisure remains unwavering.
With the continued support of its members, partners, and the wider community, the park is optimistic about expanding its impact in the years to come.
Thirteen years down — and many more to grow."
Monitoring compliance a challenge,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4856,"The Internal Revenue Commission and the Independent Consumer & Competition Commissioner gave an update on the challenges faced during the two weeks of implementing the GST Zero rated measure that was applied to 13 essential store goods.
IRC Commissioner General Sam Koim said this is the first time there was ever a tax relief, therefore IRC is learning a lot in this process.
“In terms of shop owners, while appearing to be removing the GST also, they then inflate the actual price ahead. And these are kind of challenges, especially in the monitoring of the compliance,” he said. “Those are the challenges that we'll be facing.”
“There’s a lot of revenue at stake as well. If we do not administer this properly, then a lot of shop owners might not pass relief to the ultimate consumer. So might appear to be and also stocking up GST zero rated stock for future or something like that.”
From the tax perspective, the retail sector has been challenging to administer and manage resulting in the IRC’s inability to correctly audit, assess and penalize non-compliant taxpayers. The consequence has been the reduction and loss in the overall tax revenue, a drop-in tax compliance, a non-disclosure of revenue specifically and directly in affecting GST with added costs passed on to the ultimate consumers.
“There's a lot of challenges we anticipate, but we also preparing at the same time. It's just that we don't have the digital tools that we anticipated to have it to enable us to do this. But be it as it may, we are actually preparing to do the manual enforcements, and that's why we are forging this relationship with ICCC and customs, especially the goods that are hitting our shores at the ports will also be zero rated from that point onwards. That's ideally, we'd like to do, it's passed on until it is ultimately benefiting the consumer,” Koim said.
Commissioner ICCC, Paulus Ain gave an update on how many business houses have already been caught and are in court for not complying with the government’s policy on the GST zero-rated goods.
Ain said, “Business houses need to cooperate with us it is a policy and all of us must work together in the interest of this country.”
“After being out and about we have been given a run around by businesses houses, about 159 are currently in court.
“We are aware of who you are, business communities work with us and the 13 items must be zero-rated.
“To consumers, do not expect IRC and ICCC to do the hard yards, you are at the shops every day. If you see some diversions and you are suspicious go to our offices in the provinces,” Ain said.
Koim stated retailers found in breach of the changes in law will be severely dealt with through the imposition of the following measures 1. Administrative penalties for non-compliance; 2.
Recovery of amounts wrongly collected 3. Suspension and cancelation of GST registration and 4. Prosecution under section 95 (1) (f) (i) (ii) (iii) (40) (4) (a) (b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 2003."
MV Scorpio Marks a New Era for Sumkar,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4855,"Member for Sumkar and Vice Minister for Petroleum, Alexander Suguman Orme, this week welcomed the arrival of MV Scorpio, a newly acquired landing vessel purchased by the Sumkar District Development Authority (DDA) to enhance sea transport and service delivery across the district.
MV Scorpio successfully completed its maiden voyage, sailing from Port Moresby to Alotau, and arriving in Madang on the 08th of this month. Under the leadership of Captain Tom Maob and a two-man crew, the vessel departed Port Moresby on Saturday, 31st May.
The vessel was purchased at a cost of K1.3 million from Lamana Development Corporation, demonstrating Sumkar DDA’s commitment in investing in essential infrastructure for the benefit of its communities and to progressively build the districts internal revenue.
“The MV Scorpio is more than just a vessel — it represents our vision for improved connectivity, reliable service delivery, and economic empowerment for our people,” said Alexander Suguman Orme during the welcoming ceremony. “I commend the DDA, Lamana Development Corporation, and all involved for making this project a reality.”
MV Scorpio is capable of carrying both cargo and passengers and will be vital in transporting medical supplies, school materials, building resources, and economic goods to remote coastal and island communities within the Sumkar District and even outside depending on the partners and stakeholders who are interested to hire the vessel. Its acquisition is a major boost to the DDA’s efforts in strengthening local infrastructure, particularly in remote and underserved areas that depend heavily on maritime transport.
With over 150, 000 population on Karkar and Bagabag Islands, people rely heavily on marine transportation to conduct businesses, purchase goods and access services. The small outboard motors have a limited capacity in transporting commuters and in most instances during rough and windy weather, cargo end up at the bottom of the ocean when the small crafts capsized. With the inclusion of this vessel, it will enable better passage for the islanders.
Mr. Orme emphasized the importance of such strategic investments in enabling government services to reach every corner of the district and ensure that no community is left behind."
Pilot Jailed for Drug Smuggling,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4854,"Deputy Commissioner of Police – Special Operations, Donald Yamasombi, has expressed satisfaction over the outcome of an Australian Supreme Court ruling that saw a convicted drug smuggler sentenced to 11 years in prison.
The ruling, handed down on Wednesday, June 11, 2025, concluded the high-profile case involving 54-year-old Benard Hamilton Alexander, who was arrested for smuggling 56 kilograms of methamphetamine from Papua New Guinea into Australia on March 21, 2023.
Alexander had initially pleaded not guilty and maintained that stance throughout multiple court appearances. However, in a surprising turn of events, he changed his plea to guilty shortly before Yamasombi and another investigator were scheduled to testify via video link.
“With that conviction and sentencing, I want to thank all the officers involved in the investigation,” said Yamasombi. “That includes those who provided intelligence information that led to the arrests, and our counterparts from the Australian Federal Police who worked alongside us.”
He added that while he was prepared to give evidence in court, the sudden plea change meant his testimony was no longer needed. “I was ready and waiting for the moment to take the stand, but I’m happy that justice was served regardless,” he said.
The investigation began with a joint operation in Bulolo, Morobe Province, where authorities apprehended two Asian nationals and six Papua New Guineans in relation to the drug smuggling attempt. All eight were subsequently charged and appeared before the courts in PNG.
Yamasombi highlighted the importance of international collaboration in cross-border crime and praised officers from Lae, Port Moresby, and other regions for their efforts.
The case marks a significant milestone in ongoing efforts to combat transnational drug trafficking between PNG and Australia."
Marape Honors PANGU Legacy,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4853,"Prime Minister James Marape has commemorated the 58th anniversary of PANGU Pati by honouring the party’s founding leaders and their role in shaping Papua New Guinea’s independence and national identity.
Speaking ahead of the anniversary on June 13, Prime Minister Marape described PANGU Pati as “the political force that paved the way for Papua New Guinea’s independence.”
“PANGU Pati was born before the country itself,” said Marape. “It was the leadership and courage of PANGU’s founding members that pushed fearlessly for our freedom.”
Founded on 13 June 1967 while PNG was still under colonial rule, PANGU Pati emerged at a time of widespread division—cultural, regional, and political. It united young leaders from across the territory under one vision: self-rule and national unity.
“They were young men—many in their 20s and 30s—who stood against discrimination and demanded our people chart their own future,” the Prime Minister said.
PANGU played a critical role in unifying the country, particularly during a time when regional movements like the Mataungan Association and Napidakoe Navitu challenged the idea of national unity. The party’s momentum led to key victories in the 1968 elections and later, full independence in 1975.
Marape paid tribute to the 13 founding parliamentarians, including Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, Sir Paul Lapun, Sir Albert Maori Kiki, and others, calling them “nation-builders” whose legacies live on through the country’s democratic foundations.
Under PANGU’s leadership, institutions like the Ombudsman Commission, the Defence Force, Police, and Correctional Services were established, along with the Constitution and the localisation of civil service roles.
As PNG’s third PANGU Prime Minister after Somare and Sir Rabbie Namaliu, Marape reflected on his 2019 return to the party, emphasising his commitment to its people-first values and vision for economic independence.
He urged the younger generation to honour the past while building a stronger, united future:
“The opportunity is now ours—to learn from our past 50 years, correct what we must, and shape a future of strength and unity.”"

“Under this plan, we aim to reduce road fatalities and traffic-related injuries by a measurable margin, achieve over 90 percent compliance in vehicle registration and driver's license, and establish regional enforcement and customer service centers across the country,” Mr Avira said.
Minister Kaeok says the government expects the RTA to contribute meaningfully to government regulation, ensuring that compliance remains reasonable for citizens and businesses.
“Most importantly, we expect RTA to build and maintain public trust through transparent, efficient service delivery.

Islanders soon to call Andarum home,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4850,"The people of Manam Island based at the Asuramba Care Centre were overjoyed at the prospect of being resettled in Andarum in the next three or four months, following the arrival of two new machinery that will begin the clearing process of the resettlement site in Andarum.
Charles Tola, Iabu LLG counselor in Ward 3 of Bogia District, Madang province is one Manam Islander excited to see the movement of the machines.
The Manam Islanders were evacuated following 2004 volcanic eruptions and were settled in care centres in Bogia. Their population at that time was around 9, 000. After more than 20 years of living in the care centres, numbers have more than doubled to be at least 21,000.
Over the years, life in the care centres was not always pleasant for the displaced islanders. While learning to adapt to the new environment, they conflicted among themselves and with landowners for gardening space, education opportunities, health services, and even keeping their traditions alive.
Today, they look forward to see a government’s commitment come to fruition; to settle them in Andarum, where they will now call home on the mainland."

Call to strengthen security in schools,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4847,"The Minister for Education, Lucas Dekena, strongly condemns the criminal actions at Nawaeb Secondary School in Morobe and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to making all schools safe and secure for students.
“We will not allow criminals to bring fear into our schools. Every student has the right to feel safe and protected while they learn.
“The Department is already working with the Morobe Provincial Education Division, police, and local leaders to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice and that measures are in place to prevent a repeat of this horrific incident,” Minister Dekena said.
He added, “The incident at Nawaeb Secondary School was a grave violation of student safety and security. However, through the swift efforts of school leaders, provincial authorities, and law enforcement, the situation has been brought under control.”

In response to the incident, the Department, through the Morobe Provincial Education Division, will immediately review school security measures in the province.
This review will also apply to all schools nationwide. The measures include: Tighter gate access control, more police patrols during vulnerable periods and hours, stronger community partnerships to improve school safety, and psychological support for affected students.
On the evening of Thursday, 5 January 2025, seventeen armed individuals, believed to be part of a criminal group, entered the Nawaeb Lutheran Secondary School grounds and attempted to steal mobile phones from the girls’ dormitory.

Mobile police barracks to be constructed,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4845,"Madang Province will soon have its own mobile police barracks.
This follows the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea (ELCPNG) and the Madang Provincial Government.
ELCPNG secretary, Bernard Kaisom, and acting Madang provincial administrator, Daniel Aloi, signed the MoU on May 26th at the Madang Provincial Government office, witnessed by officers from ELCPNG, the Madang Provincial Police Command, the Madang Provincial Government and Administration.
The MoU is to allow the Madang Provincial Government to develop Asuar land portion 848 for the construction of the Madang mobile police barracks, which is worth K15 million.
Madang acting provincial police commander, Superintendent Robert Baim, was relieved that the signing took place and stated that this now paves the way for work to begin on the 40-man police barracks project.
Baim said this project is funded by the Department of National Planning and Monitoring, and should have commenced last year, but due to administrative issues and political tussles, it was delayed to this year.
He outlined that the project will improve police manpower to address law and order issues in the province, adding that many times he has had to request mobile police units from other provinces to assist local police in their duties.
“I want to thank ELCPNG for seeing our need and making land available to support police projects in Madang,” he stated.
“When this barracks is completed, it will complement our community policing unit program, and we can attend to law and order issues accordingly.”
Baim said the national government has made a payment of K5 million to start this project, so an additional K10 million will be paid later to ensure the project is completed.
He thanked Madang Governor, Ramsey Pariwa, and the provincial executive council for their commitment to supporting police in the province with projects of staff accommodation, logistics on land and sea, and others.
ELCPNG secretary, Bernard Kaisom, said this MoU was signed with the Madang Provincial Government, and the church is ready and committed to partnering with them in their development initiatives.
Kaisom said in the past, the church operated the Asuar Leprosy Hospital and later, the Yangpela Didiman program, on the Asuar portion.
“This signing demonstrates the Madang Provincial Government’s confidence in partnering with ELCPNG in its development aspirations, and we are grateful that a lot of church assets are in Madang,” continued secretary Kaisom.
“This agreement is more than just an agreement, and we are looking forward to working closely with you in our ongoing discussions for other projects.”
Madang provincial acting administrator, Daniel Aloi, said they appreciate this signing, adding that under the leadership of Madang Governor Ramsey Pariwa, law and order is a priority, and they are supporting where needed.
Aloi urged continued dialogue between the Madang Provincial Government and ELCPNG with the ELC Madang District and Amele Circuit to make this project a success."
PNG-based dual Australian and Nigerian citizen charged with human trafficking of PNG nationals,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4841,"A woman who allegedly lured Papua New Guinea (PNG) nationals to Australia with fake scholarships before exploiting them has been charged with debt bondage and other human trafficking offences.
The AFP charged the woman – a dual Australian and Nigerian citizen who was based primarily in PNG – after she arrived at Brisbane Airport on a flight from PNG yesterday (11 June, 2025).
She appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court yesterday afternoon charged with 31 offences and was granted conditional bail to reappear before the same court on 19 September, 2025.
An investigation began in July, 2022, when the AFP’s Northern Command Human Trafficking Team received information from Queensland Police about a group of PNG nationals who had moved to Australia to study but were instead allegedly forced to work against their will on farms.
The woman allegedly lured them to Australia on the promise of full educational scholarships.
The AFP alleges that between March 2021 and July 2023, the woman bought 15 PNG nationals to Australia. Shortly before, or after, their arrival in Australia, the students were allegedly forced to sign legal documents and agree to repay hitherto unmentioned costs associated with tuition, airfares, visa applications, insurance and legal fees.
These unexpected costs placed the PNG nationals in excessive debt.
The woman then allegedly forced the PNG nationals to work on farms at different locations in Queensland – at times in contravention to their visas – and received wages on their behalf from the farm owners.
The woman then withheld the wages from the workers as repayments for their debts.
The woman, 56, was charged with:
•	Four counts of trafficking in persons, contrary to section 271.2(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is 12 years’ imprisonment;
•	14 counts of deceptive recruiting for labour or services, contrary to section 270.7 of the Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is seven years’ imprisonment; and
•	13 counts of engaging in conduct that caused a person to enter into debt bondage, contrary to section 270.7C of the Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is four years’ imprisonment.
AFP Detective Superintendent Adrian Telfer said the AFP remained committed to the protection of vulnerable foreign workers targeted by those driven by greed and profits.
“Victims of debt bondage and other human trafficking offences can be lured to Australia with a promise of a dream career or free education, things they may not have access to in their country of origin,"" Det-Supt Telfer said.
“If the conditions of that promise change, it can leave victims in an extremely vulnerable situation in a foreign country, where they are likely to have little financial or emotional support, and face issues with language barriers.
“The AFP can help people who are exploited and is focused on ensuring the welfare of victims.”"

She highlighted the importance of both theoretical learning such as budgeting and saving and the practical ability to train and support others in financial matters
Mr Guninandhi Das, CEO of Women’s Microbank emphasized the role of mindset in fostering sound financial habits.
“Financial literacy starts with the mindset of savings.”
“It is not just about putting money away - it’s about making everyday decisions that prioritize value over waste.”
He encouraged graduates to form habits that promote savings and to eventually embed it as part of their culture. Mr Das further advised trainees to maintain active bank accounts and mobile numbers, underscoring their importance in accessing future financial services and building credibility.
Delivering the official closing remarks on behalf of Secretary DFCDR Jerry Ubase, Director of Programme, George Kulisi, acknowledged the cultural norm in Papua New Guinea of giving over saving and called for a shift in mindset that supports financial responsibility.
He commended the training’s alignment with the Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS), specifically Priority Area 11, which promotes community empowerment, financial inclusion, and youth leadership.
“The Department remains committed to building meaningful partnerships with institutions like UPNG,” Mr Kulisi stated.
“We encourage graduates to apply this knowledge and lead the way in building a more financially responsible Papua New Guinea.”
Participants also took the stage to share their reflections. Vencislos Edmund, speaking on behalf of the male trainees, thanked all stakeholders and expressed his determination to pass on what he had learnt.

Imi Ward Development Plan Launch,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4837,"In a landmark event, the Imi Ward in Enga province successfully launched its Ward Development Plan that integrates disaster risk reduction to local plans in alignment with the Nation’s Vision 2050 Plan, SDG Goals, Sendai Framework for disaster management and enhanced peace for growth to empower community leadership for change and natural assets stock take and plan sustainable use.
The development and launch of the plan marked the culmination of a community owned and driven initiative supported by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) through funding from the U.S. Government.  Development of the plan received technical inputs from IOM and local authorities.
The launch was led solely by community leaders, and the ward councillor in Imi Ward after several consultations with assistance from Enga Provincial Disaster Coordinator, the support of all parts of the community. Representing IOM at the launch were Sakurako Oki, Public Health Specialist, and Benjamin Sipa, Senior Project Assistant. The event drew the attendance of key officials from the Enga Provincial and Wabag District Administrations, including directors from the Community Development Division and Local Level Government, the district administrator, agriculture and education officers, and law and order coordinators.
The gathering provided a platform for local leaders, officials, and community members to share remarks and commend the collaborative efforts behind the development of the plan.
Importantly, members of the Provincial Management Team (PMT) who attended the event pledged PGK 100,000 to support the construction of a double classroom — a priority identified in the ward plan. This contribution demonstrates growing provincial commitment to locally informed development planning.
The Director for Local Level Government commended the community members in undertaking this work, and IOM for providing technical inputs.  He noted that such plans represent a critical new pathway for complementing the government’s development initiatives in Papua New Guinea.
The Wabag District Administrator echoed these sentiments, urging other wards to follow Imi’s example and reinforcing that ward development committees should be central to community governance.
More than 800 people, including women, children, youth, and elders, gathered for the launch. Community contributions in both cash and kind, traditional performances, and the involvement of children highlighted the spirit of ownership and pride among the people of Imi. Youth groups organized clean-up efforts, children cerebrated by singing, and volunteers helped decorate the school grounds, which served as the venue for the event.
While the plan’s launch marks significant progress, IOM also updated the community on the status of a proposed multi-purpose community evacuation center.
The successful launch event highlights the power of inclusive planning, strong community leadership, and collaboration between development partners and government institutions. To ensure the Ward Development Plan remains a dynamic tool for guiding Imi Ward’s long-term, sustainable development, continued capacity-building and the formal establishment of an active Ward Development Committee are essential."
Hope emerges for displaced Manam Islanders,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4835,"The Manam Resettlement Authority (MaRA) has made some progress in the resettlement exercise when they finally brought in two newly purchased machines on Tuesday to start work on the resettlement program.
The new excavator and bulldozer were bought in from Lae, Morobe province and costed approximately K1.2 million.
It was a joyous day for the displaced people of Manam Island currently located in care centres at Potzdam, Asuramba and Mangem to witness the launch of the two machines brought in by MaRA. After more than 20 years, they finally see a glimmer of hope as this signifies a working progress to their resettlement in Andarum.
MaRA Chief Executive Officer Richard Baia elaborated that with the inclusion of these two machines, their work should speed up with partners in construction, Works and Gabusi construction, to commence the next phase which is acquisition of land and settlement.
It was an emotional event for former Extension Services Manager of MaRA, Paul Akuram, who recalled the challenges faced when conducting assessments for over 13 years before retiring. He was pleased to see progress made after he left. Mr. Akuram played a huge role in mediating to awareness campaigns during his time from 2009. He now urges the government to fully show support to the resettlement program and alleviate many challenges being faced by the Manam islanders within the care centres.
While no provincial or district government official was present to witness this small but significant event, former Madang Governor Jim Kas was invited to witness the event as this program was his brainchild. Kas was not impressed by the lack of his predecessors to date and urged the provincial and district government to take ownership, even though it is a national government issue. He further thanked the host communities of Bogia who have catered for the internally displaced people of Manam, even with no proper arrangements when hurled with the resettlement circumstances.
Manam representative Kaugare Ferdinand is hopeful that 2025 will be a fruitful year and anticipates resettlement to begin soon.
Host community representative Raphael Juaf was also thanful to see a new development into the resettlement program.
In addition, Works Manager Sakarim Michael indicated continued support in ensuring that work can now progress swiftly for resettlement following the arrival of the machinery.
Mr. Baia also acknowledged his staff who have tirelessly worked to see this program come to fruition and a special mention was also made to a late staff, Gabriel Saul, who passed away two weeks ago after the purchase of the two machines. He also informed the people that a Board is in place and will oversee the program as it transitions into the next phase.
Board members will include Dr. Figa Boga as Chairman, the Provincial Administrator, the Archbishop of Madang Archdiocese and a member from DPM.
It was also made clear that after the program is completed, all machineries purchased by MaRA will be given to the Bogia District Administration.
The machines were blessed by Bogia Catholic Parish priest and will eventually be driven up to relocation site this week."
Simbu projects assessed in Nationwide Evaluation Exercise,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4834,"A monitoring and evaluation (M&E) exercise is underway in Simbu Province, spearheaded by the Department of National Planning and Monitoring (DNPM) to assess the implementation and progress of development projects funded between 2022 and 2024.
The exercise aims to verify the status of projects financed through various sources, including the Public Investment Program (PIP), District and Provincial Services Improvement Programs (DSIP and PSIP), development partners, tax credit schemes, and private sector contributions.
According to the First Assistant Secretary for the Social Sector Division, Rose Raka, the findings will contribute to a national report being prepared for Prime Minister James Marape, highlighting tangible outcomes and the effectiveness of government investment in districts and provinces across the country.
“Prime Minister James Marape intends to report on the achievements and developments that have taken place throughout the districts and provinces across the country. Given that a significant amount of funding has been directed to the provinces and districts, it is important that a report is compiled and submitted so the Prime Minister has tangible outcomes to present—showing what has actually been financed through the allocated funds over the past three years.”
Simbu Provincial Administrator John Punde welcomed the initiative and stressed the importance of building institutional knowledge, strengthening manpower, and restructuring administrative systems to align with evolving national priorities such as climate change and improved service delivery.
“Moving forward, you need the right manpower to deliver on those expectations. I think the team has done a wonderful job, and the level of institutional knowledge we are building through this interaction is valuable. It will help us in the future—especially when individuals move into senior positions—because these issues take time to develop. Gaining hands-on experience, engaging in discussions, and reflecting on these matters collectively can expose you to 30 to 40 years of accumulated experience in a short period.”
The team is expected to complete inspections across all six districts in Simbu. The exercise is part of a nationwide effort to promote transparency and accountability in public spending."

Mr Tinga said to save cost, the Provincial Police Commanders (PPCs) were instructed to identify police-owned houses, or alternatively, seek assistance from the provincial governments to fund rental accommodation for these new pass-outs.
Mr Tinga said the recruits have also signed a pledge of loyalty, requiring them to uphold the values of ethics and discipline throughout their CAP period and onwards."
SEZ license approved for Sea Park Development at Ela Beach,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4832,"The Government’s Special Economic Zone Authority (SEZA) has approved a Special Economic Zone License for a landmark tourism investment for the Sea Park Development Project at Ela Beach with an investment value of PGK 2.2 billion.
This will see a complete transformation of Port Moresby City and the Ela Beach precinct led by international investors. It is part of the National Government’s development initiative and is being driven by Richard Maru, the Minister responsible for SEZ and the Ministry for International Trade & Investment (MITI).
The Sea Park Development, anchored within a nationally endorsed SEZ framework, is positioned to become a landmark project. The project will serve not only as a beacon for international and domestic tourism but also as a sustainable model for future urban developments in Papua New Guinea. It will also be a beacon of attraction to investors and make PNG an attractive investment destination. This landmark investment will compliment Paga Hill Special Economic Zone and will change the look of the capital city and attract foreign tourists and cruise ships to anchor in Port Moresby.
Designated and licensed as a Tourism Special Economic Zone, the Ela Beach precinct is now home to a mixed-use development that includes luxury residences, commercial and retail centers, a five-star international hotel, and a nature-integrated hilltop retreat. This transformative project is expected to create over 2,000 jobs during construction and about 700 full time jobs for PNG nationals after the completion of the project. It will also generate substantial long-term economic benefits through local business participation, tourism development, and government tax revenues in the 10-years tax break and after.
The Sea Park Development Project is aligned with Papua New Guinea's Vision 2050, particularly its goals of sustainable development, infrastructure expansion, and tourism-led economic diversification. Its broad benefits include:
•	Increased foreign tourism inflows and international brand recognition.
•	Urban regeneration and improved public infrastructure at Ela Beach.
•	Enhanced investment attractiveness through SEZ-led policy incentives.
•	Long-term uplift in local living standards and private sector development.
The Chairman of Special Economic Zones Authority, Dr. Lawrence Sause, praised the project as ""a shining example of how the SEZ framework is unlocking Papua New Guinea's investment potential and accelerating economic diversification.""
It also shows that despite the challenges that PNG faces, there are rooms to lure FDIS into the country for its growth and development.
The SEZA and the SEZ policy for which SEZA rides on, provides streamlined approvals, fiscal incentives, and investor protections, which have proven instrumental in attracting strategic partners and foreign capital. The Sea Park Project is seen as a blueprint for future SEZ developments that will catalyze growth across the country.
SEZA states that they fully welcome the Sea Park investors and will continue to deliver a regulatory environment that builds investor confidence, lures FDIS and maintain a level playing field for both foreign and citizens participation in business development in PNG.
Meanwhile, SEZA has terminated the SEZ License for Mayur Industrial's Central Cement and Lime Project (CCLP) pending certain specific issues to be sorted out.
Once the company irons out all these outstanding issues then it can re-apply for a new SEZ License. SEZA states that this decision reflects SEZA's commitment to ensuring that all license holders operate within a clearly regulated framework that supports genuine downstream industrial development."
Police Work Boosted in Kairuku District,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4831,"With a renewed focus on law and order in the district, Member for Kairuku and Energy Minister, Peter Isoaimos officially handed over new IT equipment and confirmed logistics support to the Bereina Police Station to boost policing efforts across the electorate.
The donated equipment, valued at over K16,000, includes two laptops, a desktop computer, a large and two small printers, a UPS, and a generator. These are intended to enhance data processing, case management, and communication for officers in Bereina, enabling faster and more efficient processing of suspects
“In recent months, we’ve seen a surge in criminal activity in Kairuku. This is part of our response — not just through words, but through action,” said Isoaimo. “We’re equipping the police with the tools and logistics they need to work effectively.”
As part of the Kairuku District Development Authority's initiative, two open-back Land Cruiser vehicles have been made available for police use. In collaboration with the Police Headquarters, an additional two hire vehicles have been secured to support operations in Bereina and Doa.
The Bereina Police Station building is undergoing full renovations, with additional work planned for the expansion of the cell block, which currently cannot hold the increasing number of detainees. Renovations are also planned for the Doa Police Post, originally built by Ramu Company, and improvements to police housing are on the agenda.
Police Station Commander Sergeant William Hoiba was commended by the MP for his leadership, having served in the Central Province Police for over 20 years. Isoaimo emphasised Hoiba’s commitment to zero tolerance of corrupt practices within the force.
“We need to take a tough, no-nonsense approach. When suspects are caught, they must be processed in Bereina and sent directly to Bomana for rehabilitation,” Isoaimo said. “We cannot allow them to be released from Boroko under what many call ‘snake bail’ — that undermines policing.”
Isoaimo also called on all police personnel to uphold integrity and discipline in their service, warning that compromise will not be tolerated.
Inspector Kingsley Lua, Staff Officer to the Provincial Police Commander for Central, acknowledged the importance of continued government support and community cooperation in restoring law and order.
The MP further raised concerns about NCD police who have allegedly been harassing SME-owned PMV trucks crossing the Laloki Bridge into the city in the early hours. He pledged to personally investigate these incidents alongside Central police and the media in the coming days.
“These trucks were bought through the Kairuku SME program by ordinary villagers. They deserve to operate in peace without fear or extortion,” Isoaimo stated.
With over 50 reservists already engaged and plans to deploy more officers across Kairuku’s 51 wards, covering Mekeo, Kairuku Coast, and Kuni LLGs, the district’s law enforcement presence is expected to grow significantly.
“As we prepare to celebrate PNG’s 50th Independence Anniversary, our people deserve to live in peace, not fear. We may not eliminate lawlessness entirely, but we are determined to reduce it dramatically,” Isoaimo said."
History comes home on the wings of a Hell’N Pelican,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4830,"A Douglas A-20 Havoc bomber aircraft used by the 5th United States Army Air Force (USAAF) during the Second World War has taken residence at the Papua New Guinea National Museum and Art Gallery (NMAG) in Port Moresby.
Nicknamed Hell’N Pelican II, the aircraft was returned to Papua New Guinea by the Royal Australian Air Force on board the Australian Defence Vessel (ADV) Reliant.
The delivery of the aircraft recognises Australia and Papua New Guinea’s shared history, with the aircraft being a permanent representation of the long-standing cooperation and close defence relationship forged in shared suffering, tenacity and sacrifice during the Second World War.
“The friendship between PNG and Australia means a lot not only to the people of PNG but also to the PNG National Museum and Art Gallery,” said Terence Moka, President of the PNG National Museum and Art Gallery Board of Trustees.
“We accept with thanks the gift of the new heritage aviation shelter, and the return of the historical Havoc aircraft, and look forward to our future close relationship with the Royal Australian Air Force.”
In 1944, the aircraft was assigned to USAAF pilot Second Lieutenant Charles Anderson. During a mission the Hell’N Pelican II hit bad weather and made a forced landing near Amaiamon village in Madang Province, PNG. The pilot and the other crew member, USAAF gunner Sergeant John McKenna, managed to escape.
The aircraft was hidden by vegetation for the next three decades until it was located by an Australian Defence Force team, transported to Australia and restored by a specialist team from the Royal Australian Air Force.
The Hell’N Pelican II had been on display in the Aviation Heritage Centre at RAAF Base Amberley since 1996 until a suitable location to permanently house the aircraft in PNG was established.
The 5th USAAF was established in Townsville on February 5, 1942, when it was moved to Australia as part of a transformation of Garbutt Airfield to become a major staging post for combat missions."

The signing of a Memorandum of Agreement between the PNGUoT and PNG Defence Force’s Joint Forces Academy on Friday, June 6th, will ensure students undergo character building and disciplinary training at Igam Barracks.
On June 3rd, 2024, 67 students from the PNGUoT embarked on a gruelling weeklong military boot camp at Igam Barracks.
The inaugural program was a first-of-its-kind concept, initiated by PNGUoT in alignment with its vision to grow world-class technocrats who will not only have the intellectual capability but also the right mindset and attitude.

Court Denies Rapists’ Plea to Stay at Boroko Cell,11/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4824,"The Boroko Holding Cell keeps perpetrators who are awaiting court for their first appearance, and when their matter is heard in court, they are required to be remanded at Bomana prison, says District Court Magistrate Albert Daniels.
Daniels said this after refusing a request from one of the alleged rapists, Constable Danny Karayo, who made a verbal application to be kept at the Boroko Holding Cell rather than Bomana prison.
“Your oral application seeking remand at Boroko goes against the normal protocol of using the Boroko Cell.  Boroko Cell is a facility that keeps those awaiting court for the first time. It simply means that when you are remanded at Boroko, you are required to appear in court the next day.
“However, your request to be remanded at Boroko for two months is against protocol, and the court will not allow that,” Daniels said.
In response, Karayo, said multiple disciplinary actions were taken against him and his co-accused. For this reason, he asked the court to exercise its mercy and keep them at Boroko Cell.
In response, Daniels reminded him again that there are protocols in place that require him and the others to follow.
“The best approach you should take is to file a formal application outlining the issues and the reasons. The court will then act on your application to make its decision,” Magistrate Daniels added.
Karayo, and co-accused Carl Yori, and Jerry Aura were arraigned yesterday for allegedly involved in raping a 22-year-old woman at the Saraga Police Post on June 03, 2025."

PNG and Australia Lead Regional Effort to Improve Anaesthetic Care,11/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4819,"In a significant step towards improving anaesthetic care, doctors from Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH), School of Medicine and Health Sciences (SMHS) and Australia and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) conducted the Safer Anaesthesia From Education (SAFE) Paediatric and Obstetrics Anaesthesia Courses in Honiara last week.
This initiative aims to equip healthcare professionals with essential skills to manage high-risk paediatric and obstetric patients safely and efficiently.
The World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologist (WFSA) SAFE Paediatric and Obstetrics Anaesthesia Courses are designed for both anaesthetic professionals and healthcare workers involved in paediatric and obstetric care. Given the heightened risks associated with these age groups, especially in low-middle income countries, such training and upskilling is crucial. The course covers:
- Early identification of complications, management, and stabilisation
- Resuscitation techniques
- Airway techniques
- Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced Life Support (ALS) for critically ill patients who will undergo anaesthesia for surgery. The principles can also be applied to patients not undergoing surgery where necessary.
Following successful training sessions in Port Moresby last year, the SAFE course is now being conducted in collaboration with the Anaesthetic Department of the National Referral Hospital in Honiara.
A team comprising of three specialists from PNG and four from Australia facilitated the workshops successfully.
More than 50 healthcare professionals enrolled and participated in the SAFE workshops.
This initiative reflects the commitment of PMGH and the Society of Anaesthetists of Papua New Guinea (SAPNG) to enhancing anaesthetic practices across Papua New Guinea and the neighbouring Pacific Islands.
The goal is to reduce anaesthetic-related mortality, morbidity, and near misses while fostering a stronger network of skilled anaesthetists and health professionals.
As the training progresses, the emphasis on collaborative learning, networking, and shared expertise is expected to strengthen anaesthetic care across the region, benefiting both healthcare providers and their patients."

Recently, a Media Education Seminar 2025, organized by Fr. Ambrose Pereira together with several volunteers and media personnel has provided such an avenue, hosting monthly programs since February focusing on various aspects of media.
From the 6-7th of June, a Media Education Seminar held at the Sivarai Namona Pastoral Centre at Bomana, brought together students from five education institutions: Marianville Secondary School, Jubilee Catholic Secondary School, Limana Vocational, Mary Help of Christians Vocational Education Training (FODE Centre), and Don Bosco Technological Institute.
The first session commenced with a talk on ‘Alcohol and Substance Abuse’ and its impact on the human brain. This was presented by Lorraine Angham, a medical expert from the Directorate of Social Change and Mental Health Services. She discussed the harmful effects of betel nut, explaining how its consumption, like that of other substances, negatively impacts the brain.
A mass was held on Saturday where Fr Ambrose highlighted the importance of God in our lives. He encouraged the celebration of the sacraments, especially the sacrament of marriage, urging participants to live lives of total commitment and joy, echoing the gospel reading of the day.
The subsequent sessions included presentation on storyboarding and storyline development. Participants then moved through practical exercises: creatively planning their storylines and storyboards (pre-production), shooting their films (production), and editing (post-production), before finally viewing, and evaluating their completed films."
Madang Traffic Office gets facelift,10/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4814,"It was a milestone achievement for police in Madang province to finally open their refurbished Traffic Office. The community and contractors came out to witness the occasion alongside staff and management of Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd (MCC) through its mining entity Ramu NiCo. MCC funded the project. The refurbishment included new roofing irons and materials with the inclusion of new furniture.
The old Traffic Office stood the test of time since it first went up in the 1960s. Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim said he grew up seeing the Traffic Office disintegrate with time. Now that he was commanding the Madang Police force, the office needed a facelift.
This refurbishment project was initiated by PPC Baim and Traffic Officer In Charge, Frank Makora with support from the Office of the Madang Governor. Ramu NiCo came through with funding after the governor’s office organized the partnership.
Ramu NiCo Community Affairs General Manager Eric Kuman, on behalf of MCC and Ramu NiCo, stated that this is a well-deserved project. Traffic officers can perform their duties better and also assist in other community policing efforts within the town area.
The construction work was contracted to landowner company Raibus Engineering Ltd. They took two months to complete it. It was the first time for a local company to partner with a government agency in service delivery."
MAF’s New aircraft in service,10/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4813,"The newest aircraft that joined Mission Aviation Fellowship last week, P2-AFD, officially launched into service by delivering patients, passengers, fresh produce and vital supplies to some of the country’s most isolated communities in just a few days from arriving.
Markus Bischoff who pilots the aircraft completed its first three days of operations in the rugged Telefomin region. From landing at hard-to-reach bush airstrips including Busilmin, Tekin, Wobagen which rely on air transport to Yokona, which is operatorial since less than 2 years ago.
“Busilmin is one of the really remote bush communities with a well-established but demanding airstrip,” said Bischoff. “We can’t go there often due to weather. It’s really ‘out bush’. This time there were health and education workers flying out to Telefomin—more traffic than usual.”
Yokona made an impression as the first place to get the new aircraft visibly muddy.
“It was so dirty, I actually felt bad about getting out there!” Bischoff said. “It’s a very remote and isolated community. Four people went out for work, and there was one patient and a guardian going to the Telefomin hospital.”
“These flights are the community’s economic lifeline,” Bischoff explained. “They’re not as dramatic as medevacs, but they help people earn an income, pay school fees, access healthcare, and afford flights. Even though Wobagen and Tekin are just as remote as places like Yokona, they’re better off because of that economic flow.”
With few or no roads in the region, and only one route under construction between Tabubil and Telefomin, aviation remains the only practical connection to the outside world.
Bischoff expressed that it’s a rewarding experience to help remote communities.
“You can really see the impact. Around Telefomin, it’s about the basics—rice, education, medical care. What we do isn’t just convenient. It’s life changing,” he said.
P2-AFD is the latest addition to MAF’s Papua New Guinea fleet joining an existing fleet of nine Cessna Caravan aircraft and one amphibious C208."

No deep-sea mining in PNG,10/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4809,"At the Third United Nations Oceans Conference (UNOC3), underway this week in Nice, France, Prime Minister James Marape has stated his government’s stance on Deep Sea Mining.
In the conference attended by 148 world leaders, Marape confirmed that PNG will not carry out Deep Sea Mining, underscoring the lack of research and available data in this space.
“On deep sea mining, our country subscribes to prevent deep sea mining in our EEZ zones (Exclusive Economic Zones), especially in the absence of robust scientific evidence regarding its environmental impact and foot print,” Marape told the conference.
The Prime Minister also reiterated his call for major carbon emitters to remain committed to the Paris Agreement in order to prevent further ocean degradation and also ensure the world keeps within the 1.5 degree Celsius temperature goal of the agreement.
He also expressed disappointment in the slow response by the international community to assist countries like Papua New Guinea who have done so much in the forest sector to mitigate climate change.
“Despite Papua New Guinea’s unwavering commitment and efforts for the forest sector as an answer to mitigate climate change, we remain seriously concerned that the extensive work done in the forest sector under the Paris Agreement has yet to see any tangible returns for us from the international community, so far. This is most disappointing, to say the least. We can do better,” said the Prime Minister.
Prime Minister in delivering Papua New Guinea’s national statement to the Conference on 9 June outlined PNG’s ocean biodiversity and how important the ocean is the people.
“Papua New Guinea as a large maritime and archipelagic nation with around 2.8 million square kilometers of maritime territory, and at the heart of the Coral Triangle, is home to 7 per cent of global biodiversity, one-third of the world’s tuna stocks, and the fourth largest coral reef system on the planet. PNG must ensure there is strategic leadership in the country to make sure that our maritime zones, including exclusive economic zone and its resources, are better protected and used sustainably for the country’s benefit now and for future generations.
“The ocean is not just a resource, it is the lifeblood of our people, our culture, our identity and our economy”.
He also highlighted work done by the government so far in protecting oceans.
“ It has enacted the Marine Protected Areas Act targeting 30 percent marine protection by 2030, with over 17,000 square kilometres already designated; strengthened fisheries management under the enhanced regional cooperation and zone-based management; and intensified efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
This is in addition to becoming a State Party to the Port State Measures Agreement, besides preparing to ratify the World Trade Organization Fisheries Subsidies Agreement later this year,” he stated."

The milestone was officially announced by Party Leader and Prime Minister, James Marape, as preparations begin for nationwide commemorations.
Founded in 1967, the PANGU Party—short for Pangu Pati (Papua and New Guinea Union Party)—played a central role in the country’s road to independence in 1975 and has since remained a significant force in shaping PNG’s political landscape.
“This year, we celebrate 58 years of PANGU leading from the front—championing the dreams of our people, standing for independence, and now advancing a strong, economically independent Papua New Guinea,” Marape said.
The Prime Minister acknowledged the legacy of founding leaders like Sir Michael Somare, who used the party as a vehicle to advocate for self-rule and national unity.
“PANGU is more than a political party—it is a symbol of the enduring spirit and will of Papua New Guineans to take ownership of our destiny,” he added.
Under the current leadership, PANGU has emphasized grassroots development, economic reform, education, and agriculture revival—policies Marape says reflect the party’s founding mission to empower ordinary citizens.
“As we celebrate this anniversary, we also look forward—to building a modern PNG where opportunity reaches every corner of the country.”
Events are expected to be held in various provinces, including the party’s birthplace in Morobe Province, with community gatherings, cultural performances, and speeches reflecting on PANGU’s journey and vision.
The 58th anniversary comes at a time when the party continues to lead the coalition government, with Prime Minister Marape pledging to uphold the values of unity, independence, and service to the people."

What is your contribution?,09/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4799,"People tend to blame politicians for everything that is going wrong in this country. But what are their contributions to PNG’s development?
Acting Prime Minister and Lae MP, John Rosso, asked this during Lae’s launch of PNG’s 50th independence anniversary celebrations on Saturday, June 7th.
Aside from the launch, an auction for limited edition shirts was also held, where companies bid to sponsor PNG-designed shirts for primary and secondary schools in Lae.
At the event, the Lae MP said that while PNG has a long way to go, its citizens need to take ownership and contribute to positive growth instead of blaming the government for everything that goes wrong.
“A lot of people blame politicians, and I agree. Yes, we accept some of the blame,” Rosso stated. “Not all. But if all of us – every individual – us, I should do my job better; all politicians. We should make better decisions for the people we represent. But the bureaucrats, we need to do our jobs better too. And ordinary citizens, business people – everyone.
“For example, if everyone stopped throwing litter; just one little thing.
“Don’t you hate it when you’re driving behind a PMV bus and everyone just opens the window and chuck a mouthful of buai and bag of rubbish out?
“If all of these people stop throwing rubbish, the country wouldn’t need a garbage man.”
The Lae MP pointed out the illegal water and power connections that cost millions of Kina in losses, or the destruction of public properties, especially light poles and bus stop shelters. He emphasised that these are services and infrastructure that citizens should have taken ownership of, instead of damaging. This attitude problem has added to the setback experienced in the country.
“Everyone points fingers at everyone else, but no one takes responsibility for themselves. No one looks back and says, ‘I could’ve done better’. The guys at 11-Mile, cutting the power poles that we have put up for streetlights. Did the politician cut it?” asked the Lae MP.
“The guy who holds up the St John Ambulance when they are doing a voluntary service to go there. Did the politician hold them up?
“If we all change our attitudes, this place would be 10 times better.”
As PNG moves towards the next 50 years, the Lae MP stressed that the challenge is on all of us to ensure that we do the right thing for our people."

Saraga Rape Case - Officer Involved Was a Convict,08/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4777,"Police working to establish facts into the rape of a woman at Saraga Police Post have discovered a big failure in the police force – one of the officers involved in the rape, Constable Danny Karaio was convicted by the courts in 2012 and should be serving time in jail, instead was in police uniform working at the Saraga Police Post.
Police Commissioner David Manning revealed this in statement today while providing an update to the public on the ongoing investigation into the rape of a woman while in custody at the Saraga Police Post outside Six Mile.
Commissioner Manning has confirmed an immediate Inquiry is underway by Assistant Commissioner of Police (Internal Affairs). The Inquiry is directed to determine how karaio, sentenced in 2012 to more than 14 years imprisonment, was not still in prison, obtained a uniform and had been acting under the command of a supervising officer.
“Initial facts established by the Inquiry have revealed an unacceptable failure by Karaio’s commanding officers when he was convicted in 2012.
“Karaio’s supervising officers at the time, the Metropolitan Superintendent, and the Divisional Commander NCD, failed to ensure he was dismissed from the Force.
“They failed the Police Force and they failed our public.
“This individual was sentenced to imprisonment in 2012 for a period of more than 14 years. His commanding officers at the time had a duty to ensure that all actions were taken to ensure he could never wear a uniform again.
“This is a clear and disgraceful dereliction of duty from Commissioned Officers who owed our public better when this member was arrested in 2010 and when he was convicted in 2012.
“By operation of law, this individual had no place in the Police Force. By operation of Standing Orders, his supervising officers had a duty to ensure he was removed from the Force. By common decency, any member aware of his actions should have ensured he was removed from uniform and put behind bars.
“I expect that officers responsible for the supervision of this individual in 2012 would have done more to protect our community.”
Commissioner Manning confirmed that disciplinary processes introduced in recent years have strengthened the accountability of supervising officers, ensuring that any officer derelict in their duty is held to account.
“It saddens me that such a terrible incident has occurred because of a failure by officers to do their jobs a decade ago. This is unacceptable.
“Every member involved in these disgraceful shortcomings is being held to account under our strengthened accountability measures.
“Each and every officer who failed to stop this disgraceful individual is responsible for this shameful incident occurring.  More arrests will be made and charges laid.
“My message to supervising officers is clear.  You are responsible for the conduct of those under your command.  If you fail to prevent criminal conduct, you will be held responsible.”
Commissioner Manning noted the circulation of some false information on social media.
“I call on the public to be wary of posts that are simply based on rumour and rely on official information.”
Meantime, a manhunt is underway for the fourth suspect in the rape case.
The Commissioner said three arrests have been made with police closing in on a fourth individual with door-to-door searches being carried out.
“The manhunt for the auxiliary member allegedly involved in the rape of a woman at the Saraga Police Post is still underway,” the Commissioner said.
“Police are moving through densely populated settlement areas, and it is only a matter of time until he is located and arrested.”"

Tobe and his committee members are hopeful that consistency will be maintained throughout the year and onwards, until a President is elected. Since 2019, externally sponsored tournaments and competitions have been keeping young rugby enthusiasts entertained within Madang province.
Currently, MRL is occupying the Ron Albert Oval, owned by PNGRFL, to run the 9s preseason, which ended last Sunday with the 13s proper season to kick-start the weekend.
The eight clubs awaiting matches are: Hawks, Royals, Panthers, DWU Takara 1, Dom United, Triskelion, RD Dolphins, and 6A brothers.
The committee emphasized that after the pre-season, an overwhelming number of responses followed suit for team registrations. However, not all have been selected, and even some teams from pre-season were dropped due to committee requirements.
Tobe said these requirements were necessary to ensure that teams with a good player base are maintained for consistency. Teams that were dropped are encouraged to join other selected teams in the competition.
The selection criteria are:
•	Player Base – all clubs are required to have a Senior Team (A Grade), Under 21 (B Grade), and a Women's team. With a minimum of 20 players in each team, 60 in a club
•	Must have a training field for training
•	Registrations paid on time – club registration due on May 31st, with a separate K20 fee per player as insurance to PNGRFL
•	Attitude – a major key requisite. The death of the league was mainly due to violence and attitude problems, both from players and spectators.
Today, the executive committee met with selected clubs ahead of the start. An extension was given for the K20 player registration, which is due next Wednesday before the matches begin."
Trump warns Musk of 'serious consequences' if he backs Democrats at midterms,08/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4772,"US President Donald Trump has warned Elon Musk could face ""serious consequences"" if his former ally and campaign benefactor tries to help Democrats in upcoming elections.
Mr Trump told NBC in a phone interview that he had no plans to repair the relationship, which ended in a spectacular, and very public, breakdown this week.
A slight easing of tensions came on Saturday, when Mr Musk deleted a social media post linking Mr Trump to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
However, when he was asked specifically if he thought his relationship with the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX was over, Mr Trump responded, ""I would assume so, yeah.""
The president also issued a warning amid speculation that Mr Musk could back Democratic candidates in the 2026 midterm elections.
He did not say what those consequences would be.
As a major government contractor, Mr Musk's businesses could be particularly vulnerable to retribution.
Mr Trump has already threatened to cut Mr Musk's contracts, calling it an easy way to save money.
""I gave him a lot of breaks, long before this happened, I gave him breaks in my first administration, and saved his life in my first administration, I have no intention of speaking to him,"" he said.

Pacific Prefab Homes enters market with unique designs,07/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4764,"As the demand for better and affordable housing increases in the country, Pacific Prefab Homes has entered the market to help address this with the first three designs of their prefabricated homes out for display at Six Mile in Port Moresby. Going a step further, Prefab Homes has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with TISA Bank and has a financing arrangement with TISA for first time home buyers.
Under this financing arrangement, the first 100 home buyers can do a 10 per cent deposit with TISA Bank with an interest rate of 5.5 per cent per annum over a 40-year period. This financing arrangement is available to persons with registered land.
“Pacific Prefab House has a MOU with TISA Bank for first time home owners. As you can tell, it’s a good investment for a typical regular PNG employee. That instead of renting out a house, you have that option to invest and TISA’s there to help,” PPH Sales Consultant Biena Tejano-Woolcott said.
For the start, Pacific Prefabricated Homes is offering three different designs – the 93 square meter 3-bedroom home, the 135 square meter 3-bedroom home with a study and the premium 199 square meter 4-bedroom home. All houses come with an ensuite and a laundry room downstairs with a toilet, designed to cater for visitors or large gatherings, to suit the need of PNG families.
“Our prefab homes are made to the weather, the culture, and how we envision the type of PNG family will live in and it includes a big family – having everybody come over. So that’s why our homes have large verandahs, very open living room space and a downstairs area where the family can gather and enjoy together,” Woolcott explained.
Mrs Woolcott says the houses were carefully tailored to suit the tropical PNG climate with a four-layer insulation to withstand heat and is termite proof among others.
“So we have certification for earthquake proving, termite proving, and also water proving and fire intensity.
“We can withhold intensity nine (9) for earthquake, level 1.5 or 1.5 hours resistance for fire and resistance of 12 knots for the wind,” Mrs Woolcott added.
Once a home is purchased, it will take 30 days to be constructed in the factory overseas, 30 days for shipping and three weeks to install. Installation fees are separate but PPH can provide a site manager at a certain cost to manage the installation process.
PPH launched its homes on the 29th of May and looks to expand its designs to include, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and classrooms in the near future."

Juffa urges government to stop seabed mining,07/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4760,"Northern Governor Gary Juffa is urging all Members of Parliament (MPs) especially those of coastal and island provinces to consider their people's livelihoods before endorsing and embracing seabed mining.
Governor Juffa expressed his concern in reaction to news of an MOU signing between the New Ireland Provincial Government and the consequential announcement that the New Ireland Provincial Government was ready to embrace seabed mining.
Governor Juffa urged the National Government and Acting New Ireland Governor Walter Schnaubelt to put a stop to the discussions surround seabed mining in New Ireland Province and sanction a thorough investigation by independent experts into the ramifications and repercussions of such activities on the ocean floor where sensitive ecosystems that are crucial to life in the ocean exist.
He added that the consequences on the plight of people who depend on the ocean for their livelihoods have to be understood.
“I recall that in the initial stages of the efforts of the predecessor Nautilus in their failed first attempt, there were some serious concerns raised by communities of New Ireland about the unusual reactions they experienced such as dead fish floating in their shores and murkiness and muddying of the pristine waters of New Ireland around the areas where Nautilus was operating. Meanwhile I recall sometime in August 2012 that a petition by coastal communities mainly from New Ireland of 18,000 signatures was presented to the then Mining Minister Byron Chan to stop seabed mining by Nautilus over environmental concerns. I was there. Nothing eventuated from that petition. Nautilus went ahead. Supported by the then O’Neill Government that also handed them a check of K300m public funds. Nautilus eventually went bankrupt and no effort was made to recoup these monies. Now they are back as a rebranded entity for a second bite and this should not be entertained. This Government should not allow this to happen again.”
Governor Juffa urged Schnaubelt and all MPs to carry out their own research into the potential hazards of seabed mining as warned by eminent scientists worldwide.
“The unknowns are too significant to ignore”.
He stated that many developed economies had refused seabed mining in their waters for this very reason. PNG is a developing nation that does not possess the technology or means to be able to adequately mitigate any risks posed by seabed mining.
“The previous impact assessment was deemed by scientists such as Dr Helen Rosenbaum and Dr Stephan Simpson as being “inadequate” as it did not carry out any assessment on the impact on the pelagic areas of the ocean where the project would be carried out. According to scientists, the pelagic areas are where life vents form whereby very sensitive organisms are produced and thrive which are vital chains in the ocean ecosystems. We cannot ignore this,” said Governor Juffa."

Students producing weapons in technical schools,06/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4757,"A family is still grappling with the shock of losing their son; a young man filled with hopes and dreams.
The Grade 12 student, from Utmei Secondary School, in East New Britain, had around four more months to go before he would close the chapter on secondary education, and move to the next chapter of his life.
Sadly, he succumbed to a head injury on Tuesday, June 3rd, after allegedly being attacked by retaliating students from Don Bosco Technical Secondary School on Thursday, May 29th. This was the final day of the three-day athletics meet at the Kalabond Oval, in Kokopo.
The incident has sparked outrage, with citizens calling for tougher penalties on the perpetrators, who were fined K2,000 by the court on Monday, June 2nd. Failure to meet the fine would lead to one-year detention, each, at Kerevat Prison.
“Parents sacrifice so much to send their children to school, only to see them cut up,” said Rabaul resident and women’s advocate, Susie McGrade.
“And I don’t think there is enough school discipline practiced by the school authorities. Well done to the police for locking everyone up. And they should continue. Not just locking up some but all of them.
“If a student acts with adult criminal intent then they should face adult criminal consequences.
“These sort of incidents are destroying the community. We have now become fractured.
“Vital policy must be made now to avoid such tragic incidents.""
“The parents of this boy must be absolutely devastated and it will take a long time for the community amd the school’s environment to get over this. I am absolutely seriously concerned for us all going forward.”
Prominent national athlete, Takale Tuna, who hails from Matupit, in East New Britain, passed his condolences to the parents and family for the loss of a young life.
“Rather than stopping or suspending school carnivals, investigations must be carried out to find the root cause of such violence,” he outlined.""
“Questions need asking include: What’s motivating young people to resort to violence to solve problems? Why are there so much weapons of destruction in our educational institutions and communities?
“Cultural and Christian values that have been the cornerstone of the ENB society for centuries must be brought back into our classrooms and communities to bring back discipline and respect for authorities. This is to ensure our future generations are well equipped to face challenges they encounter rather than resorting to violence.”
Meantime, Kokopo Police Station Commander, Senior Inspector Neil Weiba, expressed concern that technical students have been using school workshops to weld or construct weapons.
“They have been modifying weapons, homemade guns and other offensive weapons which we have found at that time and confiscated,” he stated, alluding to the May 29th altercation that led to the detainment of over 200 students.""
“We found out that all those weapons were made in their workshop. Those weapons were made to kill.""
“I’m blaming the school administration for not properly supervising students.”"
Three police officers arrested following abuse of community trust,06/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4756,"Police Commissioner David Manning, has expressed disgust at the actions of four police officers following reports of a woman being raped at Saraga Police Post.

""Following the release of the man, it is alleged that two constables and an auxiliary member raped the woman. It is further alleged that the Officer in Charge knew what occurred and did nothing to stop the men who were under his command.
""Last night, Thursday 5 June, the victim of this crime reported the matter to OIC Vision City Police Post and Police moved swiftly to arrest the four police officers involved.
""Constable Jerry Aura and Constable Danny Karaio were immediately arrested on suspicion of rape. The supervising officer, Sgt Karl Yori, was also arrested and is being charged with related offences.

""Specialist investigative units are currently processing the crime scene at Saraga Police Post, while briefs of evidence are prepared for the Courts.
""Investigators are supported by policing advisors from the Australian Federal Police to ensure that all investigative avenues are pursued.""
Commissioner Manning expressed his outrage at the actions of those sworn to protect the community.
""Those involved in criminal offences are a minority of personnel that tarnish the reputation of the force and the majority of hardworking Police throughout the country.
""A Police Station is a safe place and anyone being brought in must be protected and treated with respect and dignity.
""A completely disgusting and dangerous criminal act is how I describe it.
""The arrest of the Officer in Charge of these members reflects the Constabulary's commitment to holding supervisors responsible for personnel under their command.
""I am disgusted and outraged at this incident. I share in our community's pain that any police officer would abuse the trust of public. This conduct has no place in our police force or our nation.""
Further information will be released as investigations proceed."

Court refuses Lau’s stay application,06/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4749,"The Supreme Court yesterday dismissed the stay application filed by former Madang Provincial Administrator Frank Lau.
Justice Oagile Bethuel Key Dingake handed down the decision sitting as a single judge
In his application, Mr Lau challenged the National Court’s decision of April 16, 2024, seeking review of  the termination of his employment as the Provincial Administrator (PA) of Madang Province and the appointment of Daniel Aloi as acting administrator.
The National Court dismissed this application on March 15th, 2025.  Lau filed a judicial review at the Supreme Court to review that decision. This judicial review was accompanied by an application for a stay of the decision of April 16, 2024, which will effectively stay the decision of the NEC, and in effect will place him back in office.
Lawyer representing Mr Aloi Martin Kombri said, however, the court refused his application on the basis that the Secretary for the Department of Personnel Management, NEC, and the Madang Governor do not have a good working relationship with Mr Lau.
“The Governor does not have a good working relationship with Lau, the state does not want to continue his relationship with Lau, hence, the application for stay was refused.
“The decision now leaves the substantive appeal to be determined by the court.
“Furthermore, the decision of the court effectively means that Lau will no longer assume the office has the PA for Madang. The Acting appointment for Daniel Aloi is effectively confirmed by this decision, meaning Aloi is the Acting PA for Madang,” Kombri added."
Planting for the future,06/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4744,"Today, TotalEnergies EP PNG Ltd (TotalEnergies) as Operator of the Papua LNG project, participated in the World Environment Day 2025 event organized by the National Capital District Commission (NCDC), at two different locations in Port Moresby.
As part of the global theme 'Ending Global Plastic Pollution,' the Project donated 500 native trees from eight different species and 100 mangrove seedlings. These will be planted around Port Moresby, with mangroves specifically planted along Kanudi.
Public Affairs Manager for TotalEnergies, Richard Kassman in his remarks highlighted TotalEnergies pride in being a part of the worldwide momentum to develop projects, pioneering initiatives towards a low carbon economy to beat plastic pollution.
“We are proud to present to Powes Parkop, eight species of native trees such as Okari, Rosewood, Kwila, Kapiak including one mangrove species, Avicennia marina that will be planted at Kanudi,” he said.
Papua LNG values building on its collaborative stakeholder partnerships. This has been reflected in the Project’s donation and participation in past World Environment Day activities, when the Project donated 500 trees to NCDC in 2023 and over 3000 mangrove seedlings to organisations and businesses in NCD areas, for planting, conservation and rehabilitation.
Coastal mangrove forests remove five times more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, than terrestrial forests. The Project is excited to work with NCDC and be a part of the Kanudi Mangrove Restoration Site.
Papua LNG emphasizes that it is committed to developing an exemplary Project with a strong focus on protecting the environment and enhancing biodiversity. The Project’s Zero Net Deforestation (ZND) objectives are well aligned with the NCDC’s own objectives to plant 1 million trees around Port Moresby in the next 10 years.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop whilst ceremoniously receiving the tree seedlings, acknowledged TotalEnergies for partnering with NCDC and for the mangrove rehabilitation and restoration program.
“You are a good corporate citizen of our city, but more importantly, I want to thank you all for supporting the Million trees campaign. Let’s imagine Port Moresby all green and with trees everywhere. Cooling the city and changing the ecology,” he said."
Trash to Treasure Sculpture Festival Launched,06/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4742,"Port Moresby Nature Park has launched the BSP Trash to Treasure Sculpture Festival—a month-long celebration of creativity, conservation, and community, officially opening on World Environment Day, June 5th, 2025.
Running until July 5, the festival features towering sculptures of birds, marine animals, and reptiles—all made from solid waste collected across the city. The BSP-sponsored event aligns with this year’s World Environment Day theme, “End Plastic Pollution.”
The festival highlights the urgent need to address plastic waste through education and public engagement, using art as a powerful medium. Each sculpture was brought to life by student volunteers from the University of Papua New Guinea under the guidance of the Nature Park’s dedicated Marketing and Site teams.
BSP Group GM Corporate Affairs & Community, Hari Rabura said, “At BSP, we’re proud to support this initiative that connects communities through environmental storytelling and innovative recycling. It turns pollution into purpose.”
Visitors can enjoy the sculptures every day, with weekday school excursions and Family Fun Day events every Saturday, which include craft-making sessions, park tours, and eco-awareness activities.
UPNG Deputy Director of Residence and Catering, Robinson Lanza, “Our students are passionate about this cause. It’s a chance for them to lead by example and promote sustainable action through art. It also allows them to do something outside of their scope of study at school.”
The goal is to inspire families, schools, and businesses to rethink waste management and embrace recycling for a cleaner PNG.
“These sculptures are more than art—they’re a call to action for all Papua New Guineans to take responsibility for our environment and to teach the younger generation to be more aware of the opportunity turning their everyday recyclable trash into Treasure.”
The Nature Park invites the public to visit, reflect, and join the movement, turning trash into treasured change for future generations."
Jiwaka submits 2024 APPR Reports,06/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4741,"The Jiwaka Provincial Administration has made a significant stride toward accountability and transparency by submitting its first-ever comprehensive Section 119 Reports, fulfilling a key legislative requirement under the Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Governments today.
The reports, covering the 2023 to 2024 fiscal period, were officially handed over to the Department of Provincial and Local-level Government Affairs (DPLGA) by Jiwaka Provincial Administrator Rick Kogen.
The reports were received on behalf of Secretary Philip Leo by Deputy Secretary for the Provincial and Local Level Services Monitoring Authority (PLLSMA), James Agigo.
Kogen acknowledged the collaborative efforts of technical officers from both the Jiwaka Provincial Administration and DPLGA, who worked diligently to compile the reports under Section 119. He emphasized that this submission marks a turning point for the province since its establishment in 2012.
“From 2012 to 2022, no Section 119 reports were submitted to the DPLGA or the Minister. Under the current government and administration, we have produced and submitted our first comprehensive report for the 2023 to 2024 fiscal years. This is a proud moment for Jiwaka,” Kogen said.
He stated that the province is committed to strengthening governance systems and infrastructure development across key sectors including education, health, law and justice, transport, and economic development. These efforts are aligned with the 21 Strategic Areas, 12 Specific Areas, and 71 Deliberate Intervention Programs of the PNG Medium Term Development Plan IV (MTDP IV) 2023–2027.
“We have made notable progress over the last two years, and I am proud to report our achievements. This report is not just a compliance measure—it is a reflection of our service delivery and commitment to the people of Jiwaka,” Kogen added.
Deputy Secretary Agigo reiterated the importance of timely submissions, noting that June 30 is the annual deadline for all Provincial Governments to submit their Annual Provincial Government Performance Reports (APGPR).
“These reports must reflect performance across six key Minimum Priority Areas: Education, Health, Transport and Works, Primary Industry, Law and Justice, and Governance. They provide crucial insights into how provincial administrations are delivering essential services,” Agigo said.
He praised Jiwaka’s leadership and encouraged other provinces to follow suit.
In the recent May Parliamentary sitting, DPLGA Minister Soroi Eoe tabled a consolidated APGPR for 2018–2022, highlighting widespread non-compliance with Sections 114 and 119 of the Organic Law. He emphasized that these reports are not mere formalities, but essential tools to assess the impact of government in rural and underserved areas.
“For far too long, many provinces have neglected this responsibility. This has contributed to the ongoing lack of vital services like health clinics, functioning schools, and safe roads in remote communities. We must do better,” said Minister Eoe.
The submission by Jiwaka sets a new standard for provincial accountability and reinforces the importance of reporting as a tool for inclusive and sustainable development across Papua New Guinea."
Drug offenders urge to seek legal help,05/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4738,"District Court drug offenders seeking assistance from the Public Solicitor’s office are urged to represent themselves or seek help from private law firms due to a shortage of lawyers.
Waigani District Court Magistrate Tracy Ganaii said this when speaking to a drug offender in court recently.
Upon advice from the Public Solicitor's office, Ganaii said most of the lawyers are attending to National and Supreme Court matters, with limited lawyers to attend to District Court matters.
“So this means that you will have to represent yourself in court or seek help from a private lawyer to assist you in court,” she said.
She said the purpose of the court is to appeal to drug offenders to seek help due to the increasing number of drug cases that are piling up in court.
“The court needs the assistance of lawyers and prosecutors to identify the facts of the cases, and also identify the effects of drugs in society, as well as the individual circumstances of the offender.
The court must balance it out and make a fair decision.
“There are various reasons for using drugs, some take drugs to sell, others take drugs to smoke. However, the penalties for offenses involving drugs have increased, therefore, offenders need representation to represent them in court,” Magistrate Ganaii added."

ACT NOW demands action on log export price discrepancy,05/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4735,"Community advocacy organisation ACT NOW is calling on the Prime Minister and regulatory agencies to take urgent action to address the huge discrepancies in log export values revealed in a recent report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
The UNODC findings, which are based on official PNG log export monitoring reports and Chinese customs data, show that foreign-owned logging companies could be defrauding the PNG government and resource owners out of billions of Kina in revenues.
The report reveals that the value of logs exported from PNG, as declared by the logging companies, is 50 per cent lower than the value of the same logs as declared in China by the importing companies.
From 2018 to 2022, the difference in value between the prices declared in PNG and those in China totaled US$1.5 billion, equivalent to over K6 billion at today’s exchange rate.
By undervaluing the logs exported from PNG, logging companies evade paying export taxes to the government and royalties to local communities, as well as corporate taxes by not declaring any profits.
The evidence from the UNODC report echoes comments from the Commissioner of the IRC, Sam Koim, who said in 2021 that logging companies are guilty of “an entrenched level of tax evasion” with “egregious incidents of transfer pricing and under declaration of income.”
“The amounts of money involved are eye-watering,” says ACT NOW Campaign Manager Eddie Tango.
“And the losses to the PNG government and rural communities have been ongoing for decades. It is time for the Prime Minister himself to step in and ensure action is taken.”
ACT NOW is also calling for immediate action by regulatory agencies, the commercial sector and the diplomatic community, including:
•	PNG Forest Authority to stop issuing any further log export permits until a public inquiry is completed;
•	Police fraud squad with the assistance of UNODC and IRC, to open criminal investigations into logging companies suspected of defrauding the State and landowners
•	Commercial banks to stop providing financial services to foreign-owned logging companies
•	Foreign missions, including Japan, EU, France, UK and Australia to support the PNG government in setting up a public inquiry.
“There is extensive and well-documented evidence that logging companies are involved in illegal logging, including the abuse of Forest Clearing Authorities, tax evasion and fraud, money laundering and human rights abuses,” says Eddie Tanago.
“These same problems were revealed in the Barnet Commission of Inquiry way back in 1989 and have plagued our nation since Independence.”
“It is time for the PM, government departments, and commercial banks, with the assistance and support of our overseas friends to bring an end to this scandal.”"
Kikori police handicap to attend to SARV incident,05/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4733,"Kikori Police on Sunday, June 2, 2025, released a report of a Sorcery Accusation Related Violence (SARV) incident where four elderly men were murdered.
The men from various villages within East Kikori, Gulf Province, were killed by the people from Veraibari village on Sunday, May 25, after suspecting them of practicing sorcery.
According to a police report, the community of Veraibari brought the four elderly men, who had been suspected and known for practicing sorcery to be questioned concerning the death of many young men, women and children of Veraibari village (since 2011), and more recently on Friday 23rd May 2025 they buried another young man who they believed died of malaria.
It is alleged that from 2020-2025, a total of 15 people died through sorcery-related accusations.
During the interrogation, the elderly men admitted they had been practicing sorcery to kill these people. They (deceased men) admitted to using crocodiles, dogs, mosquitoes, and snakes to make people sick and cause death to people through sorcery. A long list, containing names of people whom they had killed and those yet to be killed through sorcery, was revealed.
The angry and frustrated relatives and families then used bush knives to chop the men, killing them instantly.
Six local community-based constables (CBCs), who were present to stop the incident were outnumbered, resulting in the death of the men.
Since reporting the incident, the CBCs informed the Kikori police personnel who visited the crime scene and compiled the reports. However, relatives of those killed are yet to come forward to provide statements.
Meanwhile, policemen lack logistics to move within the area to investigate the incident, which remains tense at the moment, according to Gulf Provincial Police Commander, Chief Inspector Jeffrey Lemb.
“It is highly likely there will be tensions between the families of the deceased and the people of Veraibari.
“This is a killing with a bizarre twist. All four men were killed on account of sorcery. It is likely that the next village is going to attack the Veraibari village in revenge. The problem on the ground with the police is fuel. Kikori police have not received fuel from the police headquarters for the last several months,” said PPC Lemb.
“This is only going to get worse if the police cannot get the needed fuel as soon as possible.”
He said Kikori police get fuel directly from the headquarters transport because there is a cargo boat that makes monthly trips from Port Moresby.
“The company helps to freight them. The boat has been waiting, but Transport officers haven't responded to our request for the last two weeks. Follow-ups have been made daily, but we’re still waiting.”"

Advantage of road links,05/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4731,"The linking of roads through Connect PNG will bring people back to their homes, and not just bring more people into the city.
These were the words of Prime Minister James Marape during his response to the Member for Goilala, Casmiro Aia, yesterday in parliament.
Aia was concerned about the discrimination in the city where the people of Goilala have been singled out and targeted by various ethnic groups in the city, the latest being the Waigani incident.
“My people were mistreated at Vadavada, 2-Mile Hill, Tete, Baruni Dump recently, at Bomana, and now at Waigani. Tell me, where is the safest place I can take my people to, if not here, then where?”
Prime Minister James Marape, in an attempt to answer his question, outlined how the Connect PNG program will open up Port Moresby to the Momase and Highlands region through the Trans-National Highway and help in the movement of people back to their provinces of origin.
“Today, you look at a city of millions of people, that is why we are opening our country by roads.
“This is not only to bring people into the city, to our Nation’s capital and surrounding provinces like Gulf and Central, but we will stop people from settling there.
“These roads should get people out who have been in the city for years, some even in their 4-5 generations of families.”
With the frustration of Goilala MPs' question on where his people should be located to find safety, MP Marape stated that people of Goilala should consider going back home, and said this goes generally to all who are unemployed in the city.
“If you have nothing to do in our city, there is enough land in your ancestral home. The opening of the road from Port Moresby to Lae should bring people home.
“I want to thank the member and his district for investing in the two main roads leading to the Goilala mountains. This road is supported by the Works Department. If Port Moresby residency is not good for you, there is always a place in your home, place of origin, where everything is free, you can go to.
“For the 4th-5th generation from Tari or other parts of the country living in the city, when the road opens, if you cannot work in the city, go back home.”
The ""Connect PNG"" program aims to improve infrastructure, particularly roads, to connect remote areas and potentially address unemployment by creating opportunities in rural areas. By linking rural communities to economic centers, the program hopes to facilitate access to essential services and markets, encouraging unemployed individuals to return to their home areas and participate in the local economy.
Furthermore, Prime Minister Marape commended the NCD Governor, Powes Parkop, for installing cameras all over the city.
He said by 2027, Port Moresby and all parts of the country must have cameras, including a link to the Police stations. In this way, there will be a real-time response to incidents."
Motor vehicle owners warned,04/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4726,"Private vehicle owners, PMV operators and Taxi operators are warned to follow basic road safety rules when using public roads in the city, says NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab.
In a statement released earlier, NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Simatab says the ignorance of motor vehicle operations is causing fear in the community, leading to growing danger and disorder in the city.
He said that too many defective and unroadworthy vehicles are causing traffic jams and putting lives at risk, while many are ignoring basic road safety rules, which he said must stop.
Simatab said the command is giving a public notice to allow all drivers and vehicle owners to fix their vehicles or remove them from the road before the police take action effective this week, police will undergo awareness and follow up with arrests and penalties afterwards. He warned vehicle owners to check their cars, PMVs, and taxis.
“If your vehicle is defective, has no brakes, no lights, no registration, or is not roadworthy, take it off the road immediately. This is their chance to fix it before police enforcement begins. Every police officer in NCD — from the Metropolitan Superintendent down to the last Constable — has been instructed to make 5 arrests every month, starting with traffic offences.
He said under the new Road Traffic Act, bail for each traffic offence is K500. He said if one offender is caught and charged with 10 traffic offences, the bail will be K5,000.
The Metsupt said this is a final warning, and police officers will not tolerate the misconduct of motor vehicle owners if caught by the police.
""To every driver, respect the road. Respect other people’s lives. Drive responsibly. Let’s work together to make our roads safer, cleaner, and less congested for everyone, especially our school children, working mothers, and elderly citizens,” Metsupt Simatab said."

Once recommendations are endorsed, the Cabinet will take swift and responsible action to restore stability within ICAC.

We will treat this situation as a structural learning curve and take steps to strengthen ICAC’s leadership and governance frameworks,” said Prime Minister Marape.
He stated that the Government is committed to ensuring ICAC operates with full clarity and independence, alongside the Ombudsman Commission, Police, and other state agencies"

“It’s very serious for students at that age to be in possession of such weapons.”
PSC Weiba further voiced his concern that technical students have been using school workshops to weld or construct weapons.
“They have been modifying weapons, homemade guns and other offensive weapons which we have found at that time and confiscated,” he outlined.
“We found out that all those weapons were made in their workshop. Those weapons were made to kill.
“I’m blaming the school administration for not properly supervising students.”

The Aropa Airport Upgrade Project falls under Phase 2 of the Civil Aviation Development Investment Project (CADIP II), valued at K58.2 million. It is expected to be delivered in 2027.
Acting Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the implementing agency, the National Airports Corporation (NAC), Dominic Kaumu acknowledged the leadership of both governments under the leadership of Prime Minister James Marape and President Ishmael Toroama.
Kaumu stated that public servants make things happen and stand ready to implement, but, “Vision and direction comes from the top.”
He revealed for the first time, NAC we’ll install solar power panels in an effort to promote saving costs. This idea will be replicated in Lae’s Nadzab airport. Discussions are being held with PNG Power Limited to carry out this objective.
“NAC is looking at alternative ways of improving our costs so one of the things we doing, we looking to clean energy. And I am pleased to say that Aropa will be the first airport,” Kaumu stated.

Ms Guan said a team of slope engineers is presently conducting soil and rock sampling as part of the feasibility study.
Meanwhile, the social and environmental team, including Ms. Guan, is advancing awareness and community engagement efforts.
Deputy Provincial Administrator – Corporate Services, John Talele, commended community members for their participation and support.
“This project will help address recurring issues like flooding and soil erosion that severely affect the Karavi and Ranguna areas,” he said.
“Heavy rainfall often renders the road closed, delaying public transport services and cargo from Rabaul. This rehabilitation work will significantly improve travel and delivery times.”
Tiolam Wawaga, local leader and former LLG president of Raluana LLG, urged residents to support the implementation team.
“I encourage all of us to respect and assist those working on this project. Attracting development partners like JICA to our province is no easy task, so let’s work together to ensure its success.”

ENB challenged on 48th anniversary,03/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4703,"The people of East New Britain have been challenged to be agents of change.
ENB Provincial Administrator, Levi Mano, issued the challenge during the commemoration of the East New Britain Provincial Government’s 48th anniversary on Friday, May 31st.
“As you've heard from previous speakers, I don’t think any government program can create change unless the people take it upon themselves to be agents of change,” Mano said.
He urged everyone through the livestreamed program via NBC East New Britain, to get back to the basics of life.
“To the young people in the province, I don't know what good will come from you not listening to your parents and leaders in the community. Because disobedience only leads to bad things happening to you in life,” he outlined.
Mano also encouraged youths to have self respect and to go back to the church.
Representing all the national leaders in the province, Kokopo MP, Ereman Tobaining Junior, said the province’s history tells a story of people’s resilience.
He urged ENB citizens, and especially the younger generation, to be proud that ENB, through its community leaders, started the movement for self rule in the province, which eventually led to PNG gaining independence in 1975.
""To our youths today, we need to change our way of thinking. Likewise parents, your children are your core responsibility, so go back to fixing your family homes first.”
The program initially had additional activities, such as the Choral Festival and presentation of items such as trucks, but that had to be omitted, given some issues experienced at the venue during the week, amidst the inter-secondary school carnival at the Takubar Sports grounds in Kokopo city.
Instead, the program only featured the ENB Scout Association with two choir groups from Navunaram and Kabakada villages from Gazelle district. They choir presentation accompanied speeches from the two leaders, and others such as the provincial church representative and the acting provincial advisor for the Division of Community Development.
Takubar sports grounds was the fallback venue after Gazelle District, as the host of the program, could not prepare in time."
226 recruits pass out,03/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4701,"Two hundred and twenty-six (226) second batch of the 2023 police recruits passed out on Monday, June 2nd at the Bomana Centre of Excellence.
Consisting of 25 females and 201 males, recruits underwent six months of intense training, which qualified them to graduate. They will be serving for 18 months as probationary constables in their respective provinces. They were placed into eight squads.
Presentation of awards was presented to the recruit who stood out from each squad, and the best award was given to a team for their outstanding performance.
Present to witness the ceremony were Deputy Prime Minister and Lae MP John Rosso, Australian High Commissioner to PNG, Fiji High Commissioner to PNG, Police Commissioner David Manning, representatives of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, family and friends.
In addressing the officers, Deputy PM Rosso said the event marks a milestone in their professional journey as police officers, which signifies the continued strength of the constabulary.
“Your presence here signals your readiness to take on one of the most important and challenging roles in our society, to uphold the rule of law and safeguard our people, especially those who need to be protected,” said DPM Rosso.
He said the current police personnel is 70, 000 which is not enough to cater for the 12 to 15 million people. This calls for the recruitment of more police officers.
The Deputy PM urged the recruits to implement the RPNGC Code of Ethics and remember that they had a mandated role to protect the people they serve.
“Your role is not to become the enemy of people but to become the protector of the people of PNG,” he said."
"RTA takes over vehicle registration, driver licensing",02/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4699,"Obtaining or renewing driver’s licences and motor vehicle registration in the Nation’s Capital has become much simpler today with the Road Traffic Authority (RTA) now responsible for these services.
The Government has brought in the reform to be compliant with the Road Traffic Act 2014 and the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act 1974.
In a statement released today, RTA’s Acting Chief Executive Officer, John Avira, said the transition of responsibilities provides motorists with clarity for licensing and registration, and will be rolled out around the nation.
As of 2 June 2025, RTA is the sole authority for:
• New and renewed vehicle registrations;
• Issuance of number plates and changes to ownership, colour, engine or chassis;
• Licensing of all vehicle classes, including PMVs and taxis;
• Driver’s license issuance, upgrades, renewals, and reprints;
• Provision of registration-related consumables (e.g., handbooks, special plates).
Mr Avira said this reform will enable the RTA to focus on our core functions for the public, and Motor Vehicle Insurance Limited’s (MVIL) will focus solely on providing Compulsory Third-Party motor vehicle insurance.
“We all want to ensure that motorists know where to go for the services they need and make life easier in complying with legal requirements.
“MVIL has done a great job in administering these responsibilities since 1996, now RTA is stepping up and taking up these important licensing and registration functions.
“The transition begins in the National Capital District and will expand around the nation.”
Following the transition, all MVIL-issued driver licences and vehicle registration certificates remain valid until their current expiry. Upon expiration, renewals must be completed through RTA.
Vehicles must first be insured by MVIL before being registered or re-registered with RTA.
RTA stated that the legal requirement for Compulsory Third Party insurance has not changed and must be obtained through MVIL before registration or renewal with RTA. Insurance only becomes active once the vehicle is successfully registered.
With the transition only being for NCD, the MVIL will continue its registration and licensing partnerships with provincial governments, except where the function has already been internalised, such as is the case in Morobe, Milne Bay and West New Britain."

A total of 17 players, along with team officials, are set to make the journey.
Finalizing the squad's training remains a top priority to ensure the athletes stay fit and focused on the challenges ahead. PNG is set to compete against teams from six other Pacific islands, including their 2015 South Pacific rivals, American Samoa.
Team manager Nancy Palin expressed gratitude and confidence in the caliber and quality of the players selected for the team.

She emphasized the need for a positive attitude, work ethic, and dedication of players both on and off the field.
""I'd say we have a great group of players. We have several young talents in the team, alongside 5 to 6 members from the 2015 South Pacific Games winning team. Their experience is invaluable for the newer players,"" she added.
Observations from training show that the seasoned players are taking the lead and fostering strong bonds within the team.
As expectations from the Papua New Guinea Olympic Committee (PNGOC), sponsors, and the public continue to rise, Palin is confident that the team will perform admirably for the country, with promising prospects for medals.
One of the primary challenges they face is securing two sets of uniforms from overseas. However, she acknowledges the generous support from various individuals and corporate sponsors who have stepped in to assist the team.
Palin also highlighted the efforts of national women’s coach Ken Selu, based in Canberra, Australia, for his initiatives in preparing the team. She is positive that the uniform situation will be resolved in the next two weeks.
The team has confirmed their travel plans, with departure scheduled for June 26 on an Air Niugini charter. The Games will conclude on July 9, with the team returning on July 10."

""This celebration is more than music and dance. It is about who we are as Melanesians and Pacific peoples—honouring our past, celebrating the present, and walking together into the future,"" said Parkop.
The highlight of the night came after sunset when Pacific music stars took the stage. Amazing acts like Jammin featuring up-and-coming artist Faithy, Kool Rootz, Seru Serevi & Georgina, Westpa Trio, and the POV Band set the stadium on fire. But it was ONETOX from the Solomon Islands who stole the show.
With fans waving flags and dancing from the stadium's bleachers to the field, ONETOX delivered a powerful and emotionally charged performance that had the stadium pulsing with joy. Their signature island sound closed the curtain on the Pacific Story celebrations in an unforgettable fashion.
Organisers hailed the event as a success, noting the overwhelming turnout from the Pacific community and the positive atmosphere that defined the past two weeks.
As Port Moresby continues the countdown to the golden jubilee of independence, events like these have brought communities closer, reminding everyone that the Pacific truly is stronger together, through culture, music, and unity."
Northern Province imposes liquor restrictions,02/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4690,"Ten thousand kina is the fine for non-compliance with liquor restrictions during the LLG elections. The Oro Provincial Government and administration have imposed this in preparation for the 2025 LLG elections.
Provincial administrator Trevor Magei issued this stern warning in light of law and order data obtained from the Provincial Police Command, with a very high frequency of major violent crimes relating to alcohol abuse in the province.
Northern province has been marred by a spike in violent crimes, including 14 murders recorded in May alone, mainly associated with alcohol abuse.
“With guidance from the Provincial Police Command, the Provincial Peace and Good Order committee has unanimously resolved for stringent alcohol trading hours to be implemented and policed during the pre- and post-25 LLG Elections in Oro,” said Magei.
Alcohol restrictions, according to a circular from the Office of the Provincial Administrator, include Monday to Thursday trading restrictions from 0800am to 4 pm or 1600, and a total ban on alcohol trading from Friday to Sunday.
Magei confirmed that licensed outlets that serve alcohol with meals are exempt but must adhere to the no take-away alcohol policy.
“Licensed outlets are allowed to serve alcohol with meals, but patrons are not allowed to take away any alcohol bought from these licensed premises, or they stand to lose their trading Licenses indefinitely,” said Magei.
Northern Governor Gary Juffa has endorsed this measure primarily because of the importance of ordinary citizens to exercise their Constitutional rights to freely cast their votes without fear or intimidation from intoxicated persons or groups.
“This is the one time in five years ordinary citizens are allowed to freely and unintimated privilege to exercise their constitutional right, and my Provincial Government is committed to ensuring this is not derailed by intoxicated political hooliganism,” said Juffa.
“Northern Province does not have a lot of funding, in fact, we are stretched to the limit, but my Provincial Government recognises that for development to be proficiently delivered, there must be functioning Local Level Governments, and OPG funding emulates this message, said Juffa
“I can assure the national and provincial governments, Northern Province is ready for the start of polling come July 27, 2025 and further,” Juffa added."
Over K400mil for Education department,02/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4687,"The Education Department has received K406 million (US$100) from the World Bank to support the Learning Enhancement and Access Project in Papua New Guinea.
The Ministry of Education expresses its gratitude to the Marape/Rosso Government for its undivided support for a World Bank Loan and extends its heartfelt appreciation to the World Bank for its recent approval and release of US$100 million (K406 million) in funding to support the Learning Enhancement and Access Project (LEAP) in Papua New Guinea.
The Learning Enhancement and Access Project (LEAP) is a transformative initiative that aims to improve learning outcomes for children across the country, targeting the foundational years - that is, ECE preparatory, grade 1, and 2.
This critical investment will directly support an estimated 3,500 schools, benefiting approximately 375,000 preparatory to grade 2 and 9,000 teachers, ensuring that every child has the opportunity to thrive in an environment that nurtures their potential.
LEAP will focus on four key pillars:
Preparing children to be ready to learn:
The project will support pilot Early Childhood Education (ECE) initiatives, laying a strong foundation for future learning and aligning with the government’s commitment to expand and formalize ECE in the national education system.
Supporting teachers to teach effectively: LEAP will provide high-quality teaching and learning materials, extensive professional development, and teacher qualification upgrading to equip teachers with the skills and resources they need to succeed.
Modernizing infrastructure and management:
Recognizing the importance of safe, well-equipped learning environments, the project will invest in refurbishing school infrastructure, improving data management systems, and enhancing overall governance in the education sector.
Strengthening project management and capacity-building:
LEAP will support the Department of Education in building strong systems and human resource capacity to ensure effective delivery, monitoring, and sustainability of project activities.
Education Minister Lucas Dekena said this funding shows the World Bank’s trust in our plans for education.
“LEAP will help our teachers and children, and bring hope to communities across Papua New Guinea. Once again, I thank the World Bank for standing with us to improve the future of our children.
“We look forward to signing the agreements and formally launching the project in the coming weeks,” he said.
The project represents the first phase of a 12-year Multiphase Programmatic Approach (MPA), designed to be a scalable and sustainable pathway to achieve significant education reforms and ultimately improve learning outcomes across the country.
LEAP is aligned with the Government’s National Education Plan 2020-2029, the Medium-Term Development Plan IV 2023-27, and the country’s commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all).
The Ministry of Education also acknowledges the ongoing efforts to secure additional funding through the $50 million OPEC Fund and the approximately $10 million grant from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which will bring the total project funding to approximately $160 million once finalized."
ICAC officers linked to misuse of funds,01/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4685,"Two senior officials of the Independent Commission Against Corruption have been referred to the police for independent investigation for alleged involvement in financial misconduct.
Police Commissioner David Manning confirmed on Saturday, May 31st, receipt of a formal referral from ICAC Commissioner Andrew Forbes about the conduct of the senior officers.
The referral includes allegations of financial irregularities and expenditure of public monies not approved by an officer authorised under the Public Finances (Management) Act 1995.
In accordance with established procedures, initial enquiries are being conducted by the Police to inform consideration of the referral by the Sensitive Investigation Board. Where the Sensitive Investigation Board assesses a referral as disclosing suspicion of a criminal offence, the matter will be assigned for independent investigation by the National Fraud & Anti-Corruption Directorate.
It is the expectation of the RPNGC and the Government that all matters relating to the transparent and legal management of public entities be held to the highest standards and scrutiny.
The ICAC was established by the National Parliament to combat corrupt conduct by public officials, public bodies, and corruption by individuals who may receive government funds.
Commissioner Manning said it is appropriate that the anti-corruption watchdog adheres to the expectations of the nation and refers any concerns of its personnel for independent and transparent scrutiny.
“As in all claims made in a referral to the police, any accused is innocent until proven guilty in a Court of law.
“I issue this statement as notice to other parties not to attempt to politicise the work of law enforcement agencies of the nation,” Manning said.
ICAC Commissioner Forbes wishes to make clear that it will not be naming the individuals involved at this stage, to uphold due process and avoid prejudicing ongoing inquiries.
He said ICAC acknowledges and appreciates the support of key government authorities who have been instrumental in ensuring this matter was managed promptly with professionalism and discretion.
Commissioner Forbes reiterates that he does not tolerate misconduct at any level, and when serious allegations arise, they will be subject to appropriate scrutiny."

Autopsy report out – Sandy’s family still shocked,31/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4673,"Six days on and the family of late Sandy Purel are yet to come to terms with her death as shock and grief grips the family.
“We the relatives in the strongest term condemn the way and the manner in which she was killed. It was ruthless, gutless, reckless, action by a rogue and undisciplined policeman. This is the way we would describe it because no human being in the right sense of mind would carry out such an act.
“So this is something that the family cannot take.”
“And for a 29-years old, for her life to go in this manner, it is unacceptable. We cannot comprehend. We are not sure if a normal person did it.”
This is not the end they wanted – all they invested in their daughter for 29 year,  gone in the blink of an eye - at the pull of a trigger from the hand of a trigger-happy policeman.
Morata Bus Stop at Waigani in the nation’s capital was business as usual on that fateful Sunday (25 May 2025) afternoon. The spot was bustling with informal business activities as citizens went about their daily tasks to earn a living in this demanding city.
Sandy and her husband, married just a month ago had returned from Church and were waiting to board the next PMV home to Morata. Unbeknownst to them, tragedy was about to strike.
A police vehicle approached hastily, and everyone was taking cover, especially the informal sellers.  As Sandy and her husband scrambled in the mad rush, Sandy fell and would never rise again to say even a final goodbye.
Autopsy reports revealed the bullet hit her on the right shoulder, penetrated through her chest and out the left shoulder, damaging vital organs in the process.
“So yesterday (Thursday, 29th May), our doctor performed an autopsy or what you call a post-mortem. And I just want the nation to know the cause of the death as per the death certificate that was issued to us and the police.
“Its lacerated trachea, lung bullet wounds and collapsed lungs due to penetrating bullet wound to the right shoulder due to gun shot,” outlined the family spokesman, De Kewanu.
This report weighed down heavily on the family, who have now come out to demand answers from the police.
They want answers on why a gun was used in a public place where there was no imminent danger or threat, there was no fighting or commotion, and what danger the environment there posed for them to use a gun.
“Was there an imminent threat on someone or the policeman’s life? You’re not in a war-torn zone or some centres that are rife with tribal fights. Then you can go armed. But for someone who was minding her own business on a Sunday and for someone to pull the trigger: what threat did she pose? What threat the environment posed? What threat was around for someone to press a trigger? That we can’t take it,” Kewanu stated.
Following her death and after leaving her body at the funeral home, truck loads of men convoyed to the Waigani police station demanding answers.
However, the situation was fast contained as they agreed to allow law to take its course.
“We are from a region where the word of God has settled in a place called Upper Mendi. Let me put it this way - the people that live up there, our DNA is peace. That DNA has overtaken these men here. That DNA has overtaken that society. That DNA called peace has given us five days to come this far. Tell the police hierarchy, tell the nation, tell the police minister, tell the police commissioner that this DNA called peace generates out from these young men that are seated here. Tell the policemen that we visited at almost midnight at Waigani police station in a convoy of vehicles. Tell the nation that that DNA I am speaking about prevailed that night so Port Moresby can be at ease,” Kewanu said.
Kewanu is now calling on the police hierarchy to come forward and provide some explanation. Six days on and he says there is a lack of police presence at the funeral venue.
Labelling the death as one induced by police, they now demand the police department to take on all expenses related to the death."

National Lands Board Chairman Appointment Pending,31/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4671,"With Central Province now having a Physical Planning Board with its chairman in place, Governor Rufina Peter is further calling on the Lands Department to fast track the appointment of the National Lands Board Chairman.
The Lands Act and the Physical Planning Act are the legislations that enable the establishment of the Provincial Lands Board and the Physical Planning Board for provinces.
Physical Planning boards are established under the Physical Planning Act 1989 and are responsible for approving all proposed development plans within the province. They ensure that these plans conform to best land use practices. Whilst a Lands Board is established under the Land Act 1996 and is responsible for managing and allocating land within the province.
The Central Provincial Physical Planning Board members and the Chairman were sworn in last week, following the swearing in of the provincial lands board last year. However, for these boards to fully function and exercise their powers, they need the National Lands Board. And currently, there is a vacancy in the role of the National Land’s Board Chairman.
Therefore, Governor Peter brought this to the attention of the minister responsible.
“These two boards are fundamental to integrated and coherent land development strategies. While the Central Provincial Land Board was sworn in lasty year, we still await the appointment of the National Land Board Chairman to officiate as required under the Land Act. We kindly ask for your support to expedite this appointment and provide ongoing resourcing for both Boards to operate effectively.”
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Lands and Physical Planning and Urbanization, John Rosso, confirmed that the appointment of the National Lands Board Chairman will take place soon.
“Regarding the questions that was raised earlier on, the chairman of the National Land board, the national land board has already been appointed by cabinet and just waiting to be sworn in.

EU-STREIT program transforms rural livelihoods,31/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4669,"The rural community of Maka in West Sepik Province is undergoing a powerful transformation, thanks to the EU-STREIT PNG Programme.
Plagued by low agricultural productivity, lack of market access, and limited services, life in Maka was marked by hardship. Families like Joseph and Damia faced constant struggles—finding school fees, nutritious food, and income was a daily challenge. But the tide has turned.
The EU-STREIT PNG Programme, funded by the European Union and implemented by UN agencies, introduced critical support to revitalise cocoa and aquaculture production. Farmers received pest-tolerant cocoa seedlings, training in cocoa budding and post-harvest practices, and vital equipment including nursery materials and fermentry kits. Over 4,000 cocoa seedlings have now been planted by 40 farmers, breathing new life into Maka’s block fields.
In June 2024, aquaculture support followed, with fingerlings provided to Joseph and Damia, enabling them to grow from one to three fishponds and supply nearby farmers. This has improved local nutrition and created a new income stream.
Market access has also been restored. A new Cocoa Trade and Depot Facility in Vanimo now connects Maka’s produce to buyers, with trucks delivering supplies and transporting cocoa beans. Maka farmers can now process beans in their own fermentry, adding value and boosting profits.
Beyond the economic gains, the programme has reignited hope and self-reliance. Damia’s message to her children is clear: “Do well to have a good future.”
With the Cocoa Board now supporting the nursery and West Sepik Investment Ltd managing the depot facility, the foundation is set for long-term sustainability.
Maka’s transformation is a powerful example of rural revitalisation through resilience, partnership, and strategic investment—aligning with the EU’s Global Gateway vision for inclusive development."
"Japan, PNG Mark 50 Years of Development Partnership",31/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4667,"Papua New Guinea and Japan are commemorating five decades of strong bilateral ties through Japan’s Official Development Assistance (ODA), a partnership that has driven nationwide progress in infrastructure, health, education, and grassroots development since 1974.
To mark the milestone, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) hosted a media conference in Port Moresby, highlighting the achievements of the past 50 years while outlining new strategies for continued cooperation.
Over this half-century, Japan’s ODA contributions to Papua New Guinea have totaled an estimated 6 billion Kina, delivered through grants, concessional loans, and technical cooperation programs managed by JICA and the Embassy of Japan.
Japan’s assistance has impacted a wide range of sectors. From providing medical equipment to enhancing access to water and education in remote communities, the partnership has prioritized both physical infrastructure and human development. Technical cooperation programs have also helped build local capacity in health, agriculture, ICT, and public infrastructure.
Between 2019 and 2023 alone, the Embassy of Japan implemented 40 development projects under three main schemes: the Economic and Social Development Program, collaboration with international organizations, and grassroots assistance.
Speaking at the conference, Japanese Ambassador to PNG, His Excellency Mochizuki Hisainobu, reaffirmed Japan’s commitment to expanding the partnership over the next 50 years. He emphasized Japan’s diplomatic and trade priorities with PNG, underscoring mutual interests in climate resilience, digital skills, and youth training.
“Development is a shared journey, with people and partnerships at its heart,” Ambassador Mochizuki stated, reflecting on the spirit of cooperation that has shaped decades of collaboration.
Today, Japan remains a top development partner in over 190 countries, with Papua New Guinea holding a strategic place in its Pacific engagements.
Looking ahead, both nations are committed to strengthening ties that not only deliver infrastructure and services but also empower communities and foster sustainable growth."
Mineral Resource Madang delivers ambulance to Bundi,30/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4663,"Mineral Resources Madang (MRM), a subsidiary of the Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC), has delivered a fully kitted ambulance to serve the people of Ward 22 in the Bundi district of Madang Province.
The ambulance, purchased with a combined K298,000 (K98,000 from MRDC and K200,000 from MRM), will be managed by the Madang Provincial Health Authority (PHA) and stationed at the Enekwai Health Centre. It is fully equipped with basic medical supplies and will serve approximately 7,000 people in the remote area.
MRM Director John Tigavu emphasized the critical impact of this contribution.

Tigavu highlighted the perilous journeys faced by residents, stating, ""Pregnant mothers walk from the Kumbukari mine site down to Ramu, cross the river to Usino. It takes about 8 to 9 hours to walk, and many have lost their lives on the road.""
The ambulance is registered under the Madang PHA.
""We are working on an agreement with the PHA to have the ambulance based at the Enekwai Health Centre and for the PHA to maintain the ambulance,” Tigavu added."
PNG Updates Earthquake Design Standards,30/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4662,"Papua New Guinea has taken a major step toward safer infrastructure with the conclusion of a high-level workshop aimed at reviewing and updating the country’s Earthquake Engineering
Design Standards for bridges. Held in Port Moresby, the workshop was led by the Department of Works and facilitated by international and local engineering experts.
Works Secretary Gibson Holemba delivered closing remarks, commending engineers, consultants, and development partners for their contributions. He described the updated design standards as more than just technical refinements—they represent a national commitment to safeguarding lives, protecting investments, and building a resilient future.
Papua New Guinea lies in a geologically active region and is highly susceptible to seismic events. The existing bridge infrastructure is increasingly vulnerable to earthquakes, prompting the urgent need for updated, scientifically grounded engineering practices.
The three-day workshop was facilitated by Geoscience Australia, Becca Consultants, and Kings Consultants, and supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the Australian High Commission (AHC). The gathering brought together engineers, technical specialists, researchers, and development stakeholders from across the country and abroad.
Key Outcomes:
The revised earthquake design standards are tailored to PNG’s unique seismic, terrain, and geotechnical conditions, ensuring greater durability and safety
The new standards align PNG’s engineering practices with global best practices, while maintaining relevance to local construction challenges.
These updates are intended to be institutionalized into national engineering codes, construction practices, and regulatory frameworks.
The workshop directly supports national goals under Vision 2050, the National Transport Strategy, and the Connect PNG Program.
“What we’ve achieved here goes beyond technical standards—this is about protecting lives, safeguarding our infrastructure, and ensuring our bridges withstand the shocks of tomorrow. It is both a professional obligation and a moral responsibility.”
Infrastructure plays a crucial role in connecting communities, enabling economic growth, and ensuring safety. With updated seismic design principles, Papua New Guinea is positioning itself to build stronger, safer, and longer-lasting bridges that can better withstand the unpredictable forces of nature.
These developments also reflect a growing emphasis on climate resilience and disaster preparedness in national infrastructure planning.
The Department of Works acknowledged the vital support of development partners, academic institutions, and international experts. The collaboration between Australian and Papua New Guinean engineers and agencies reflects a shared commitment to regional resilience and engineering excellence.
As the workshop concluded, Secretary Holemba called on all engineers and practitioners to carry the momentum forward by embedding the revised standards into daily practice. He said the real work begins now—turning policies into projects and standards into safeguards for every community that depends on PNG’s road and bridge networks.
The Department of Works will be working with stakeholders in the coming months to disseminate the new standards across provinces and incorporate them into training, regulation, and upcoming projects."
Yule Island gazette notice not sinister: Rosso,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4656,"Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Lands and Physical Planning and Urbanisation, John Rosso, said the Yule Island Gazette notice that was published earlier this year was not sinister and not declare ownership rights of the ancestral land.
A National Gazette notice of intention under Section 37 of the Land Commission Act was published on the 29th of January 2025 to declare Yule Island in Kairuku District, Central Province as National Land.
In the notice, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Lands and Physical Planning and Urbanization, John Rosso, said that it was his intention to declare not earliest than the expiration of three months following the date of the publication of notice in the National Gazette that the land specified in the schedule is;
a)	Government land
b)	Was acquitted before Independence Day by a pre-Independence Administration in PNG and
c)	Being required for public purpose as National Land.
The notice indicated that; All that piece of land containing an area of 670.8 hectares or thereabouts described as Deed of Attestation numbers 111.318 and 431 Milinch of Kairuku Fourmil of Yule Central Province locally known as Yule Island being whole of the land entered in the index of Deed of Attestation in the Department of Lands and Physical Planning. This is to provide a public record of planned actions, decisions, or policies, allowing for scrutiny and feedback.
Following the publication of this gazette, many expressed concerns, accusing the government of land grabbing from customary landowners. Minister Rosso in addressing the issue said that the notice was misunderstood.
“It’s been in the news and social media and like social media in PNG, they like to sensationalize and use it to their own benefits,” Rosso stated. “I have assured the governor specifically in the presence of the secretary that it was not the intention of the Department of Lands to acquire the whole of Yule Island and there is no title given to anyone else in Yule Island.”
“It is a process that Lands does to ensure that declaration of land to see where the church land is, where the government land is and etc.
“It is a process that we need to complete these files with and I have assured the Governor that once that process is complete the land where the Catholic church, or whatever is on which area of the land is identified, the rest is for the village and they utilize it to whatever they want to do with it.
“No one has the title for Yule Island, it is the process of declaration of National Interest, so we can see whoever interested parties are in there and sort out the technical aspects of it. We have advised the governor and we will keep her abreast of what is going on there.”
Central Provincial Member, Rufina Peter, spoke of the land acquisition on Yule Island during the swearing-in of the Central Provincial Physical Planning Board on the 23rd of May, 2025. Although she was satisfied with his clarification of the notice, she requested a proper response from the minister to the people of Yule Island."

K20m investment to improve ease of doing business,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4652,"The opportunities for business and investment are bright in the next few years but Papua New Guinea (PNG) needs to improve the ease of doing business and not continue to use old manual systems of facilitating trade processes.
Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru says, “According to the latest World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index, PNG is ranked 120 out of the 190 economies in 2023. The low ranking signifies and attests the stark reality of the inefficient and ineffective trade processes and system of PNG resulting in high cost of trade.”
He added, “The anticipated growth in the economy from trade and investment has not been realized owing to dysfunctional trade processes and systems that are fraught with delays and increased cost of trade as traders contend with the challenges of meeting multiple regulatory requirements from multiple locations. The Marape Government wants to improve our business process to compete with the rest of the world using technology rather than our manual systems.”
The government is working to change its outdated systems.
“We have decided this year that we will commence the acquisition process to acquire an electronic Single Window System. Our government will invest K20 million to acquire and implement this system to increase efficiency and to make us competitive. Work starts this year and PNG Customs Services will be the lead agency,” said Minister Maru.
The electronic Single Window System is a trade facilitation concept which allows an international (cross border) trader to submit required trade information to a single agency using a web-based digital automated portal, rather than having to deal with multiple agencies in multiple locations to obtain necessary papers, permits, and clearance to complete import or export processes, resulting in reduced cost of trade. The pursuit of the concept of electronic Single Window System is to promote a seamless flow of trade, through the automation of trade processes using an electronic online platform for processing Customs declarations, obtaining permits, licenses, and approvals through an electronic online platform.
“The key objective is to automate the trade processes and use an online platform to improve release times with a seamless flow of goods in trade. This will result in increased compliance, increased economic activities, enhanced economic growth through increased international trade, reduce the cost of doing business, improvement in the ease of doing business, increase revenue collections, and effective and collaborative border management,” explained Minister Maru.
“We need everyone to come on board and co-operate so we will have one system to facilitate trade. The Marape-Rosso Government is determined and as the Minister responsible for international trade and investment, I am determined, and I need the support of everyone, including all Government Agencies and the private sector,” said Minister Maru"
IRC uncovers disturbing pattern to evade tax,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4651,"The Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) has uncovered a disturbing pattern among certain companies in Papua New Guinea: the deliberate inflation of Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) to understate profits and evade taxes. This deceptive practice not only distorts commercial reality but also undermines the fairness of the tax system and disadvantages honest businesses.
COGS inflation typically involves overstating the cost of acquiring or producing goods—through fictitious purchases, inflated supplier invoices, or misclassified personal expenses—to reduce declared profits and, ultimately, lower tax payable. In effect, some entities are masking real sales figures behind manipulated expenses.
This is tax evasion, and IRC states it will not be tolerated.
To address this growing concern, the IRC has initiated a targeted compliance campaign, anchored by a comprehensive COGS Benchmarking Project. The project aims to establish industry-specific benchmarks—such as typical COGS-to-sales ratios— for sectors including wholesale, retail, hospitality, and construction. These benchmarks serve as a diagnostic tool to identify companies whose reported figures fall outside normal industry ranges.
In tandem with the benchmarking initiative, the IRC has also begun requesting detailed COGS breakdowns and supporting documents from selected businesses. However, many responses have been evasive or incomplete, with companies citing the absence of proper accounting records—an alarming breach of legal obligations.
This conduct is in direct contravention of the following provisions under the Income Tax Act 1959:
•	Section 364(2): Businesses must maintain sufficient income and expenditure records in English, within Papua New Guinea, for at least seven years.
•	Section 365: Failure to maintain such records may amount to obstructing access to essential documents.
•	Section 320: Knowingly understating income or misrepresenting facts in tax returns is a criminal offence.
The IRC warns that:
•	Claims based on inflated COGS will be disallowed.
•	Offenders will be subjected to penalties, including criminal prosecution where applicable.
•	Persistent non-compliance will result in escalated enforcement actions, including risk-based audits and public disclosure where appropriate.
Commissioner General Sam Koim urges all businesses to uphold transparency and integrity in their financial reporting.
“We are now building an evidence-based tax administration, and data does not lie,” he stated.
“Our benchmarking and analytics systems are already flagging anomalies, and we will follow every lead.”
He added, “We have started to pluck revenue leakages, and this is one such risk area that has been identified, hence this intervention.”
IRC states that it remains firmly committed to protecting government revenue, ensuring fair competition, and rewarding businesses that play by the rules."
Government Keen to Create Attractive Business Environment,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4650,"Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru says the National Government is committed to creating a more attractive business environment by investing in in ease-of-doing-business interventions.
Minister Maru made this statement during his keynote address to members of the Government Agencies and the private sector who gathered in Lae, Morobe Province, for the 8th Customs Business Consultative Forum under the theme, “Customs Delivering on its Commitment to Efficiency, Security and Prosperity,” hosted by the PNG Customs Service.
Minister Maru acknowledged that PNG is not an attractive place to do business right now compared to other countries.
“I want to thank all our Government Agencies and our private sector for hanging in there despite all the challenges that we are facing as a country including highest unemployment, highest law-and-order problems, serious foreign currency issues, national debt of over K60 billion, and depreciating Kina value which have made it very difficult especially for our private sector. Our biggest problem in the last 50 years has been this: We have failed to build a strong and robust economy like other countries. After 50 years, PNG’s GDP sits at about US$ 30 billion.”
But not all is doom and gloom. Minister Maru stated, “Because we have seven new resource projects coming up including Papua LNG, Pasca Gas, P’nyang Gas Project, Wafi-Golpu Mine, Frieda Mine, Wildebeest and Namabarope. These resource projects will underpin the economy going forward. To create the 1 million jobs as stipulated in our Medium-Term Development Plan 4, we must change our policies, we must downstream process all our resources, we must compete with the rest of the world to bring in foreign direct investments, and the best way to do it is to develop Special Economic Zones (SEZs) as the main driver of future economy growth. SEZs will be very critical.”
Minister Maru added, “Our over reliance on the mining and petroleum sector has been our biggest mistake since Independence. While we have seven resource projects in the pipeline for the next ten years, this sector will not be our future. Our future will be downstream processing of all our logs and fisheries resources, manufacturing of all our raw materials in country, and replacing imports like rice. This is the future.”
Minister Maru also informed the participants on the review of tariffs and the need to protect the manufacturing sector, and the need to bring in a new anti-dumping legislation to protect the industries from dumping of products from other countries.
“The Government remains committed to fostering a sustainable and diversified economy by reducing dependence on foreign aid, strengthening trade partnerships to create a more competitive business environment, and making PNG an attractive destination for global investors. We are looking at building new trade and investment partnership with Indonesia, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates, and also deepen and strengthen our trade and investment relationship with China and Japan on the back of a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement,” said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru extended an invitation to all participants at the forum to attend the upcoming launch of the PNG SEZ Foundation Policy on June 16, 2025, and the 2nd PNG SEZ Summit that will be hosted at the Hilton Hotel in Port Moresby from August 31 – September 3, 2025."
PNG facing child well-being crisis,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4649,"“Just be very careful, child protection and well-being is not a checklist. You have to act.”
The UN Secretary General’s Special Representative on Violence Against Children, Dr Najat Maalla M’jid, issued this stern warning yesterday during a presentation to the newly established Permanent Parliamentry Committee on Youth and Children on Wednesday, 28 May 2025.
Dr Najat Maalla M’jid’s comments come at the back of alarming statistics, delivered by Danielle Winfrey, Manager of Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment (GEWE) with the National Capital District Commission (NCDC) at this meeting.
She highlighted that the future of Papua New Guinea (PNG) was at stake with alarming child well-being indicators - 47% immunization coverage, 44% child malnutrition, only 13% of births registered, child marriage that see children below the age of 18 marry, 45% access to basic water services and access to basic sanitation at 20% in urban areas, and 15% rural households.
Winfrey also highlighted that 5,310 cases of gender-based violence have been reported in the National Capital District (NCD) since 2017. Of these cases, 696 were cases involving children. The vile acts committed against these children include sexual penetration, sexual assault, sorcery accusation, forced marriage, denial of resources, and trafficking among others. These numbers are for NCD alone, as there is no national data base on child protection.
The government was challenged by Dr Najat Maalla M’jid, the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative on Violence Against Children to invest in Papua New Guinea’s children. According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), three-quarters of PNG children are experiencing some form of violence.
“Today you established this parliamentary committee, that its really important to promote, to monitor, to remind all the policy makers who made commitment that they had to deliver and they have to be accountable.
“I am seeing many things that are not going very well. Just be very careful, child protection and well-being is not a checklist. You have to act.”
During her short visit, Dr Najat met with Prime Minister James Marape, governors, senior ministers, parliamentarians, civil society groups, youth representatives, and members of the justice sector.
The committee was also briefed that the government is taking steps to address the injustices faced by children nationwide but progress is slow.
Minister for Community Development, Youth and Religion Jason Peter said, “We look forward to work with the development partners and other ministerial agencies and we believe that we all can work to together to put our children first in the country.”
Dr Najat says a lot is being done, “But just connect the dot. This is very important, there are many overlapping, you have to really build this chain of services in a concrete way. What type of services are needed, and how people are going to access it.”
Speaking on the newly established committee Dr Najat said, “It’s also about seeing child protection and well being as an investment. Its not additional expenses. Regarding just violence against children, direct and indirect costs is estimated to 11% of national GDP and in some countries its six times higher than the budget allocated to health.”
The establishment of the Permanent Parliamentary Committee on Youth and Children is expected to be a game-changer. The Committee is expected to provide oversight and accountability, coordination and integrity for child-focused policies and budgets, and monitor the Lukautim Pikinini Act, and drive cross-sectoral solutions.
Prime Minister James Marape in his address challenged those responsible for the well-being of children, especially parents to look after their children.
“To our fathers, look after your children, to our councillors, look after your children, to all members look after your children, to our governors look after your children and to myself, under my watch, I commit to look after children of our country,” said Prime Minister Marape.
The consequence of not taking any action will see PNG not achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for children including the aim to leaving no child behind: economic, social, and health costs will escalate; and the loss of potential leaving millions of children unable to contribute to PNG’s growth."
Business man donates to SUDA,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4647,"Prominent businessman Mathew Minape has donated K10,000 to the Sambe Unity Development Association (SUDA) in Lagaip, Enga Province, to support their water supply and other projects.
The water supply project aims to provide clean and reliable water to local residents, addressing a crucial need in the community.
Minape expressed his hope that this donation will aid in the successful implementation of the project and ultimately benefit the people of Porgera.
“Since I am from that area, it is only fitting for me to give back to my people,” Minape said.
Minape also urged the people to take ownership of the project and abstain from tribal fights and other unlawful activities.
Community leaders praised the contribution as an important step toward sustainable development in the area."
New Classroom Transforms Island Education,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4646,"Over 180 children from Pirtop and four nearby villages on Duke of York Island now have closer access to education following the official opening of a new four-in-one classroom at Pirtop Elementary and Primary School.
The milestone project, inaugurated on April 21, was made possible through the combined efforts of Pamili Ministry Inc. and the Puma Energy Foundation. It marks a significant step forward for remote education infrastructure in East New Britain Province.
“This facility is a game-changer for children in the area,” said Licks Ramani, Technical Officer at Pamili Ministry Inc. “It’s more than a building—it’s a chance for a brighter future.”
The initiative stemmed from a grassroots effort launched in August 2024 by four staff members from Puma Energy’s Port Moresby office. Forming an internal Charity Committee, the team proposed and executed the construction as their first project under the Foundation’s support, targeting education access for disadvantaged communities.
Despite challenges such as maritime transportation and sourcing construction materials from New Ireland Province, the classroom was successfully delivered and handed over in April 2025. The project underscores the importance of partnership between corporate sponsors, faith-based organizations, and local communities.
Both Pamili Ministry Inc. and the Puma Energy Foundation have acknowledged the support of the Duke of York Local Level Government, local suppliers, and youth volunteers, whose contributions were vital to completing the classroom.
For many children on the island, the new facility brings formal education within reach—an empowering development for families long affected by limited infrastructure."
Over 840 graduate from FODE in Fly,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4644,"More than 840 students across the Fly River region in Western Province have graduated or advanced through the Flexible Open Distance Education (FODE) program—marking one of the largest FODE graduation cohorts ever seen in Papua New Guinea’s most sparsely populated province.
The milestone achievement was made possible through a transformative education initiative funded by the PNG Sustainable Development Program (SDP) and delivered by the Kokoda Track Foundation (KTF), in close partnership with the Western Province Division of Education. The program offers second-chance education opportunities to those who were unable to complete or continue formal schooling, particularly in rural and hard-to-reach areas.
The celebrations held across the province were attended by senior representatives from PNG SDP, KTF, and the Western Provincial Government, including Western Provincial Education Advisor Charlie Buia, SDP Director of Education Dr. Brad Shaw, KTF CEO Dr. Genevieve Nelson, and KTF Head of Education Martha Bentley.
Among the standout graduates is Marilyn Duwaba, a primary school teacher and single mother of three from Kiunga. After completing Grade 12 more than 25 years ago with a GPA below the minimum teaching requirement, Marilyn turned to FODE for a second chance.
Despite her demanding schedule as a full-time teacher and mother, Marilyn committed to the flexible learning model and successfully upgraded her results. In 2024, she not only met the minimum government requirements for teaching but was named Dux of her graduating class.
“I was so excited that my effort had paid off,” Marilyn shared. “With this kind of opportunity in the community, we don't have to stay at the same level. We can continue to advance ourselves, provide better for our families, and contribute to our communities.”
She hopes her story will encourage others to take the leap, despite challenges or past setbacks. “You don't stop because it doesn’t turn out right the first time. If you want to achieve something, keep going. Education doesn’t end at a certain grade.”
This FODE program is part of PNG SDP’s Gutpela Community Strategy 2025–2030, which aims to empower Western Province communities through inclusive and sustainable development. The education arm of the strategy supports long-term partnerships between SDP, KTF, the national FODE system, and the provincial government to provide flexible learning pathways.
Dr. Nelson described the graduation ceremonies as “a powerful reminder of what’s possible when strategic partnerships work in harmony to serve communities.”
With thousands of students now engaged through FODE across the province, the program is creating a pipeline of empowered individuals—many of whom will pursue further education or employment, helping to drive long-term development in Western Province."
Relief efforts for drought-affected communities,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4642,"The International Organization for Migration (IOM), in collaboration with the National Disaster Centre and the Bougainville Department of Community Government and District Affairs, has worked through the Bougainville Directorate of Disaster and Emergency to successfully deliver essential relief supplies to remote communities on Nissan Island and the surrounding atolls in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.
Due to the generous funding support from the U.S. Government, this has enabled the prepositioning of relief supplies, a total of 200 Non-Food Item kits including jerry cans, soap, and kitchen utensils were distributed across the islands of Nissan, Pinapel, Fead, Carterets (Han, Piul, Iolosa, Iasela, Iagain), Mortlock, and Tasman. These islands are particularly vulnerable to drought and climate-related disasters.
The distribution focused on reaching the most at-risk households, including those headed by women, persons with disabilities, and the elderly. Approximately 1,000 individuals are expected to benefit from the assistance, which is aimed at enhancing household resilience in the face of environmental challenges.
Felsiha Tsiau, Manager of the Carterets Community Government, expressed appreciation for the support:
“These jerry cans will greatly assist families in Iolosa and Iasela, who often have to travel long distances to fetch water during the dry season.”
Quentin Talingapua, Coordinator of the Bougainville Directorate of Disaster and Emergency, highlighted the importance of the collaborative approach:
“We deeply value our partnership with IOM, especially their technical support in conducting needs assessments and ensuring an effective emergency response.”
As part of the broader response, IOM, supported by U.S. Government funding, provided technical assistance, logistics, and critical relief materials. IOM also deployed staff to Nissan Island and the surrounding atolls to support the Autonomous Bougainville Government’s field operations. Additionally, ongoing climate adaptation assessments are being carried out to identify key vulnerabilities and inform future strategies to strengthen community resilience to climate-related impacts."

Court dismisses Nomane’s application,28/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4636,"The Supreme Court has dismissed Deputy Opposition leader James Nomane’s application seeking the court's interpretation of parliament’s recent decision to amend section 145 of the constitution regarding the motion of no confidence.
Nomane’s application was filed on April 17th by lawyer Paul Mawa. The substantive matter was heard on Monday, and the decision was handed down today.
The orders sought in the substantive application were;
•	The applicant (Nomane) seeks ad hoc directions pursuant to Section 185 of the Constitution and Order 11 Rule 9 of the Supreme Court Rules for the application to be deemed as appropriate for the purpose of making an application under Order 11 Rule 32 (1) of the rules, and
•	Pursuant to Order 11 Rule 32 (1) of the Rules and Section 155 (4) of the Constitution, an ancillary order be made to clarify the decision and orders of the Supreme Court of 31 March, 2025 that the Constitutional Amendment No 48 (Motions of No Confidence) Law 2025 has no application whatsoever to the Motion of No Confidence in the Prime Minister dated 27 November, 2024 dealt with by Parliament on April 15th, 2025.
However, the application was dismissed on the basis that the application is an abuse of process under Order 13, Rule 16 (1) (a) of the Supreme Court Rules.
Order 13, Rule 16(1)(a) is a legal provision that deals with evidence in civil proceedings. Specifically, it allows a court to take evidence immediately if a witness is about to leave the jurisdiction or there is another sufficient cause to warrant immediate examination. This provision is designed to ensure that evidence is preserved and can be presented to the court in a timely manner, particularly when a witness is not readily available for later examination.
The court ruled that there are many ways by which the issues that the applicant wants clarification on can properly be brought before the Supreme Court. Making a post-judgment application to get the Court to clarify the effect of its final decision, is not one of them. Hence, the court determines that the application is an abuse of process."

With Papua New Guinea’s 50th Anniversary of Independence approaching in September, these uniforms will allow the PNGDF to proudly represent your nation during this historic celebration,” said Major General Jay Bargeron, who traveled from U.S. Indo-Pacific Command to present the uniforms.
“Through those 50 years and for the 50 years plus to come, PNGDF and the United States Department of Defense have been and will remain side-by-side. Admiral Paparo looks forward to attending your celebrations and seeing PNGDF proudly don these new uniforms.”
While these uniforms bear the colors of Papua New Guinea, they are also a reflection of values the United States and Papua New Guinea share: those of service, honor, and the responsibility that comes with wearing a military uniform.
Rear Admiral Philip Polewara, Commander of the PNGDF, acknowledged the uniforms’ role in boosting morale, reinforcing discipline, and enhancing public trust. Across the PNGDF, the donation includes 15,000 complete uniforms, with 3 uniforms per service member.

Since 2023, the United States has been delivering on our promises by providing training courses, engaging in bilateral exercises, and increasing engagement with the PNGDF.

During a police operation on illegal activities by some vendors in Waigani, a weapon was discharged, and a young woman from Southern Highlands Province was struck with a bullet and died.
In a statement released today, Police Commissioner David Manning said the three police personnel are under a criminal investigation to determine who fired that fatal shot, and the circumstances surrounding the discharge of a firearm.
“I call on all members of the community to remain calm while this matter is investigated,"" Commissioner Manning said.
""As Commissioner, and speaking on behalf of all capable and dedicated police, I expect better and a more restrained use of force from our personnel.
""The public can rest assured that this is not only an internal investigation, but also a criminal investigation.
""The fact of this matter is that a young woman is dead from a gunshot wound.
""From the briefing provided to me, it appears the police officer who discharged the weapon had not intended to shoot this young lady, but that is not the point. A woman is  dead because a gun was fired.""
Following the incident, Commissioner Manning instructed a review of police procedures and the use of warning shots.
""The RPNGC is already introducing 'less-than-lethal' measures to control potentially violent situations, including CS gas and beanbag rounds.
""Just because a police man or woman has a loaded gun does not give them the right to  shoot, as certain conditions must apply at law. There must be an imminent threat to the lives of civilians or security personnel for a firearm to be discharged.
""There will be clearer rules of engagement in confronting threats, with the escalation of force to deal with threats clearly articulated.
""That being said, these changes will not bring back the life of the young lady who has tragically died in this incident.
""On behalf of the RPNGC I offer my most sincere condolences to her family,and a commitment to ensure this matter is fully investigated and ensure justice is served."""

North Fly Acting Provincial Police Commander (PPC), Inspector Anjap Minata, said .
Police were searching for the suspect, Koim, who is alleged to be involved in a sexual penetration case involving a minor. During that search, police discovered that the suspect had marijuana.
He said the suspects were standing with the boxes of marijuana when police approached them.  They took both suspects to the police station and opened the cargo boxes, and discovered nicely wrapped dried marijuana. The suspects admitted to the police that the boxes belonged to them.
Minata confirmed that the two drug boxes weighed about 18 kilograms and were worth K90,000 to K100,000 on the street market.
He said the drugs were nicely wrapped with a black wrapper and sent through the Mail Express via Port Moresby from Mt Hagen to Kiunga. He said by the look of it, it was a professionally designed and organized business run by the suspects.
PPC Minata said the suspect, Koim was arrested and charged in 2018 for the same offence. He was imprisoned for two years, but never learned his lesson.
“It is a fast-making money business, and everyone is involved in these illegal activities, but the law will still catch up with you one fine day.

NStJA concerned over misuse of uniform,26/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4602,"The National St John Ambulance Council (NStJA) is aware of a video circulating on social media showing a man in his 20s wearing a T-shirt bearing National St John branding with a PNG flag on the right breast pocket, and engaging in alleged inappropriate conduct in a public store.
NStJA clarified that the individual shown in the video is not and has never been a member of the PNG National St John Ambulance. The actions portrayed do not reflect the values, behaviour, or standards expected of our organisation or personnel.
It is an offence under Section 13 of the National St John Council Incorporation Act 1976 for any person to wear or use a St John uniform, emblem, badge, or any identifying mark in a way that suggests they are connected to the National St John Ambulance unless they have written permission from the Council.
The law exists to protect the reputation and trust associated with the St John uniform, similar to the legal protections in place for the uniforms of the Police, Fire, and Defence forces.
“The St John uniform is associated with trust and integrity. People welcome St John staff into their homes and businesses at their most vulnerable time. We must protect the uniform, just as it is protected by law for police, fire and defence personnel,” said Dr Mangu Kendino, Chief Doctor, National St John Ambulance.
The public must be able to trust that a person wearing a St John uniform is a trained, authorised, and accountable member of the service.

PNG’s Remote Areas Remain Lawless and Unprotected,24/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4588,"Professor Bryce Barker of the University of Southern Queensland, who was held captive by criminals in the Bosavi area in 2023, says the recent kidnapping of people along the border of Western and Hela/SHP provinces shows that little to nothing has been done to secure these remote places from thugs and criminals who wonder there at will and terrorise the lives of unsuspecting locals.
Professor Bryce was on a research trip to the Bosavi area in 2023, when he and five other people were kidnapped by criminals, allegedly from Hela Province and held captive in exchange for a ransom.
Professor Bryce and two females, who were the last of the captives to be released were safely rescued on 26 February, 2023 after the government paid some money to the captors.
The Prime Minister, James Marape met the released hostages at the airport back then and told the media that the amount of money paid was less that what the captors had demanded.
""They were released nothing close to a K3.5 million kina as demanded or requested was paid. We've reached a critical stage in the operation where we could not delay any more, they had to come out alive. Engagement was possible, security and lives of the three were at risk, first things first we had to secure them out alive,"" Marape told the media on February 12, 2023.
This was the first recorded case of kidnapping along this area and two years on, another eight people have been captured two weeks ago.
In this latest turn of events, the Police Commissioner confirmed in a statement this week that two criminals were arrested and are now in police custody while the identities of others are known.
Professor Bryce told TVWAN Online that, “while I understand the complex issues that the PNG authorities and the police have to deal with in coming to grips with these issues of lawlessness in these remote parts of PNG – however until there is a concerted effort to control these criminal gangs situations like this will continue. “
“The successful extraction of my team from this situation shows that given the right impetus and resources these gangs can be found and dealt with.”"

Dr Najat Maalla M’jid, the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence Against Children, will arrive in Port Moresby on Sunday 25 May for a five-day mission.
This is her first official visit to PNG, and it comes as the country steps up its role as a Pathfinder under the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children (EVAC), which it joined in 2021.
In November last year, PNG participated in the Global Conference on EVAC in Bogotá, Colombia, where it presented its national pledge outlining key commitments to child protection reform.

“Violence against children is widespread, devastating, and preventable,” Dr Mendonca said.
“No child should have to grow up in fear,” she said.
Dr Mendonca said the mission was expected to help mobilise support for EVAC implementation, increase investment in child protection services and the social service workforce, expand positive parenting programs, and improve coordination across sectors.

Road restores life for remote villages,23/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4573,"After nearly a decade of isolation, five remote villages in West Sepik Province are reconnected to the outside world—thanks to the EU-STREIT PNG Programme for the construction of a 16.7 km road.
For over 10 years, more than 12,000 residents endured risky sea travel to reach Vanimo, the provincial capital. Now, with the newly restored road linking Rawo to Leitre and neighboring villages, the journey has become safer, cheaper, and faster.
“This road is a very big plus for the rural community,” said Father Joseph Runnai from Leitre’s Catholic Mission. “Before, travelling by sea was expensive and dangerous.”
Since June 2024, the International Labour Organization (ILO) under the EU-STREIT PNG Programme constructed 22 culverts, two bridges, and climate-resilient infrastructure to ensure year-round access.
The impact has been immediate—transport costs have dropped from PGK 100 to PGK 20 per cocoa delivery, rekindling interest in cocoa farming and increasing local cash flow.
At the heart of this revival is the Saint Mary’s Cocoa Growers Group, which produce 467 kg of dried beans in a month, earning over PGK 6,400. Youths are distributing pest-tolerant seedlings, women are selling more produce in markets, and previously unreachable vanilla and fish farmers are gaining access to buyers.
Even mobility has improved, with motorcycles now common in Leitre. For young mother Raynatalyn Simewa, who has a hearing impairment, the road brought her first job and dignity. She now earns PGK 700 a month doing road maintenance.
Backed by the European Union’s Global Gateway Strategy, the road exemplifies how sustainable infrastructure can reshape rural lives—creating jobs, empowering women, and opening global market access.
“All we wanted was a road,” said farmer Penuel Amele. “And now we can take off from here.”"

“We have spent millions of kina in transport costs alone, which could have been saved for classrooms, teachers' houses, health services and other needs,” Kamdaru added.
The Middle Ramu’s National Census conducted in 2023 has recorded its population density to be over 116,600. The DDA is updating data for rice and coffee farmers and mothers in each local level government area.
“We travel long distances just to mill our rice and coffee and after paying our transport and machine costs, we are left with minimal revenue that does not reflect the hard work put into production and sales of our cash crops,” Kamdaru added.
Meanwhile, the missing road link between Madang and Mul-Baiyer is under construction, which can alleviate transport issues for the people of Middle Ramu."
Hearing on concerns surrounding elections,22/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4563,"Illegal firearms and ammunition, timely access to operational funds and coordination concerns regarding intelligence sharing between the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) and the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) were highlighted during a public hearing conducted by the Special Parliamentary Committee on the 2022 General Elections, today.
The one-day public hearing held at the Parliament’s State Function Room was conducted to follow up on key recommendations from its report on the RPNGC, PNGDF and the PNG Electoral Commission. This is in preparation for the upcoming by-elections and the Local Level Government (LLG) elections, and more significantly, the 2027 National General Elections.
Conducted by Chairman Allan Bird, Deputy Chairman Sir Puka Temu and Committee Member Keith Iduhu, questions were posed to representatives from the PNGDF, Department of Defence and RPNGC.
The committee sought to establish how much of the recommendations from the Committee’s Interim Report on the 2022 General Elections were being embraced by each organization to improve their preparedness in upcoming elections.
Chief of PNGDF, Rear Admiral Philip Polewara says the PNGDF is preparing for worst case scenarios.
In regards to questions surrounding the sharing of intelligence, Polewara said, “On the ground, yes, there is regular daily exchange of information between the two forces because we support the police. But at this level, between me and the commissioner, we talk about the operations. But the nitty-gritties of it, we haven’t discussed since my time in the office.”
In response to questions on illegal firearms and ammunition circulation in the Highlands region, RPNGC Chief of Staff Kyle Saltmarsh said he believes the use of firearms is best tackled by two mechanism; the first is by cutting off the source of funding that enables the purchase of ammunition, the transfer of elicit firearms; and more effective collaboration and more effective targeting.
Furthermore, in responding to questions posed surrounding timely availability of essential operational funds, Defence Secretary John Akipe said the department is preparing to submit their budget that includes election preparation costs this year for the 2026 budget. Chairman Bird and Deputy Chair Sir Puka says this may be too late and the budget should have been submitted last year for release this year.
Emphasizing the significance of the hearing, Chairman Bird emphasized the importance of managing public perception.
“I’m very aware and sensitive to public perception and one of the things I think this Committee should get from all of you is to (is) a lot of these concerns will have been dealt with so the public will have confidence.”
Meanwhile, Deputy Chairman Sir Puka impressed on the PNGDF and the RPNGC develop a ‘security strategy for 2027.’ He further stated that the PNGEC needs to also, develop a 2027 election plan so key stakeholders like security partners can be able to plan around these key dates and activities endorsed by the commission."
"Two kidnappers arrested, identities of others known",22/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4562,"Police working to free the hostages in Western province have made a breakthrough with the arrest of two criminals who are now in police custody.
Police Commissioner David Manning also announced that the identities of the other offenders and their associates are known following analysis of intelligence and communications by police.
This is after almost two weeks since the kidnapping occurred in Western Province, near the border of Hela and Southern Highlands Provinces.

Police Commissioner David Manning said police operations are ongoing to end the ordeal and further information will only be released when it is available, keeping in mind the sensitivities of the ongoing operation.
Police are now prioritising the safety of those held hostage, alongside restricting the movement of kidnappers.
While police are exercising patience, Manning in the statement stated that his men will not hesitate to intervene swiftly with suitable tactical operations in line with operational planning.
He said that is the course of action expected by the people of Papua New Guinea, and these are the directions given to police dealing with the situation.
Manning also highlighted the challenges police are faced with in carrying out operations in rural areas.
“Police continue to face serious challenges due to limited aviation support in this region. Ready access to appropriate aviation assets, including helicopters, is essential to the delivery of policing services to our remote communities.
“Police continue to work with Government and private industry partners to identify sustainable solutions to aviation requirements that meet the current and forecast operational requirements of the RPNGC.”
He also made a call to third parties to stay out of this situation and let police do their job to free the hostages in a lawful matter.
“We are aware of some intelligence which indicates efforts by political elements to attempt ransom negotiation with the kidnappers.  I reiterate that such conduct will not be tolerated and risks the effectiveness of ongoing police operations,” he concluded."

Japan tells PNG to sort trade issues,21/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4544,"As Papua New Guinea’s second largest trading partner, Japan is calling on the PNG Government to address significant lingering trade issues that hinder Japanese business, investment, and tourism in PNG.
The Director for Pacific Islands Centre in Japan, Ryuzo Saito, raised this in his meeting this morning with the Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, and the delegation in Tokyo, Japan.
Saito said Japanese businesses and tourists were keen to visit, to do business and invest in PNG, however, PNG has let itself down by not sorting out trade issues that have been talked about for a long time.
The four critical issues that Saito raised were:
1.Visa on Arrival for Japanese standard passport holders. This arrangement existed prior to COVID. However, since COVID, the arrangement was temporarily halted and is yet to be lifted by PNG immigration and Citizenship Authority.
2.The need for Air Niugini to resume direct flights from Port Moresby to Narita, Tokyo, for ease of connectivity.
3.Remittance of foreign currency. The foreign exchange and regulations by the Bank of Papua New Guinea is not giving priority to the repatriation of dividends that delay the remittance of profits back to Japan.
4.Security (law-and-order issues).
Minister Maru, in response, thanked Saito for his frankness in relaying the concerns of the Japanese businesses and tourists.
""As the Minister for International Trade and Investment, I support this call. If we want to increase two-way trade with Japan, we need to sort out these issues immediately, which have been lingering for a long time. We need to get our act together,"" said Minister Maru.
""I will raise all these issues with the Government to have them resolved so we can see more trade and tourism inflows into PNG from Japan. I am working with the Prime Minister, James Marape, to get Air Niugini to resume flights to Narita this year.""
Minister Maru emphasized the significance of Japan’s relationship with PNG.
“Japan is PNG’s second largest trading partner and an important development partner. I want to thank the Japanese Government and people for their continuous assistance towards PNG’s development aspirations,” said Minister Maru."
Upset vendors call for answers,21/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4543,"Vendors at Waigani Market in the nation’s capital are seeking answers from the National Capital District Commission following the loss of their market goods through fire on Sunday night.
They want NCDC to explain the delay in the redevelopment of the Waigani market.
In 2023, the Waigani market was closed after NCDC announced the redevelopment, forcing market vendors to operate in the open space under temporary shelters.
They believe their market goods would not have been burned if they were still using the old market. Vendors confirmed that toilets were built; however, a two-year delay in constructing the main market.
Since then, vendors have been using the open space beside the Waigani police station and Kone Tigers oval.
“NCDC told us to go home for three months, and we listened. We felt that life got hard. We started to market outside with the agreement with the boys living here and the Police. We have been here for two years and six months. We want to return to the main market,” said Margareth, a market vendor.
Another vendor, Joyce said; “All our cargo bags with fresh goods like banana, kaukau, cabbage, carrot, onion, and kumu bags, the money that was spent on them, worth K2000 to K3000 and some we got the bags on credit have all been lost.”
Currently, police investigations are underway.
Meanwhile, Governor Parkop, in sympathizing with the vendors of Waigani Market, said NCDC will not make its position known until a police report is received after investigations.
He said that at this stage, NCDC will not accept liability for this act as it was not related to the delay in the rehabilitation and expansion of the existing Waigani market.
Parkop said this problem was caused by criminals and not NCDC."
Waigani incident under investigation,21/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4542,"Police in NCD and Central province are hard at work to ensure the murder and arson incident at Waigani in the early hours of Monday does not escalate to other parts of the city and Central province.
The NCD/Central Commander, acting Assistant Commissioner of Police, Benjamin Turi confirmed that police officers from NCD and Central have been tasked to monitor the command and ensure that nothing like this happens again.
He said investigators are doing their job to first identify the deceased, obtain statements from possible eyewitnesses, and create a file that will guide them in further investigations.
Turi said the report is sketchy because the Engans and the Goilala's who are involved, are yet to come forward to provide statements on what happened that led to the death and destruction of the market.
He said there are many social media posts on the incident, which are misleading, and the police are working to verify facts and provide proper updates to the public.
Turi said Central police are patrolling their areas of operation. He confirmed that there are no roadblocks along the Hiritano Highway, contrary to social media posts. While in the city, police units are monitoring possible locations where they think either group may meet to cause trouble related to the Waigani incident.
Turi said it is an unfortunate situation that has caused many people to suffer, as vendors have lost their food to sell inside the market, and the people who buy from Waigani market now have to travel to other locations to do their marketing.
“I want to assure the public that the situation at Waigani is under control, and my police officers, along with other support units, are hard at work to ensure the city is safe. My call now to the city residents is to respect each other. Port Moresby City is Papua New Guinea, and it is not a village where people move around in ethnic groups to harm others and cause trouble in the city. Many people are moving into the city every day, making policing a challenge for us daily,” Turi said.
He added that the number of unemployed people in the city has increased, which has led to criminal activities. He said police have limited powers to control the movement of these people coming into the city.
“I do not want my police officers to correct these unemployed people and get blamed for correcting them, because most of them do not know the basic laws on how to respect others who are living in the city.”
“Awareness after awareness is made, but people do not listen; that is why we see people losing their lives and properties. The incident that started at Waigani involved unemployed people asking a security guard for money, and when they received a negative response, they attacked him, which led to the destruction of properties and lives lost,” Turi said.
He commended police officers for their efforts to quickly respond, carry out investigation, and make their presence known in their command."
Nationwide rollout of zero-rating by June 1st,21/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4541,"The Internal Revenue Commission (IRC), the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC), and the PNG Customs Service will jointly enforce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Zero-Rating Policy on 13 essential household items nationwide, effective June 1st, 2025, to June 30th, 2026.
This policy initiative is part of the Government's economic relief measures aimed at addressing the rising cost of living for Papua New Guinean families.
The Zero-Rating measure will ensure that no GST is charged on the sale of the following essential items:
1.Baby Diapers
2.Tinned Fish
3.Cooking Oil
4.Biscuits
5.Flour (Wheat)
6.Chicken
7.Instant Noodles
8.Coffee
9.Tinned Meat
10.Rice
11.Sanitary Pads and Tampons
12.Soap (Bar only), and
13.Tea.
IRC, ICCC, and PNG Customs are working collaboratively to ensure full compliance and effective implementation of this policy. This includes:
•Retailer & Supplier Compliance: All registered businesses are legally required to remove GST from the listed goods. Pricing must be adjusted to reflect the tax exemption.
•Consumer Monitoring & Enforcement: A joint taskforce of the IRC, ICCC, and PNG Customs will monitor pricing behaviour, investigate complaints, and penalize non-compliant entities.
•Public Awareness Campaigns: Ongoing education and outreach initiatives schedule post implementation will inform consumers and businesses of their rights and obligations.
Any business or retailer found to:
•Continue charging GST on zero-rated items, or
•Retain pre-zero-rating prices without passing savings on to consumers, will face penalties under the GST Act 2003 and related legislation. These include fines between K1,000 to K50,000, loss of GST input credits, deregistration, and potential prosecution.
Businesses are further advised that:
•Only goods acquired or imported after 1 January 2025 and held in stock by 1 June 2025 qualify for zero-rating.
•Notwithstanding the above condition, Input tax credits will only be allowed where it can be proven that the benefits of zero-rating were passed on to the final consumer.
Furthermore, as outlined in the IRC's high-level report to the Government, this initiative is expected to reduce household expenses and support low-income earners by making essential goods more affordable.
While it is projected to reduce GST revenue by K210 to K300 million over the six-month period this year, the long-term socio-economic benefits in terms of inflation control and improved access to basic goods are substantial.
IRC, ICCC and Customs are collectively calling upon all businesses to act in good faith and uphold their social responsibility by implementing this policy transparently and fully. The success of this initiative depends on cooperation across all sectors of the supply chain, from importers and wholesalers to retailers.
“We urge consumers to be vigilant. If you notice any business failing to comply, you are encouraged to report the matter to the IRC, ICCC, or PNG Customs through the contact details below. Together, we can deliver real savings for our people.”"

PPCs call for review of Bail Act,21/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4536,"Provincial police commanders (PPCs) have called for a review of the Police Bail Act due to the increase in bench warrants delivered by the courts for execution annually.
The PPCs in a conference on Monday said they receive more than 50 bench warrants or court orders issued by the judge because defendants fail to appear in court after being granted bail.
Western Highlands Provincial Police Commander, Superintendent John Sagom, raised this issue during the one-day Prosecution Review Committee workshop for provincial commanders in Port Moresby. He stated that more than 400 bench warrants in his office need to be executed.
He said most of those who do not appear in court are those out on police bail and fail to appear in court.
PPC Sagom was supported by other PPCs, calling for a review of the Bail Act and amend the part that grant everyone the right to bail. They added that this right has allowed people to bail out and leave the area where they committed the crime, migrating to another location and making it difficult for the police to locate them and bring them to court.
The PPC’s also recommended that if a person is apprehended for any offense and wants to bail, they must obtain a guarantee letter from either their councilors or family leader and present it to the bail officer for the detainee to be released on bail.
Director of Prosecution, acting Superintendent Pare Kuiap, challenged the PPCs to work closely with all the prosecutors and investigators in their respective provinces to ensure they secure more convictions."

Financial literacy for schools achieved,20/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4526,"Financial Literacy Education (FLE) will soon be implemented in schools throughout the country after the conclusion of a two-week Financial Education Curriculum Validation workshop, culminating in the delivery of 40 fully aligned educational resources.
The Centre for Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI), in partnership with the Department of Education (DoE) through its Curriculum Development Division (CDD), successfully concluded the workshop. This marks an important step in the implementation of the Financial Education in Schools PNG (FESPNG) Project.
The workshop, held from May 15th–16th, also brought in an external partner from Aflatoun International and Cufa to review and align 13 syllabuses, 13 Teacher Resource Books, and 13 Student Activity Books.
This thorough process resulted in the development of eight strands, 16 units, 16 content standards, and benchmarks, reinforcing a consistent and inclusive approach to financial literacy education across all grade levels.
The workshop will support the integration of FLE into the country’s Standards-Based Curriculum from preparatory to Grade 12, and to validate the financial education curriculum materials developed through collaboration between the DoE-CDD, CEFI, Aflatoun International and Cufa.
The objectives of the workshop are to ensure that the financial education content aligns with CEFI’s Financial Literacy Standards and Conceptual Framework, maintaining national relevance and consistency. It also aimed to evaluate the developmental appropriateness of concepts across all grade levels, promoting coherent and age-appropriate progression.
Expert input was sought from financial literacy technical advisors to enhance the accuracy and contextual suitability of the content. Additionally, feedback from CEFI and external partners was gathered to confirm the curriculum’s relevance to real-life financial challenges. Finally, the workshop validated the templates of the Teacher Resource Books and Student Activity Books to ensure they are well-structured, accessible, and practical for classroom use.
Aflatoun Asia’s regional coordinator, Ya Ling Chao, who was present at the workshop, commended the country’s dedication to integrating financial education.
Chao described the initiative as “a historic milestone” and one of the most proactive collaborations she has encountered in the region.
On Friday, 16 May 2025, George Awap, Assistant Governor – Financial System Development and Innovation Group- Bank of Papua New Guinea, gave an impactful message at the end of the Financial Education Curriculum Alignment Workshop.
Awap thanked CEFI & DoE-CDD for their hard work during the two-week workshop. He praised their teamwork and also remembered past leaders who helped bring financial education to life.
“We are building on the hard work of those who came before us,” he said, naming former CEFI executive director Saliya Ranasinghe for his early efforts.
Awap’s key message was about Financial Education becoming a national focus.
“It should not only teach people how money works but also help them change their thinking and use this knowledge in real life.”
He said making a financial education curriculum is not easy. It must meet the needs of many different people and communities. There are challenges and these include reaching remote schools, finding enough money, and helping people, especially adults, change their way of thinking about money.
“It’s not just about lessons. It’s about changing habits.”
Awap explained that financial education is now a national priority and is part of the government’s wider plans. He encouraged Papua New Guineans to trust the financial system, and for students to use what they learn in real life.
“It’s about giving the students the right knowledge and knowledge that empowers them both inside and outside the classroom,” he said.
Steven Tandale, First Assistant Secretary at the DoE’s-CDD, praised the dedication and collaborative spirit of the workshop participants.
He emphaized the critical role that writing, research, and continuous improvement play in curriculum development and encouraged educators to view challenges as opportunities brought for innovation.
Tandale also acknowledged the practical barriers to implementation, such as logistics, printing, and delivery to remote schools, but affirmed that the team’s resourcefulness had led to creative solutions, including improved communication methods and enhanced documentation strategies.
The FE curriculum is critical in empowering students with essential financial knowledge, practical skills, and value-based learning, fostering lifelong learning, financial resilience, and responsible citizenship.
In total, 40 educational documents have been produced across the three workshops (two similar workshops held in 2024), all of which were funded by CEFI and delivered in collaboration with the DoE. This outstanding effort marks a national commitment to embedding financial literacy across all stages of formal education in Papua New Guinea."
Ok Tedi Expands Mining Footprint,20/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4524,"Ok Tedi Mining Limited (Ok Tedi) has entered into an agreement to acquire the Misima Gold and Silver Project from Kingston Resources Limited for about PGK153 million (approximately A$60 million and US$38 million).
The deal will include additional contingent payments of up to about PGK89 million (A$35 million and US$22 million).
The acquisition marks a pivotal expansion for Ok Tedi, which operates the country's longest-running open-pit copper, gold, and silver mine in Western Province. The Misima Project, located 625 kilometers east of Port Moresby in Milne Bay Province, boasts an estimated resource of 3.8 million ounces of gold and 22.1 million ounces of silver.
Ok Tedi Chairman Mark Stone described the acquisition as a “significant step” in the company’s evolution into a multi-mine business, highlighting the government’s support for long-term sector growth.
“Papua New Guinea is a mineral-rich land with many natural assets just waiting to be unlocked, and the Misima mine, with its 3.8Moz resource together with potential exploration upside, is a great example of that,” Mr Stone said. “We hope that bringing Ok Tedi’s strong operational capability to another national resource will contribute to the Government’s Vision 2050.”
Managing Director and chief executive officer, Kedi Ilimbit, echoed this optimism, stating the company is entering an “exciting period of expansion” under its Growth 2050 vision.
“We have many great projects on the horizon… the reopening of Misima gold is just one early step in the journey,” Mr Ilimbit said.

Upgrades to ATW road unveiled,20/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4522,"Deputy Chief of the Australian Air Force, Air Vice Marshal Harvey Reynolds and PNGDF Chief of Force Preparation Colonel Craig Solomon have officially opened the upgraded Access Road to the Air Transport Wing (ATW).
The upgrade of the Jackson Access Road was delivered through the Defence Cooperation Program (DCP), Australia’s longstanding defence partnership program with PNG.
The project was delivered with a local Papua New Guinean construction contractor. The original unsealed road severely restricted vehicle movement, making access to the ATW difficult and dangerous. The upgrade included the replacement of the unsealed road with a more resilient, sealed asphalt road.
To enhance community safety and security, a footpath alongside the access road has been installed. The footpath provides much safer access to those travelling to the area on foot, including to the medical centres. Road lighting and road signage have been included to further improve safety and security.
A major element of the upgrade was addressing the longstanding drainage issues on the road which previously caused flash flooding, rapid road deterioration and diminished road usability. The upgrade included the installation of refurbished drainage systems.
“We are thankful to the ADF for coming through the DCP to refurbish the access road. This is just a small part of the partnership program we (PNGDF) have with the ADF,” Chief of Force Preparation Colonel Craig Solomon said.
“Through the dedication of the ATW, the PNGDF Air Element is an incredible capability, and the ADF is proud to be a part of its journey,” said Deputy Chief of Air Force, Air Vice Marshal Harvey Reynolds.
Australia and Papua New Guinea share a close and longstanding defence partnership built on cooperation and trust. The upgrade to the access road will support the PNGDF to deliver on PNG government priorities."

Morobe schools want principals dismissed,20/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4516,"Three secondary schools in Morobe Province have been calling for the dismissal of their respective principals.
The schools are Bumayong Lutheran Secondary School in Lae, Grace Memorial Secondary School in Wau and Dregerhafen Secondary School in Finschhafen.
School fighting has been constantly disrupting classes at Bumayong and Dregerhafen, where countless students and members of the community have been injured since the beginning of the 2025 academic year.
The fighting is not exclusive to this year only. Bumayong and Dregerhafen have come under the spotlight in previous years for the constant fights that have led to very low academic performances from them every year.
On the other hand, Wau-Waria district’s only secondary school; Grace Memorial, have petitioned for the removal of their principal due to mismanagement, negligence and abuse of school assets.
Currently, a teacher and her children are living in the dormitory due to no accommodation, with students and staff claiming that the principal, Oting Zuhuke, has repeatedly refused to hold dialogue with them.
The Morobe Provincial Education Board (PEB) is aware of these matters and has indicated that they will be visiting the respective schools this week to assess the situation.
“It is within the powers of the PEB to appoint and dismiss principals,” this newsroom was told.
“The PEB will need to look at the root cause of these issues; where it started from, who caused it, and so on. Nobody else can do this except the PEB; not even our school inspectors or district education managers.
“The PEB is authorised by law to make these decisions.”"

Prime Minister James Marape has reaffirmed his Government’s commitment to advancing the rights and well-being of children and young people in Papua New Guinea during a high-level meeting on Monday, May 19, with UNICEF, the United Nations, and key development partners in the capital, Port Moresby.
The meeting brought together senior government officials, including NCD Governor Powes Parkop and Minister for Community Development, Youth and Religion Jason Peter, to discuss shared priorities in education, healthcare, nutrition, and youth empowerment.

“Papua New Guinea’s 50th anniversary presents a unique opportunity to secure a better future for millions of children and harness the country’s demographic dividend,” she said.
The discussion highlighted the importance of improving access to education, immunisation, protecting children from violence, and advancing the implementation of the Civil Identity Registry Act to ensure all children are registered at birth and able to access essential services.
The PM highlighted the urgent need to tackle child stunting and improve access to clean water and sanitation — critical priorities for PNG, where one in two children are affected by stunting.
He emphasised the vision of a healthier generation, beginning with ensuring every child grows up with proper nutrition and safe, reliable access to clean water and sanitation services.
UN Resident Coordinator Dr Richard Howard commended the collaborative spirit of the meeting, saying Papua New Guinea’s children represent the nation’s greatest hope for the future.
“By working together, we can ensure that every child grows up healthy, well-nourished, educated, and safe from harm. The UN stands ready to support the Government’s vision,” he added.
A key outcome of the meeting was the proposal for a Parliamentary Committee focused on Children and Youth to oversee policies, funding, and accountability measures.

The Universal Church recently activated its ""Night Angel"" initiative, a program dedicated to reaching out to and supporting those on the streets during the night.
Teams from the Universal Church ventured out into Port Moresby, specifically visiting the 4 Mile and 3 Mile areas. It was a moving experience for the team members to meet and hear directly from people living on the streets about the circumstances that led to their homelessness.
Many individuals shared heartbreaking stories of their daily struggles for survival. They spoke of the challenge to find food, sometimes going days without eating. Some explained they ended up on the streets due to mistreatment from their families.
One striking story was of an entire family who had been homeless for 28 years, surviving by collecting cans, selling small items at markets, or depending on the compassion of strangers for food.
Those living on the streets described life as ""restless and sleepless.""
During the day, they wander, searching for something to eat or a way to earn a little money. At night, they return to their usual sleeping spots, often only to be disturbed or chased away just as they try to rest. They emphasized the constant struggle and pain to survive on the streets of Port Moresby.
In response, the Universal Church's Night Angel team provided practical help in the form of food. Importantly, they also shared words of faith and encouragement, assuring individuals that with God's help, their situations can change.
They extended an invitation, challenging people to use their faith and come to the House of God, believing they will be blessed and can transform their past hardships into future testimonies.
Bishop Jonathan Pine said this outreach reflects the spirit of the scripture: ""I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;"" (Matthew 25:35 NKJV).
An invitation is open to anyone needing help and support to know it is available. The Universal Church is open every day at 24 Gabaka St, Gordons, Port Moresby (Opposite Duffy and Hitron)."

"Moses , King named in Yeo-led Blues team for Origin I",19/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4498,"Isaah Yeo will captain the Westpac NSW Blues in Origin I, while Mitchell Moses has won the five-eighth spot and prop Max King was named for his representative debut.
Laurie Daley has named his first Blues side since returning to the coaching role this season and has stuck closely to the team which won last year's series for the Origin opener at Suncorp Stadium on May 28.
Yeo takes over the captaincy from Jake Trbojevic, who was unavailable after suffering a head knock in Townsville on Saturday night, and will start at lock in place of the injured Cameron Murray after being on the bench last season.
Moses edged out his 2024 Origin II and III halves partner Jarome Luai to play alongside superstar playmaker Nathan Cleary.
However, the biggest selection surprise was King, 28, on the bench for his Origin debut - joining his grandfather Johnny King, an NRL Hall of Fame inductee, as a NSW representative.
Dylan Edwards retains the fullback jersey ahead of James Tedesco, while Daley has shown faith in wingers Brian To'o and Zac Lomax, who have both played one match since returning from injury.
As a result, there was no room for Sea Eagles star Tom Trbojevic.
Latrell Mitchell and Stephen Crichton are the centres, as they were in last year's emphatic Origin II win at the MCG, while Cleary returns after missing the second and third match of the 2024 series through injury.
Moses was his replacement, and he will now play alongside the superstar playmaker at five-eighth.
The forward pack of Yeo at lock, second-rowers Liam Martin and Angus Crichton, props Payne Haas and Mitchell Barnett, and hooker Reece Robson all played in Origin III as NSW regained the Shield.
Interchange prop Spencer Leniu and utility Connor Watson were also members of the winning Blues side, while second-rower Hudson Young returns after being dropped for the series decider.
Murray, Trbojevic and Bradman Best were all unavailable from the team that played in Origin III at Suncorp Stadium, while Luai was overlooked.
With injury concerns over Haas (quad) and Stephen Crichton (groin), Daley has named forwards Stefano Utoikamanu and  Haumole Olakau’atu and centre Campbell Graham in an extended 20-man squad.
The Maroons team will be announced on Monday morning, but Canterbury officials have confirmed that veteran utility Kurt Mann, who plays as a middle forward for the Bulldogs, would be the club's second Origin debutant.

The estimated TB incidence in Papua New Guinea in 2016 was 432 cases per 100 000 population.
TB is caused by airborne bacteria affecting the lungs. It’s one of the oldest known diseases in the world and is also preventable and curable. The symptoms include coughing – sometimes with blood, chest pains, weakness, weight loss, fever and night sweats.
TB requires lengthy and complicated medical care therefore in 2008, the PNG National Department of Health (NDoH) initiated and introduced the directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS).
DOTS is the World Health Organization-approved approach to treating TB, bringing the necessary medical facilities and education to communities where it’s needed most. NDoH recognized that there was a need for DOTS as a control strategy due to the very high rates of ‘loss to follow up rate (LTFU refers to TB patients that do not complete their full course of) in PNG.
With support from The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria grant in PNG, the Central Provincial Health Authority (CPHA) through its partner World Vision PNG (who are supporting some areas of implementation of its TB program) co-facilitated a Village Health Assistants (VHAs) training held on Friday 2nd May at the City Boutique Hotel in Port Moresby.
During the one-day training, 14 Village Health Assistants (VHAs) selected from various facilities in Central Province were brought together to learn new skills to support the work of the CPHA to combat the TB burden in the province.
Guided by the National Guidelines on Community TB Prevention and Care, VHAs will support with:
Active TB case finding activities, sputum collection and transportation, treatment supervision, support and monitoring (treatment support and adherence), health education and counseling, advocacy, awareness raising, community engagement and mobilization, provide community TB preventive treatment, support delivery of TB/HIV services, attend trainings/meetings with CPHA as scheduled, meet with clinical staff in the BMU/health facilities on a weekly basis and submit monthly reports and records of the patients under their care.
The training was aimed at equipping the VHAs with the necessary knowledge, skills, and tools to support CPHA provide adherence support to patients such as DOTS, promote infection control practices and enhance case finding through screening and referral of contacts, facilitate community engagement and education activities around TB whilst also providing refreshers around compliance and safeguarding policies on patient care.
Following the training, one VHA, Rei Waena mentioned that he felt more confident in delivering tasks when out in the community and was now able to safely identify safeguarding violations because he understands compliance and safeguarding policies better.
Another VHA, Egona John from Kwikila Health Centre remarked that the refresher was good for the newly engaged VHAs and also for him because it reiterated and reinforced their respective responsibilities as VHAs and how they too have a duty of care in their respective roles in their communities.
During her closing remarks at the end of the VHA training, World Visions Provincial Support Supervisor, Evans Ereman, thanked participants for their time and acknowledged The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria program for supporting the training and work of the Central Province Health Authority, National Department of Health and Government of PNG in the fight against TB."

Simbu Invests in Health Future,17/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4484,"In a milestone ceremony filled with pride and purpose, 43 students graduated with diplomas in Nursing and First Aid from the Kundiawa College of Community Health Workers (CHW), marking the institution’s 10th graduation since its establishment in 2012.
The event, hosted at the Simbu Provincial Government ceremonial ground, highlighted a decade-long dream of building local health capacity through education.
The college, born from a Memorandum of Agreement between the Simbu Provincial Government and the Simbu Provincial Health Authority during Governor Noah Kool’s first term, stands as a cornerstone in the province’s long-term vision of strengthening its human resources.
Governor Kool, who continues to champion this vision in his current term, emphasised the importance of investing in health workers who can serve their communities directly.
“Our greatest resource is our people,” said Governor Kool. “Each graduate today represents a future of better healthcare for Simbu. This dream began ten years ago, and it continues stronger than ever.”
Representing the National Department of Health, Julie Dobsie, Technical Curriculum Development Officer, acknowledged the graduates’ achievements while introducing a revised curriculum.
She noted the completion of the original 49-module program and the start of a new approach that aligns more closely with current healthcare demands.
“The new curriculum will prepare our health workers not only with technical knowledge but with compassion and commitment,” Dobsie stated. “A community health worker must treat every patient as a shepherd does their sheep—with care, respect, and duty.”
The ceremony not only celebrated academic success but also underscored the human impact of the program.
Many graduates are expected to return to remote and underserved areas, where their skills will help address critical healthcare gaps.
The Kundiawa CHW College is a positive path of hope for Simbu Province, showing how local leadership, educational investment, and vision can combine to build a healthier future for all."

PM Urges Nationwide Preparation for 50th Independence Celebrations,17/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4480,"Prime Minister James Marape has issued a national call to action for all levels of government, communities, and citizens across Papua New Guinea to actively prepare for the country’s historic 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations on September 16, 2025.
“With just four months remaining before our golden jubilee, I appeal to all provinces, districts, and local governments to begin organising meaningful celebrations in their communities,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Fifty years only comes once in our lifetime. It is a moment of reflection, pride, and unity for all Papua New Guineans.”
Prime Minister Marape emphasised that despite facing many challenges over the past five decades—social, economic, political, and developmental—Papua New Guinea has stood firm in preserving its democracy, sovereignty, and identity as a free and independent nation.
“Our country remains intact,” he said. “Through all the ups and downs, we have produced leaders from all corners of the nation—Prime Ministers, Governors-General, Opposition Leaders, Speakers, Chief Justices, Police Commissioners, Defence Force Commanders— and that reflects the strength of our national unity and diversity.”
He called on citizens across all four regions and from all ethnic and language groups to take ownership of the milestone and prepare activities that truly reflect PNG’s journey.
“This is not just a government event—it’s a national celebration for all our people,” he said. “We want the 50th anniversary to be the mother of all celebrations. Let us come together as one nation, many tribes, many tongues, but one people under one flag.”
Prime Minister Marape said a full year of commemorative activities will run from September 16, 2025, to September 15, 2026, and will include the PNG Games in Southern Highlands, community festivals, educational campaigns, inter-governmental programmes, and major infrastructure launches.
“Our 50th anniversary marks the beginning of a national reset,” the Prime Minister said.
“It is a time to renew our commitment to building a better, safer, stronger country.”

Manus Highway project behind schedule,17/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4478,"The upgrading and sealing of the 32.2 km stretch of road from NBC Junction to Kawa Primary School along the Manus East West Highway will not meet its contracted completion timeline.
The delay has been attributed to cashflow issues, material shortages, and the non-availability of machinery and equipment parts.
This road contract was set to be completed in May 2025 following the singing on 19 May 2022. However, the project schedule now has been amended with a 10-month extension.
Acting Chief Secretary to Government Ivan Pomaleu says a joint report from the National Department of Works and Highways, the EPC contractor and ALBE Consultants Ltd, confirms partial progress on clearing, sub-base, base course, drainage and surface priming and sealing.
He said the report outlines that the full Manus East West Highway spans 150 km under Phase 1 of the Connect PNG Program.
The current contract covers the upgrading and sealing of 32.2 km, valued at K115.99 million. According to the Contract Agreement, K58.68 million has been certified, and K23.66 million has been paid to the contractor.
There are also outstanding progress claims under review for payment."
Local derby looms in Round 6,16/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4477,"Round 6 of the Digicel Exxon Mobil Cup is set to showcase some highly anticipated battles as teams intensify their efforts and focus on their game strategies. The action will kick off on Saturday at three locations: Rabaul, Kimbe, and Minj, leading into an exciting lineup of matches on Sunday.
For rugby league fans in Port Moresby, an intriguing matchup is on the horizon between neighbors Gas Resources Central Dabaris and PRK Gulf Isou at the Santos National Football Stadium on Sunday. This clash will be preceded by the Central Dabaris U19 team taking on the Mt. Hagen Eagles U19 in Round 1 of the inaugural National Youth Competition at 1 PM.
Meanwhile Dabaris are looking to build on their commendable performance against the Enga Mioks last week. However, they won’t underestimate the young and talented Gulf Isou side, who are currently playing with increased confidence, energy, and improved structure in their set plays. After recording their first win in Round 1 against the Kimbe Cutters, the Roger Laka-coached team has faced a few narrow losses against marquee teams in the competition, including a close match against Waghi Tumbe, where they lost 18-20 last week in Minj. This indicates that a win is within reach, thus Dabaris will need to be wary of the challenge that awaits them on Sunday.
A bumper crowd is anticipated at the Lae Rugby League Field for the top-of-the-table clash on Sunday, featuring first-placed Lae Snax Tigers against second-placed PRK Mendi Muruks.
Meanwhile, Bintangor Goroka Lahanis will be eager to bounce back when they host Enga Mioks at the National Sports Institute. This main match will be preceded by a National Youth Competition Round 1 clash between Lahanis U19 and Lae Tigers U19.
On Saturday, the iconic Queens Park in Rabaul is expected to be packed to capacity as foundation clubs and longtime rivals, East New Britain Gurias and Moni Plus NCDC Port Moresby Vipers, face off. The Gurias will be looking to make amends for their loss against the Muruks last week.
Meanwhile, across the border in West New Britain, the Peter Humphreys Oval in Kimbe will be buzzing as the Kimbe Cutters host Hela Wigmen. Still searching for their first win after five rounds, the Cutters showed glimpses of their potential last week, giving the Port Moresby Vipers a tough challenge before falling short in the final minutes. They will look to leverage their home-ground advantage for a strong performance against the Wigmen.
The local rivalry continues in Minj as the struggling 2024 premiers, Mt. Hagen Eagles, face off against Asila Waghi Tumbe on Saturday."
Two new LLGs for Nipa,16/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4476,"Upper Nipa and Nipa Urban Local Level Governments (LLGs) have been split from the Nipa Basin Local Level Government in the Nipa-Kutubu District of Southern Highlands Province.
Local MP and Minister for Defence, Dr Billy Joseph, Nipa Basin LLG president John Titus and 39 councilors in a recent ceremony in Nipa, released the new newly established LLGs for the 2025 Local Level Government elections.
The reasons behind the split are primarily due to administrative and governance challenges related to population size, geographic area, and service delivery.
There have been longstanding issues of lawlessness, poor development, and poor government service delivery in the area, which fueled the need for better administrative structures.
The split aims to improve government service delivery and development coordination in line with national policy goals like Vision 2050.
The factors led to calls by local leaders and members of parliament to split Nipa Basin and create new LLGs such as Upper Nipa and Nipa Urban for more effective governance and service delivery.
Dr Billy thanked the councilors for their service at the wards level for which they are paid like any other public servants and reminded them of the important role they play in governance and leadership.
He urged them and those aspiring candidates to run their campaigns peacefully without threats or intimidation and wished them all the best in the upcoming council elections."
SHPG subsidies school fees,16/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4474,"The Southern Highlands Provincial Government today presented a cheque of K828 000 to subsidise the school fee of more than 700 SHP students at the University of Papua New Guinea.
SHP Governor, William Powi presented the dummy cheque today to student leaders in Port Moresby.
The presentation was also to demonstrate the provincial government’s roll out of the school fee subsidy scheme to all universities around the country.
The first subsidy presentation of K68 000 was done at Western Pacific University on April 11 for SHP students studying there.
Under this scheme, each student will receive a K1000 subsidy from the provincial government.
SHPH allocated two million kina in the 2025 budget for university subsidies and has released that allocation to universities across the country.
Governor Powi in presenting the cheque noted that there is a lot to do, but his government is doing its best to ensure parents are assisted.
“We want to announce to the people of Southern Highlands that the provincial government is not just doing nothing. We are partnering with the parents and students to ensure that they are supported in this manner.
“We are doing what we can. The needs are very big of which I wish I had all the resources to support all the different institutions but this is the best we can do. We are trialing it out. I expect the students to not take these things for granted but appreciate it and make the best out of it as the Southern Highlands Provincial Government is equally investing in your future,” Powi said.
Another three million kina has been allocated to assist SHP students at Parul University in India. That funding will be presented later in the year when the executives of Parul University visit the country.
SHP provincial Administrator, David Kelma in thanking the provincial government for taking this bold step to assist students also announced the continuation of this program in the years ahead.
“The provincial government will continue this scheme of supporting students going forward. We are not just going to stop here. Governor Powi is adamant, he wants to support, he understands the importance of supporting our Human Resource. The only set back we had in past years was the issues in the province that put a lot of challenge on us so that’s why we did not continue the program. But going forward, starting this year onwards, the provincial government and the administration is supportive of the students attending universities.”
Representing not just the UPNG Southern Highlands students but all university students benefiting from this scheme, President of the UPNG Southern Highlands Students Association, Justice Moya welcomed the subsidy and thanked the provincial government for recognizing the SHP students studying in the universities around the country."
Independence Retirees study commissioned,16/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4471,"The commissioning of a study into old retirees of both private and public services who commenced work around the Papua New Guinea independence era (16th September 1975), took place at the Bible Translation Association Hall on Tuesday May 13, 2025.
Andy Bawa, a private entrepreneur sponsored the study to take place in the National Capital District. Bawa said with celebrations brewing for PNG’s 50 years of Independence, it is only fitting for these particular sectors of the population to be recognized.
He said he wanted all elderly retirees to be interviewed to establish if they have problems, or needs and wants that they would like to bring up.
The four-week survey will be carried out by an organization called Mado Wain Association Inc. Bawa said the association has sound local knowledge of geographical and community settings in Port Moresby and has cost effective methods to carry out this work. Some 200 youths from 12 Ward areas are on stand-by to assist with this survey.
“By 21st July 2025 the findings of the study would be made known,” Bawa said.
In representing the retiree officers, Nick Klapat expressed appreciation on the study while he revealed struggles and suffering endured by retirees like himself.
Kiap recalled that in his capacity as a kiap or patrol officer 50 years ago, he climbed mountains to unite people and prepare for independence in September 1975.
He said some of the people left employment without their full entitlements, while others got their entitlements but had the customary obligation to share among the family members, so their final entitlement was depleted in less than a year and it remains so to this day.
Gong Ned Kabug, Program Director of Mado Wain Association Inc, assured Mr Bawa that he would be collaborating with Congregation Chairman of different churches in Motu Koitabu villages to carry out the study."
SPA undergoing reviews,16/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4466,"The Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs (DPLLGA) has conducted a comprehensive review of the Special Purpose Authority (SPA) to evaluate its effectiveness as a service delivery mechanism for Local Level Governments (LLGs).
The review identified systemic challenges, operational inefficiencies, and opportunities to strengthen SPA’s role in decentralizing service delivery.
Deputy Secretary of DPLLGA Larson Thomas announced this during the swearing-in of new board members of the Southeast Mananda Special Purpose Authority on Tuesday in Port Moresby.
This review focused on assessing the operational and institutional effectiveness of the Service Providers Association (SPA) in its role as a service delivery mechanism for Local Level Governments (LLGs).
Mr Thomas said a report from this review recommended certain policy and legislative reforms to be made to enable DPLGA as the regulator of SPAs to manage the affairs of SPAs.
Main policy and legislative reforms done so far include:
-A model SPA Constitution is now being developed and will be used as a Standardized Constitution for all SPAs to adopt once it is approved by Minister;
-Amendments to section 45 and 50 of LLG Administration Act has been made to ensure accountability and prudent management of public funds allocated for service delivery to SPAs.
Mr Thomas explained that the amendment of section 45 of the Local Level Government Act has been amended to remove and ban Chairman and the Board members of the LLG SPAs from being signatories to bank accounts.
He further clarified that section 50 is amended to include specific powers for Minister responsible to take punitive actions against Chairman, Board and Management of SPA if deemed abusing office."

The Council highlighted the cases of former TV reporter James Guken, and FM100 Talkback Show host, Culligan Tanda.
Guken says he was terminated without notice after writing an online news article quoting the Parliamentary Opposition. Tanda was initially suspended for three weeks without pay following a NASFUND FM100 Talkback Show programme which featured the Governor of East Sepik Allan Bird following the last Vote of No Confidence motion in parliament. Subsequently, Tanda was issued a termination notice upon the completion of his suspension period Wednesday this week.
Yesterday Prime Minister James Marape told this newsroom that he has advised his Chief of Staff to find out from the FM100 management what its reasons are for Tanda’s termination and if they can state them publicly for the nation to hear.
The Council also reminded the managements of State-owned media organisations, that Section 5 of the Organic Law on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (OLICAC) includes within the definition of corrupt conduct by public officials, the dishonest exercising and abusing of official functions.
The Council has called on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) to investigate the matter for corrupt conduct and establish if processes were abused when panelising both Tanda and Guken for their reporting.
“A free, robust, and independent media is an essential pillar of democracy,” stated Media Council President Neville Choi. “It is the cornerstone of allowing freedom of speech, and freedom of expression.”"
Church wins court battle over 2022 eviction,15/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4457,"The National Court at Waigani has awarded over K4 million in damages when it ruled in favour of Morata One Seventh-Day Adventist Church and 22 other Block Holders of Morata One, against Sixth Estate Limited company and the State.
The case is in relation to an eviction that was carried out at the Morata One suburb in the National Capital District between October 12 and 14, 2022.
The National Court, presided by Justice John Carey, handed down the decision on April 17, 2025, in favour of the SDA Church and the 22 other Block Holders of Morata 1, and awarded them damages of over K4 million, covering loss of church buildings, block holders’ properties, breach of constitutional rights, and costs.
After carrying out investigations of their own, the aggrieved residents, including the church, found the October 2022 eviction to be illegal and improper. They engaged a lawyer, Silas Kaule of Kaule Legal and filed court proceedings against the police and the company that ordered this eviction, Sixth Estate Limited.
The plaintiffs claimed in the proceedings that the company and the Police conducted an eviction on settlers residing on a piece of land owned by Sixth Estate Limited, identified as Portion 2733 Morata. However, during the eviction, they encroached and trespassed onto a nearby land portion occupied by the SDA church and 22 other Block Holders.
The nearby land occupied by the SDA church and the other 22 Block Holders was way outside the boundary of Portion 2733. It was alleged, amongst other things, that the company’s action was illegal in that it did not have title to the land occupied by the SDA Church. Furthermore, there was no court order authorizing the eviction of residents on the land occupied by the SDA church."

Call for proper investigation into plane crash,15/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4455,"Former NCD/Central Assistant Commissioner of Police, Anthony Wagambie Jnr is calling for proper investigations into the fatal plane crash that took the lives of five Papua New Guineans in Morobe Province last December.
Wagambie Jnr said this during the funeral service of his brother, late Senior Constable Napolean Wagambie, one of the passengers who died in the plane crash.
He said the outcome of the investigations will ensure that proper processes and procedures are followed to avoid such incidents from happening in the future.
“We must pursue this to ensure a proper investigation takes place, an aircraft investigation, and a coroner's inquest must take place, and we must find out what happened.
“We police officers get deployed to rural areas when there is an operation, and the only means of transport is through small aircraft. Therefore, we call for a proper investigation to ensure that other police officers or civilians will not go through this experience.
“I never want any other family to go through the experience we have gone through. It is one of the worst experiences when you don’t have answers, no witnesses, you are helpless, you cannot drive out to the crash site. We were waiting and hoping that those sent there would bring us good answers. However, the reality has unfolded and there is nothing much we can do but live on with his memories,” Wagambie Jnr added.

Children at risk as poliovirus confirmed,15/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4454,"UNICEF is stepping up its support to the PNG Government to ensure every child is vaccinated following the detection of poliovirus.
The detection has triggered a national emergency response to protect children across the country, supported by UNICEF and partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Australian Government.
UNICEF will support the Government to strengthen surveillance, procure and deliver vaccines, prepare for two rounds of nationwide polio vaccination. It will also assist provincial health authorities to engage communities, raise awareness, and encourage parents and caregivers to vaccinate their children.
UNICEF Papua New Guinea Representative, Dr Veera Mendonca said while there’s no cure for polio, the disease can easily be prevented by ensuring every child is immunised.
“This is why UNICEF is working with the Government of Papua New Guinea and other partners to stop the virus in its tracks and ensure all children are protected,” she said.
Highlighting the important role of churches, Dr Mendonca said UNICEF is actively working with church and community leaders to reach every family and protect every child. “We need their voices to promote accurate information and encourage vaccination,” she said.
Dr Mendonca added that UNICEF is working closely with national task forces on resource mobilisation, communication, and outbreak control.
“Technical specialists in immunisation, cold chain, advocacy, and social behaviour change are already deployed at national and provincial levels, including Morobe and the National Capital District,” she said.
“We call on community leaders, churches, media outlets, and other organisations to help share accurate facts and dispel any rumours or misinformation,” she added.
Dr Mendonca noted that Papua New Guinea had been declared polio-free for 25 years, yet low routine immunisation coverage has left many children vulnerable.
“While the focus right now is on stopping this outbreak, we must take this opportunity to boost routine immunisation to 90 per cent and protect children long-term,” Dr Mendonca said.
UNICEF joins the National Department of Health (NDOH), WHO, the Australian Government and other partners in urging all parents and caregivers to bring their children for vaccination, check immunisation cards, and report any signs of illness.
“Together, we can stop this outbreak and keep Papua New Guinea polio-free — for our children, for our families, and for our communities,” Dr Mendonca said."
Retired teachers await Governor Wenge,15/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4453,"Retired teachers in Morobe Province, who are now in their 60s and 70s, have been sitting at Tutumang Haus all week to follow up on Governor Luther Wenge’s commitment.
The teachers, who have retired as early as 2015, are awaiting a K2 million repatriation funding that was promised by Governor Wenge in 2023.
Governor Wenge had announced in one of his forums at Tutumang that the provincial government will support retirees’ repatriation back to their home provinces, aside from the commitment made to support pastors, widows, people with disability and the elderly; promises that are yet to be kept.
Newaidaya Stoesel, from Goodenough Island in Milne Bay Province, graduated in 1981 from Balob Teachers College, came to Morobe from Misima in 1987, and taught until her retirement in 2023.
Married to a man from Finschhafen, where she spent most of her teaching years at, Stoesel outlined that the governor advised them that discretionary funds will be used to repatriate them.
“When the governor found out that teachers who were retired, were stranded, he got up and spoke in the month of October 2023 that he’s prepared to meet this repatriation,” she said. “And we were very happy. He cried and we all cried too. That was the first cry we made with him.
“And we really dropped tears, believing, trusting that the next minute, we will get that money and we will go home,” she explained in typical Milne Bay English, surrounded by her peers.
“Unfortunately, we waited, and waited, and waited and we are still waiting because there are a lot of commitments in the province. We cannot deny it. It’s a big province. But governor still told us that he will make sure that he meets the retired teachers’ fees to go home.
“It was very encouraging to us and we are patient.”
Sakale Popen, who hails from Manus, started teaching in Eastern Highlands Province in 1977. He taught there for 22 years then moved to Manus in 1998, stayed there for a year-and-a-half before becoming a school inspector in West New Britain Province.
From there, he came to Morobe and started teaching at Lababia in Salamaua, before moving to Lanakapi, Bumayong, Tent City’s St. Patrick's Catholic Primary School, St. Martin’s Catholic Primary School then to Markham Road primary. He eventually retired on January 25th, 2021.
“Since 2021 to 2025, we have been waiting for our repatriation entitlements,” he shared. At this stage, we are getting closer to receiving our entitlements; hopefully this week or next week.
“There are more than 100 retired teachers because it goes back to 2015 to 2023. Now some of them have retired in 2024 and 2025 and are waiting for their entitlements.”
The retirees had petitioned the provincial government in 2024 to send them home, with governor Wenge saying the provincial executive council has allocated K2 million for the exercise in the 2025 budget.
It is estimated that K3.5 million will be needed to repatriate the 219 retirees and while waiting, they have lost some of their counterparts through the years."

With the new system in place the Department of National Planning & Monitoring (DNPM), through its WaSH Program Management Unit will equip the people of the country with real-time data to inform planning and resource allocation, transparency, coordination and accountability across all levels of government in the WaSH space.
DNPM, with the assistance of the Australian Government, invested K1.5 million to upgrade the system and rollout across the country.
“This platform has now evolved into a more dynamic, user-friendly and customized platform, renamed the UMBEN Platform. The UMBEN platform, meaning fishing net in English, is inspired by the image of a net cast into the sea, capturing everything in its part in the same way.
“The spirit of this initiative is a shift towards more effective, coordinated and inclusive service delivery throughout the country. UMBEN is not just a technical upgrade. It's a game changer for how we plan, deliver and monitor our services across Papua New Guinea,” National WaSH Programs Coordinator, Takale Tuna.
The platform will give updates on thematic dashboards, maps, monitors and reports on WaSH sectors across the country. Since the launch of the system in 2017, data has been collected across 31 districts, including 3095 rural communities, 1,577 schools and 416 health care facilities.
“One statistic that stands out in particular for me and for the Australian Government is around households spending one to two hours a day, on average, due to basic wash services and accessing water, collecting water time that could be spent in employment or education, or spending time with family,” Tuna said.
“Projects like this, which bring together data so that we can use it for planning and coordination, will hopefully increase that access, reducing the time spent by families and communities in doing things like collecting water.
“This particular burden is also felt more by women, meaning a lack of wash is a critical barrier to women's empowerment and gender equality. All partners believe strongly that resiliency, resilient wash services are the foundation to increase individual, household, and community resilience and help us all improve livelihoods, security and reduce poverty.”"
Vipers groom young talent,14/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4442,"The Port Moresby Vipers kicked off the 2025 Digicel ExxonMobil Cup season with victories, looking ahead to a promising competition, with emphasis now on youth development.
Club chief executive officer, Ronnie Titie has provided an insight into the club’s vision, he emphasised the importance of integrating young players into the team.
“While it’s a work in progress, the latest statistics show promising signs,” he stated. The youthful Vipers are beginning to embrace the elite level of competition with newfound confidence.
As a foundation club in the national rugby league, the Vipers have struggled since their last premiership title in 2013. Titie noted that the club is undergoing a comprehensive overhaul of its systems, including coaching, player selection, and scouting of younger talents who can add value for the long term.
""This year, we’ve made changes to our playing group and coaching staff. We have two rookie coaches, Wellington Albert and Brandon Gotuno, who bring fresh perspectives to the team.
“Most of our players are drawn from the PRL and our Vipers Academy, along with talent from the Governors Cup and suburban leagues. This year’s squad is a good mix, with only two senior players—our captain and vice-captain, Gilmor Paul and Fedro Gene.”
Titie highlighted the effort put into fostering team cohesion. “We’ve worked hard to get the boys to gel, and so far, we’ve achieved four wins and one draw. It’s been a long time since we had that winning spirit. We recognize there’s always room for improvement.”
The squad features promising young talent, Manesah Watt from Bavaroko Junior High and Benard Lai from Gerehu Secondary, alongside university students.
Titie expressed excitement about the next generation of players, including sons of PRL legends Joseph Nipal and Robert Akunai, who are ready to carve out their legacies.
“Eddie Nipal, coming from rugby union, is adapting to league, while Norman Akunai has shown great resilience after recovering from surgery. They’re following in their fathers’ footsteps and have brought significant energy to the team,” he added.
To provide leadership on the field, co-captains Gilmor Paul and Fedro Gene have been instrumental in guiding the young squad. “They lead by example and foster a sense of unity among the players. We tell them to play for each other, their families, the club, and the people of NCD. We aim to restore the city’s pride and relive the glory days.”
With a renewed focus on youth and a clear vision for the future, the Port Moresby Vipers are positioning themselves as a formidable force in a couple of years."
Feeder road rehabilitation brings new hope to South Wiru coffee farmers,14/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4439,"A vital feeder road linking coffee-growing communities from Kamborini to Wala in the South Wiru LLG of Ialibu Pangia District of Southern Highlands is under rehabilitation.
The road works is under the Papua New Guinea Agriculture Commercialization and Diversification (PACD) Project, supported by the World Bank and the Government of Papua New Guinea.
Speaking at the project site, PACD Coffee manager, Potaisa Hombunaka emphasised that the 5.5km road upgrade is more than just a transport improvement—it is an economic lifeline that will unlock opportunities for thousands of coffee farmers.
“This is not free money from the World Bank or the Government,” Hombunaka told the gathering of local leaders, farmers, and stakeholders.
“This is a loan project, and it is critical that we use this support responsibly to ensure our coffee can reach the market, and the returns from coffee flow back into our communities.”
The road, identified as a priority under the Coffee Component of the PACD Project and implemented by the Coffee Industry Corporation Ltd (CICL), is being supervised by the Coffee Project Management Unit.
Local company Bushdog Construction Limited has been contracted to carry out the works.
Hombunaka explained that the rehabilitation of the Kamborini-Wala road is expected to directly benefit between 3,000 to 4,000 coffee households in the area, potentially increasing annual production from the current 78,000 parchment coffee bags to over 100,000 bags.
“This road is a pathway for our people to connect to markets, earn better incomes, and improve their lives,” Mr Hombunaka said.
“Projects like this are about transforming rural livelihoods, empowering farmers, and connecting isolated communities to the broader economy.”
He acknowledged the historical challenges faced under previous programs such as the PPAP Project but said the PACD is now building on those lessons, ensuring projects are delivered with greater efficiency and accountability.
“This road is a symbol of hope for South Wiru,” Mr Hombunaka stressed.
“We thank the World Bank and the Government for this partnership, and we urge our people to take ownership, protect this infrastructure, and use it to grow their coffee industry.”"
Call for parents to ensure children’s safety,14/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4436,"Following the gruesome discovery of the decomposing bodies of two children in an abandoned vehicle in Gereka in the National Capital District, police are calling on parents and guardians to take their responsibilities seriously to protect their children.
The children, aged four and five are cousins and were reported missing on the afternoon of March 02nd between 3pm and 4pm.

Winners of Homemade Ideas,14/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4430,"From survival to innovation, three local entrepreneurs are using creativity and compassion to change lives through Papua New Guinea’s 2025 Search for Best Homemade Product.
Their stories aren’t just about business — they’re about healing, sustainability, and hope.
Three extraordinary Papua New Guineans have turned personal battles and everyday challenges into powerful products that are now national award-winners.
In the just-announced results of the 2025 Lily Homemade Product Competition, Carole Cholai, Geno Geno, and Nicholar Boas were named winners in the wearable, useful, and edible categories, respectively — each product deeply rooted in PNG’s materials, and even more so in its humanity.
For breast cancer survivor Carole Cholai, necessity became innovation. After undergoing surgery last year, she created a one-sided mastectomy bra that provides comfort and dignity to women on the same journey.
“I thought I was going to die,” Carole said through tears. Now, through her Sista Luv Foundation, she is giving back, offering post-surgery care kits and emotional support to fellow survivors.
In Lae, agronomist Nicholar Boas is tackling lifestyle diseases with a vivid twist — a vibrant blue herbal salt made from butterfly pea flowers. Her product, rich in antioxidants, helps regulate blood pressure and blood sugar. With support from CPL Group, Nicholar’s salt may soon appear on supermarket shelves.
In Port Moresby, Geno Geno is turning waste into wealth. A previous winner, she returns with a mulch made from discarded betelnut husks — a product that not only helps plants thrive but also creates income for unemployed youth and supports environmental clean-up in the capital.
Out of 150 entries, the three were chosen by a panel of 11 judges. They now receive cash prizes, business support packages, mentoring, and national exposure. All finalists, including seven flown in from around PNG, participated in a business workshop funded by the PNGAus Partnership, backed by MiBank and Women’s MicroBank.
Each story is an incredible testament to the power of purpose. Whether healing scars, protecting the planet, or preserving health, these entrepreneurs are proving that PNG’s future can be homemade and heartmade.
The overall winner of the competition will be announced in the next edition of Lily Magazine, with additional prizes up for grabs. But for now, these three innovators are already champions — not just in business, but in spirit."

BCFW Forum discuss employment conditions,14/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4423,"Business Coalition For Women/ (BCFW), in collaboration with the EU’s Investment Climate Report /(ICR) Facility, organized an Informative Breakfast for stakeholders in Port Moresby yesterday 13th May 2025
With the theme, “Advancing Inclusive Labour Policies: a Path to Gender Equality in Employment and Business Growth in PNG,” the forum seeks to address the urgent need for reform in Papua New Guinea’s Employment Act, focusing on the introduction of adequate paid maternity leave, the incorporation of paid paternity leave and the elimination of discriminatory clauses that restrict women’s full participation in the workforce.
The Information Breakfast was a combined effort of the BCFW and the Inclusive Labour Reform (ICR). The ICR Facility is currently supporting BCFW in effectively engaging with policymakers and lawmakers to develop gender-sensitive business environment reforms with a particular focus on revising Chapter 373 of the Employment Act 1978.
“We are here to discuss the removal of discriminatory provisions in the Employment Act. We want to see maternity leave included up to 14 weeks. We want to see the removal of discriminatory provisions of dismissal of pregnant mothers who’d been employed for less than 90 days. So today has culminated after several research reports identifying that we do need to focus on care policy provisions and specific inclusions in the Employment Act 1978 to ensure it is up to date,” Kennedy explained.
Elizabeth Asigau, Manager, Survivor Advocacy & Support Services, informed the forum on some of BSP’s responses for its workforce across all its markets, in terms of Gender Equality and Social Inclusiveness.
“One of the links identified is that economic dependence can increase the vulnerability. Many of the victims or we’ll use the term interchangeably, or survivors, rely very heavily financially on the abuser or the abusive partner,” Asigau said.
Kennedy said BCFW was supported by the LCR last year, they employed two key pieces of research: one was employees’ supported childcare, and the other was the labour market survey they did nationwide with over 2000 participants, both men and women from all regions.
“Within the research, it identified there were some significant barriers for both men and women, either in entering the workforce or being retained in the workforce. We had to start focusing on ‘Care Policy Provisions' and start focusing on …so we know when we’re looking at these legislative reforms, we need to be considerate of safeguarding as well,” said Kennedy"
"Osborne, an asset",13/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4418,"On Monday, 12th May, when the Department of Health held a handover-takeover ceremony for the former secretary, it was deemed very special as it not only got the attention of the Minister for Health but also the Prime Minister as well.
Prime Minister James Marape took the stage and announced that the decision to change Dr. Osborne Liko from his current position was not a disciplinary action nor a decision made with malice, but rather it was for a greater calling.
Dr. Liko has been given the role of special advisor on health to the Prime Minister and the government. He will be giving advice on several important policies that have been formulated during his tenure as the health secretary.
PM Marape said Dr. Liko is a one-of-a-kind in his specialist knowledge, skills and talents and this must be preserved and passed on to the younger generation and into the future so he has to be relieved from stressful duties as the secretary of a sluggish department.
In addressing Dr. Liko and his family support, Prime Minister Marape said he was a wonderful role model, which was reflected by the turnout at his farewell event.
Marape applauded Dr. Liko’s attitude of gracefully accepting the NEC decision not to renew his tenure as the Secretary for Health, without any resistance and urged the younger generation of leaders to develop such attitudes in their leadership pursuits.
“I want to say to all of you, a wonderful example to many of you Papua New Guineans, who are aspiring for leadership at all levels, that when one chapter of your life closes you must have the humility and grace …to move onto another sector at our nation’s 50th anniversary coming up Dr. Liko has shown to all of us that when it’s time to move on, you move on and country first must come in.”
“I want to confess that he is moving on, not because he has performed poorly, but rather because of his exceptional. For me as someone who has great respect for him, I don’t go to any other handover-takeover unnecessarily, I go when it matters most,” said Marape.
“He is our country’s best nephrologist, he is one of our country’s best urologists. I need him to be alive in the next 20 years in our country.”"

Polio detected in Lae,13/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4412,"Poliovirus has been detected in Lae Morobe Province through an environmental analysis of wastewater.
The Department of Health emphasizes they are aware of the public reports regarding the detection of poliovirus and states that there are no clinical cases.
Health Minister Elias Kapavore, supported by newly appointed Acting Health Secretary Dr Ken Wai and National Department of Health’s (NDOH) executive manager of Strategic Division, Dr Daoni Esorom, in a press conference today, announced the detection.
Minister Kapavore announced that he will be presenting a submission to the National Executive Council (NEC) and advising the Prime Minister on this detection brought to the department’s attention by the World Health Organization (WHO) from environmental samples they collected. He said NDOH is working closely with WHO and DFAT to address this matter.
The detection of the poliovirus is attributed to the severely low immunization coverage across the country, with Minister Kapavore stating that WHO standards require 90 per cent coverage, while PNG’s coverage is approximately below 50 percent.
He said, “That is a serious concern to us as a department. With the coverage of less than 50 percent, (it) is a risk to our people, (it) is a risk to our country.”
The Minister highlighted that Lae and Madang provinces have a low immunization coverage of approximately 30 percent.
Dr Ken stated that vaccinations are important for children under five years old, emphasizing, “We are not running out of vaccines. The government is providing those vaccines free of charge. It is the right of every child to be vaccinated. Mothers and fathers have a responsibility to take every child to the clinics.”
Meanwhile, Dr Daoni Esorom provided further clarity, stating that although the virus has been detected, “There are no clinical cases as yet.”
He added, “The reasons why we are highlighting this is because of our low immunization coverage, our vaccinable population of 0-5 are at risk. Before we have a widespread outbreak, we need to come in and intervene to encourage mothers, fathers, caregivers to come in and vaccinate your child. That’s the only way to prevent polio.
“The complications of polio can be severe, can be lifelong, but it also leads to disability and paralysis. Sometimes kids will eventually die, and the only prevention for polio and to control polio is through immunization.
NDOH is reassuring the public that the situation is being carefully assessed in close collaboration with NDOH partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and the Australian Government.
“Our immediate priority is to review all available information, strengthen surveillance and ensure that any necessary public health measures are prepared and ready to be implemented. The department is committed to keeping the public informed and will share further updates through official government channels as soon as more information becomes available. In the meantime, we ask everyone to rely on official sources for accurate updates and avoid the spread of unverified information.”
Dr Esorom says the poliovirus detected is identified as ‘Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Type 2 (cVDPV2).
Although PNG was officially declared free of wild poliovirus in 2000, along with the rest of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Western Pacific Region, in June 2018, the country experienced a resurgence of polio due to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1), marking the first outbreak in 18 years.
This outbreak prompted immediate response measures, including nationwide vaccination campaigns and enhanced surveillance efforts. By the end of 2018, over 3 million children had been vaccinated, and the outbreak was declared under control.
As of now, PNG remains classified as ""no longer infected but vulnerable to re-infection"" under the International Health Regulations. This status underscores the ongoing need for vigilance and immunization efforts to prevent future outbreaks."

He said the suspect is now detained at Boroko Metropolitan Cell and will appear in court when his court files are ready."

Two arrested in Madang supermarket assault,12/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4397,"Two prime suspects have been arrested and detained at the Jomba Police Station in Madang for assaulting a mother and her 13-year-old daughter at a Madang supermarket for allegedly shoplifting last Saturday.
The video of the mother and daughter being beaten by security personnel went viral, sparking national outrage. The Police department was tagged and called for swift justice, which aided law enforcement in tracking down the suspects and their location.
The arrests of the suspects were made at Laiwaden Oval earlier today. The victim, Josephine Kadignam, 45, verified that the assault occurred inside the Yaho Supermarket warehouse.
Madang Provincial Police Commander, Chief Inspector Robert Baim, in a public update, said the shop had been located and the identified persons of interest were being pursued. Officers are now preparing formal investigations.
Formal charges of assault occasioning bodily harm and unlawful detention have been laid under PNG’s Criminal Code.
PPC Baim said investigations are ongoing and pledged to release a comprehensive media brief once further progress is made. A press conference will be held on Tuesday, May 13th, to further elaborate on the handing down of charges and possibly a court proceeding date.
Issue on the ground is tense as talks of protests unravel, police is on high alert to counter opportunists.
“We wish to inform the public that police have already identified the shop and the individuals involved. However, investigations must follow all legal procedures before arrests are made. This is to ensure that the case can proceed successfully before the courts. If proper legal processes are not met, we risk losing the case due to technicalities.
“The video is a key piece of evidence, but it must be supported by eyewitness statements to give it full legal strength. Therefore, we are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward and provide a formal statement. Your cooperation is important in helping us secure justice,” PPC Baim expressed.
Furthermore, PPC Baim asks the public to remain calm and allow police to do their job. Stating that public interference or misinformation on social media does not help, and may compromise the case."

Flooding forces suspension of classes,12/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4392,"Flooding at the Zifasing Junior High School, in Morobe’s Huon Gulf district, has forced the indefinite suspension of classes.
The learning of 439 students has been affected following heavy rains and the subsequent flooding of the school area.
Principal Raj Paskal told this newsroom that while classes have been suspended, depending on the weather, their 183 Grade 10 students will have to return on Thursday, May 15th, to start preparing themselves for their Written Expression examination on Thursday, June 5th.
Principal Paskal and the board of governors have written to Morobe’s provincial program advisor, Keith Tangui, expressing concern for the recurring problem that has damaged school infrastructure and severely affected the safety and wellbeing of students and teachers.
Paskal said from 2022-2024, they have witnessed numerous instances of flooding, especially when the notorious Rumu River overflows.
“Last year, Governor Luther Wenge and provincial administrator, Max Bruten, were on ground during a school event and saw for themselves the damages caused by flooding,” said Paskal.
“There, the governor promised to build a brick wall to prevent the floodwaters from inundating the school. However, the provincial government is yet to honour its commitment.
“The buildings of early childhood, primary and high school have water damages to the walls, ceilings, furniture, textbooks and school equipment.
“Dirty floodwaters are in classrooms and have covered access roads, rendering them unusable.”
The board is calling on the provincial and district government to support them by building flood resistant infrastructure, implement an effective disaster management system and reroute Rumu River, to ensure it flows directly under the Zifasing bridge."
Citizens urged to report crime,12/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4387,"The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is urging Papua New Guineans to report crime without fear or favour.
Deputy Commissioner for Operations Daniel Baulch says there are platforms that the public can utilize to lodge their complaints, and one platform is through the website.
He said the complaint raised must be of significant value for ICAC to act on.
“We are aware that people are scared to walk into ICAC’s office and make a complaint, don’t let that stop you from reaching out electronically, or whatever medium that is available to make your complaint, we will act as soon as we see a complaint.
“Those who are brave enough to speak up and report corruption will be protected. These are people who will be recognized as champions.
He further highlighted the importance of effective partnerships between law and justice sector agencies to help ICAC perform its mandated duties.
Baulch said funding continues to be an obstacle they face, which hinders their progress in making more arrests. However, they will not stop ICAC from performing its mandated duties.
ICAC is the anti-corruption agency in Papua New Guinea, established under Section 220B of the Constitution of the independent State of Papua New Guinea and is governed by the Organic Law on the Independent Commission Against Corruption 2020.
The ICAC’s mandated responsibility is to help PNG prevent and combat corrupt conduct by public officials, systemic corrupt conduct within public bodies, and corruption by private individuals who may be in receipt of government funds or may have influenced or encouraged corrupt conduct."

Balob Teachers College has trained over 10,000 teachers in the past six decades and continues to grow in strength and impact, now offering a three-year diploma programme to students from all regions on this nation.
In marking this milestone, Prime Minister James Marape congratulated the College’s founding principal and Australian educator Fred Stolz, for his contribution and commended the institution for reaching a remarkable 60 years.
Mr Stolz, an Australian educator who first came to Papua New Guinea in 1965, returned to Lae last Thursday (May 8) for the anniversary celebrations, where he delivered an emotional speech that deeply moved the audience. In his address, he reflected on the college’s early beginnings, its pioneering role in teacher training, and its evolution into one of Papua New Guinea’s most important educational institutions.
“On behalf of the people and Government of Papua New Guinea, thank Mr Stolz for his visionary leadership and service to our country,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“His dedication to education laid the foundation for thousands of Papua New Guinean teachers who have gone on to serve in every province of our nation. Mr Stolz is a true friend of PNG, and his legacy will live on in the generations of students shaped by Balob.”
The Prime Minister commended the Lutheran Church and the Government of Germany, who were instrumental in establishing the college through significant financial and staffing support. He highlighted the college’s inclusive growth over the decades, noting its transformation into a vibrant, multi-denominational institution serving all parts of the country.
“Balob Teachers College represents the very best of development partnership,” the Prime Minister said. “It began with a bold vision, backed by international support and driven by dedicated educators. Today, it stands as a national pillar of teacher training and a testament to what we can achieve when we invest in education.”
The Prime Minister congratulated Balob’s leadership, staff, students, and alumni for their enduring contribution to nation-building, and for upholding the college’s motto to serve with distinction.
“As Papua New Guinea marks 50 years of Independence this year, institutions like Balob remind us of the strong foundations upon which our country has grown,” Prime Minister Marape said. “I encourage all educational institutions to emulate Balob’s spirit of service, excellence, and unity.”
Mr Stolz concluded his anniversary remarks by saying that coming to Papua New Guinea in 1965 was the best decision of his life — a decision, he said, that changed him for the better and deepened his respect for the resilience and warmth of the PNG people.
“Mr Stolz’s words touched us all. His humility, wisdom, and enduring love for our people are gifts that we cherish,” said Prime Minister Marape. “We are proud to honour him today and celebrate the institution he helped to build.”"

Recruit dedicates certificate to late daughter,10/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4371,"One of the six female firefighter recruits who passed out yesterday dedicated her success to her late daughter, whom she lost to cancer in 2022.
Devina Harigwo, who hails from the Sepik said she left her previous job with Corps Security to take care of her daughter but her world shattered when she lost her only child in 2022.
“I graduated with a certificate in Human Resource at IBS and with that certificate I applied to Corps Security.

For two years, Devina stayed home still mourning her daughter and contemplating on life when she saw an advertisement from the PNG Fire Service, calling for applications to join the service.
“It’s through God’s grace, I am here today. He gave me the courage and confidence to look at the positive from the struggle I went through. I lost my daughter and I wanted to find a way to serve others and protect others to give me peace.
“I believe my daughter is so happy to see me help others and serve others with what I have, with love respect, dignity and pride.”
Furthermore, she made a call to women out there to be courageous and aim for anything they want to be.
“To all the females out there, you can work in a man’s field. It’s just your determination that can push you and as long as you believe in yourself you can go beyond your limitations.
Devina congratulated her cohort and the fellow women that made it through the many processes and tough trainings to be where they are now, official firefighters of the country."
PNG Strengthens Global Presence with New Mission in Geneva,10/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4369,"Papua New Guinea now has full diplomatic representation in Geneva following the official opening of the Permanent Mission of Papua New Guinea to the United Nations, World Trade Organization (WTO) and Other International Organizations in Geneva, Switzerland on Thursday 8 May 2025 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Justin Tkatchenko.
The opening of the Mission comes at a milestone year for the country as it prepares to commemorate its 50th independence anniversary.
This momentous occasion was witnessed by diplomats from the Commonwealth Delegation, Pacific Islands and other Small Island States, Papua New Guinea's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York, Ambassador Fred Sarufa, and senior officials from the Ministry and Department of Foreign Affairs.
In his opening remarks, the Minister acknowledged and thanked the Government of Switzerland for its support on the establishment of the Mission and its operations in the next few years.
The Minister also recognized the support extended by the United Nations and the Commonwealth Secretariat.
He also mentioned that, ""we also believe that the Mission in Geneva will enhance coordination among bilateral and multilateral partners, who are dedicated to the development of Papua New Guinea."" Minister Tkatchenko concluded that he was confident that ""with the opening of the Mission, we can expect increased people-to-people ties; regular exchanges amongst our businesses to explore opportunities as well as increased cooperation areas such as technology and innovation; education and training, research development and downstream processing.""
He outlined that the opening of this Mission in Geneva illustrates the Government's firm commitment to establish Missions in selected strategic locations to promote and secure PNG's interests with different countries and organizations.
“The opening of the PNG Mission in Geneva heralds a new era in our diplomatic engagement with the United Nations and the other international organizations in Geneva as well as a renewed and more focused impetus in our bilateral relations with Switzerland that was established in 1976,” the Minister said.
He further stated that the presence of the Mission in Geneva would enhance the country's engagement with the United Nations, especially its current interface in key issues including human rights, health, and intellectual property matters.

Minister Maru Demands Immediate Review of Import Tariffs,10/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4367,"Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru is calling for an immediate review of import tariffs to give protection to local industries who are struggling to compete against cheap and dumped imports.
Minister Maru expressed dissatisfaction with the current way tariff policy is being administered, which he described as being done “unilaterally, discriminatorily and arbitrarily.”
The Minister explained that the Tariff Reduction Program (TRP) was an externally imposed condition under the broader structural adjustment program, which began in 1999.
“The tariff reduction program was agreed to be implemented with the view to encourage economic efficiency and boost productivity. Lowering tariffs was also seen as a way to encourage a competitive private sector by gradually exposing them to foreign competition. Under the tariff review program, almost 80 percent of import tariffs have been liberalized with protective rates being progressively reduced.”
Minister Maru queried the economic benefits promised under the tariff reduction program.
“Papua New Guinea’s economic structure remains largely unchanged since the implementation of the program. Local manufacturing accounts for only 3 to 6% of GDP with the country continuing to be heavily dependent on exports of raw commodities and imports of goods and services that can be locally produced and manufacturing companies have remained stagnant over the years with not much growth.”
Minister Maru explained that some countries and foreign businesses have been engaged in unfair trade practices using subsidies to gain competitive advantages over highly vulnerable countries like Papua New Guinea (PNG) which are currently not equipped with the legislative and technical capacity to respond to cheap, dumped imports according to agreed international procedures of the World Trade Organization.
“PNG’s production costs are higher than most of our trading partners, and without the use of government sponsored subsidies, their products would not be as competitive in international markets. These cheap dumped goods are then imported into PNG and sold at lower-than-normal market prices posing steep competition for local manufacturers who are forced to scale down operations just to survive or even in some cases, close operations. Tariffs are, therefore, an important trade policy instrument that can address unfair trade practices,” said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru further highlighted that other countries have successfully leveraged tariffs as a negotiating tool to encourage investment into their local manufacturing industries rather than use them for fiscal purposes only.
“With most of PNG’s tariffs already zero rated, and any remaining protective tariffs envisaged to be progressively reduced under any future tariff reduction program, PNG is essentially giving away its bargaining chips when it comes to negotiating future free trade and investment deals. Through the tariff reduction program, PNG has allowed countries to freely access our markets with nothing in return.”
Minister Maru also questioned why key agencies responsible for trade and investment were left out in final decisions on tariff setting.
Minister Maru further stated, “The global trading economy is also undergoing substantial transformation driven largely by advancements in digital technology and rising geo-political tensions, PNG’s national tariff policy should therefore respond to the new realities of conducting commerce in a changing trading environment. Therefore, I am calling for an immediate and complete review of the tariff reduction program with an emphasis on inclusive and comprehensive stakeholder engagement.”
Minister Maru has directed the National Trade Office, with support from the Department of International Trade and Investment, to work with the Department of Treasury and establish a Tariff Working Group which should include agencies responsible for trade and investment, as well as private sector and the broader business trading community.
“This Group will look into strategies in which PNG’s Tariff policy can contribute to attracting investments as well as growing the domestic manufacturing sector and future trade arrangements,” said Minister Maru."

Yafai’s no case submission rejected,09/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4349,"Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika has ruled against the no case submission by Jacob Yafai, citing enough evidence to prosecute the substantive matter in the ongoing trial.
Salika ruled that the court cannot rule on the submission because the defense is yet to present his witness. What is before the court is evidence from the state witnesses only.
“The court is not required to weigh any evidence at the close of state evidence. The weighing of the evidence is usually done after the prosecution and when the defence put in their evidence.  This court has not reached that stage of weighing both evidence yet,” he said.
Salika therefore said the matter will proceed with a date set on June 2nd for the trial to continue.
Yafai, 43, the former deputy finance secretary, from East Sepik's Karapia village in Yangoru-Saussia, was charged with four counts each of official corruption, abuse of office, conspiracy to defraud and misappropriation of four cheque payments worth K41.8 million made to Paul Paraka Lawyers between 2012 and 2013."

Today, he met with Prime Minister James Marape and presented his letter of introduction.
McDonald is a senior career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and was most recently the High Commissioner to Fiji. He takes over from John Feakes, who worked eight years in PNG across three diplomatic postings.
McDonald has had a previous posting as Australia's High Commissioner to New Zealand with accreditation to the Cook Islands and Niue.

Madang police increase efforts to combat highway robberies,08/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4337,"Madang police are actively working to address the rising incidents of highway robberies along key transportation routes.
Provincial Police Commander of Madang Province, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim emphasized that police are exploring a variety of tactical approaches to better secure the highway corridors. These include deploying additional officers to critical zones, such as the Naru section of the highway, and increasing patrol frequency along stretches between Usino junction and Naru areas identifies as hotspots for criminal activity.
“Our officers are conducting regular patrols at designated checkpoints and key spots along the highway. We are also planning to bolster our presence at the quarantine check-point at Mano, which is a strategic point for monitoring and preventing criminal movement,” Baim stated.
We are also considering the use of technology, such as surveillance cameras and increased communication systems, to monitor activity more effectively.
However, Acting Superintendent Baim acknowledged that resource limitations remain a significant hurdle, urging community cooperation as an essential component in the fight against crime.
Community involvement is vital in the ongoing efforts to curb highway robberies. Calling on residents to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity or incidents immediately. Baim highlighted that many criminals are using mobile phones to coordinate their attacks, watching police movements, and warning each other when patrols or patrol vehicles are in sight.
“Criminals are exploiting modern communication tools to evade detection. They monitor police movements and warn each other, which makes it challenging to catch them in the act. We need the community’s help to break this cycle,” Baim explained.
He urged communities to foster a culture of cooperation and transparency.
“Most of the people in these communities hold valuable information that can help us apprehend the suspects. We appeal to residents to come forward and report any suspicious activity doing so could make a difference in saving lives and properties,” Baim further stated.
Despite ongoing efforts, the PPC acknowledged that apprehending and prosecuting suspects remains a complex process.
“It takes time to gather enough evidence, especially if the criminals are not caught during the crime. Proving their involvement in court can be difficult without concrete evidence or witnesses,” he said.
He further expressed concerns about community members who benefit from these illegal activities and do not cooperate with police to enforce law and order.
“Some individuals are profiting from stolen items, and that undermines our collective efforts to establish law and order. We urge community members to resist involvement in criminal activities and to support police investigations,” Baim further expressed.
PPC Baim reiterated his call for the public to remain alert and proactive in reporting any sightings or suspicious activities or individuals acting suspiciously along the highway.
Victims of robbery or attack are encouraged to report incidents to the nearest police station immediately, providing detailed information to aid investigations.
“Every report counts. While it may take time to apprehend the criminals, our commitment remains a challenge unless and until people corporate with us to help combat highway robberies.
Police witness must come forward with providing witness statements in order to convict an offender, you cannot just report incidences and leave it to police to complete the process. He appealed to victims to help police by providing their statements and to appear in court to fully complete the investigation processes."

Iguan disappointed with Morobe govt,08/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4335,"Member for Markham and Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Koni Iguan, voiced his disappointment with the Morobe Provincial Government for launching projects in his electorate without his knowledge.
Eight ambitious projects were launched by the Morobe Provincial Government and administration on Tuesday, May 6th, at Watarais, in Markham district.
In attendance was Morobe Governor, Luther Wenge, provincial administrator, Max Bruten, Deputy Provincial Administrator – Infrastructure, Kissu Lucas, representatives of telecommunication and ICT companies, and other stakeholders.
The eight projects, initiated by Governor Wenge, include an ICT tower and E-library project – where 20 ICT towers will be constructed across the province, a Watarais Regional Growth Centre or township, and K92 mine royalties recognition for Watarais landowners.
A composed Markham MP and Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Koni Iguan, who was slotted into the program, told the guests and locals that he had nothing much to say as he was not consulted about the major projects that would be in his electorate.
“I will not speak much on the matter today,” said Iguan. “Why I am saying this is because all these projects that we are here for now, I was only made aware of them last night. I must be honest.
“Honourable governor, I welcome development in Markham. Remember when I came to Tutumang recently, I told you that I am interested in your plans for Markham because I have not sighted anything in the provincial budget. I was frank in my statement, which some of you might have read or seen on the news.”
Iguan was referring to the budget breakup session at Tutumang on Monday, February 24th, 2025, where he voiced his dissatisfaction after Wenge had presented an expenditure budget of K723.96 million for this year.
Iguan said he was planning on inviting the governor and his provincial administration to attend a DDA meeting, and outline their plans for Markham. However, before that could eventuate, he was notified of the multi-project launch.
The Markham MP told the governor and his delegation that if they see a lack of cooperation from the Markham DDA, that would mean they have no idea of what is going on.
To show his disappointment, Iguan did not touch the spade, nor dig the soil, to symbolise the groundbreaking of the projects in his electorate.
Meantime, in response, Governor Wenge told his administration that in future, local MPs need to be consulted about projects in their respective electorates.
Deputy Provincial Administrator – Infrastructure, Kissu Lucas, agreed that communication with the local MPs is critical, adding they will write to each DDA to support the provincial government’s ICT tower project with K1 million each.
The towers come under “Hello Hello” Project Discovery; a landmark initiative set to revolutionise digital connectivity across Morobe."

PPC Rubiang made this call following social media posts on Facebook that were forwarded to him regarding four sorcery accusation-related cases.
According to him, his office has not received any information. He stated that the Facebook posts claimed that four cases of this nature were reported, including a woman who was burnt in her small hut at Gumine, a woman and her son who were chopped in Kerowagi, a young man in Gumine who was brutally murdered and thrown into a toilet pit, and another report of a woman who was tortured and thrown alive into a toilet pit, claiming that the police and Tribal Foundation are working on addressing it.
""My office had not received anything regarding this posted on Facebook, so it might be false. So far, Simbu province is quiet, and if such incidents are happening in remote parts of the province, people must report them to the police so we can seek help from our leaders to assist the victim,"" PPC Rubiang said.
He urged Simbu police officers and government officials to work collaboratively with his office to disseminate vital information to responsible authorities so that they can act swiftly if and when a crime occurs.
He also warned peddlers of false news they will be investigated and charged accordingly if caught by the police. He said such reports tarnish the name of the province and restrict the movement of people and tourists into the province."

The K100 million-plus project is being jointly funded by the Australian Government, New Zealand Government, and Lae City Authority (LCA), and is being implemented under Australia’s Economic and Social Infrastructure Program (ESIP).
It will be built to the highest possible standards to ensure resilience to earthquakes.

He said the Lae Market plays a crucial role as an economic hub for families, small-scale producers, and informal vendors from across Morobe and beyond.
“For many people in Morobe and surrounding provinces, the Lae Market is their entry point into the economy. This redevelopment will make that entry point safer, more accessible and more dignified,” Mr Kanowski said.

Teachers’ welfare discussed,07/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4323,"The agenda of teachers’ welfare was discussed in a recent board and head teachers' induction in New Ireland Province.
Primary school head teachers, board of management and teachers-in-charge of elementary schools, from Djaul Island, shared their challenges and experiences during the induction.
The training, which ran from Wednesday, April 30th, to Friday, May 2nd, was facilitated by Lavongai LLG school inspector, John Loga, and attended by participants from the primary schools of Djaul, Lapai, Sumuna, Kakapan and Leon, and their feeder elementary schools and board members.
Lapai Primary School’s head teacher, Polos Stanley, drew attention to the nationwide issue of shortage in teachers’ accommodation, outlining that community support is needed to ensure the completion of school projects.
“We have two teachers who are yet to come,” Stanley shared. “The reason behind their delay is accommodation.
“We went to the education office and were advised that teachers refuse to get posted if they will be forced to live in the village.
“We have our projects but we seriously need the community to rally behind the board of management and school administration to see the completion of teachers’ houses. However, we understand that we do not have the numbers, but Parents and Citizens Association does. The people are behind them. So, I’m happy that the boards are here, head teachers are here so that board of management, you are aware that if we, head teachers, do things on our own accord, our schools will be closed.”
Grace Lomba, from Piliva village and representing Djaul elementary teachers-in-charge, elaborated on the need for induction every three years, which is equivalent to one term for the school board membership.
“Board of management changes every three years, and when the new ones are appointed, they have no idea of what is expected,” Lomba stated. “And also, when head teachers keep changing, they will not be informed of their roles and responsibilities. Hence, I agree with the suggestion that a committee should be formed to conduct awareness. This way, people will be informed.”
The two-day training covered financial management, Board of Management roles and responsibilities, head teacher’s checklist, human resource policy and national standard for schools, teachers and students.
Host of the training venue, Djaul Primary School head teacher, Maris Kombeng, said the induction was organised by the schools in collaboration with the office of the school inspector as part of their capacity building program.
He thanked the facilitator for outlining the responsibilities of the head teachers and board members, their structure, general standard operating procedures and the correct channel of reporting."
ICAC raises concern over underreporting of corruption cases,07/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4320,"The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is concerned that despite public reports of potential corruption by high-ranking government officials, they have not received any official complaint about these incidents.
ICAC’s Deputy Commissioner Operations Daniel Baulch  said in the last fortnight, there were publicly reported incidents regarding potential corruption by high-ranking government members and politicians. This includes a letter allegedly from the Minister for Finance, instructing the release of approximately K73 million in outstanding payments to multiple businesses. Days later, one of the dailies reported that the Prime Minister had intervened to halt those payments in recent days, further leading to the replacement of the Finance Minister.
“Additionally, just last week, media reports revealed that a court determined on the civil standard that the Mining Minister paid bribes in the form of vehicles and cash to influence votes during the election. And yet, despite these stories, no official report of suspected corrupt conduct has been made to ICAC about these matters. Their silence speaks volumes,” he said.
He said part IV Section 45 (1) of the Organic Law on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (OLICAC) requires that all leaders who are subject to the Leadership Code report suspected corrupt conduct to the ICAC. There are those who likely failed in their legal obligation to report. Again, the ICAC is left to proactively chase what others fear to face.
“Let's be clear: corruption in PNG is not just about money- it causes real harm. It keeps people from getting healthcare, education, or jobs. It fuels violence. And in some cases, it even leads to death.
“Despite the claims that ICAC has the laws it needs, repeated requests for legislative cooperation are met with silence. Our letters and requests are often ignored. Meetings don't happen. Court processes are delayed. Even simple things like getting search or arrest warrants can be blocked. For over twelve months, we have submitted frameworks, drafted national responses, and sought high-level coordination to confront PNG's corruption and crime epidemic,” he said.
“We are again asking all leaders in government and public service to work with us, take action. Do your duty. Stand up against corruption,” Baulch added.
ICAC’s Deputy Commissioner Operations Daniel Baulch issued this call during a media conference in Port Moresby today."

PNG Reignites National Anti-Human Trafficking Effort,07/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4316,"Papua New Guinea has taken a significant step forward in revitalizing its national response to Trafficking in Persons (TIP) with the convening of the first National Anti-Human Trafficking Committee (NAHTC) meeting since 2022.
Held on April 10 and 17, 2025, at Lamana Hotel in Port Moresby by the Department of Justice and Attorney General, the two-day meeting marks the first NAHTC gathering since 2022, signaling a renewed momentum in addressing the country’s human trafficking challenges.
While the first session, held on April 10, 2025, served as a crucial reset after a prolonged period without meetings, the second session, on April 17, 2025, focused on finalizing Papua New Guinea's submission of the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, an annual status update on the state of anti-trafficking efforts. Comprising representatives from a range of government entities, the committee meeting was also instrumental in advancing a common understanding on the trafficking situation in Papua New Guinea and supporting a whole-of-government response, laying the foundation for the development of a National Action Plan to systematically address and combat the multifaceted challenges of human trafficking in the country. The renewed focus and structured approach in the meeting underscores Papua New Guinea's commitment to enhancing its TIP response and implementing effective measures to protect vulnerable populations.
Representing DJAG, Josephine Pitmur, Deputy Secretary, acknowledged the strong collaboration among stakeholders and emphasized the need for coordinated action.
“Each organization plays a vital role in this effort,” she said. “We need to strengthen our coordination and understand the specific functions each agency has in addressing trafficking in persons so we can improve our collective response as a country.”
“The Criminal Code Act 1975 has been amended to include provisions on people smuggling and trafficking in persons, a vital step in regulating both domestic and cross-border trafficking. These reforms are a crucial part of strengthening PNG's mechanisms and responses to trafficking,” she said.
Commissioner of Police, David Manning, raised concerns over the limited progress since the last NAHTC meeting.
“We’ve only had one successful trafficking conviction in PNG. There are many more cases — some undetected or unreported. A better-informed society can recognize these crimes and report them. Let’s not wait until it becomes a bigger issue. Let’s act now before we are overwhelmed.”
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also presented key global findings.
Fatiaki, Officer-in-Charge of the UNODC Programme Office in PNG, shared insights from the 2024 Global TIP Report, noting:
“There’s been a 25 percent global increase in detected trafficking victims since pre-pandemic levels, with child victims — particularly girls trafficked for sexual exploitation — rising by 31 percent. Alarmingly, forced labour now surpasses sexual exploitation as the leading form of detected trafficking. This makes it even more critical that we accelerate national and regional action.”
David Arnold, Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), emphasized the broader risks that drive trafficking.
“Human trafficking intersects with wider crises and creates opportunities for exploitation. Strengthening prevention, protection, and prosecution through collective action is essential. IOM commends the Government for reconvening the Committee and remains committed to building a whole-of-society approach to safeguard the most vulnerable.”
Arnold emphasized that completing the TIP report inputs is a critical first step toward shaping a responsive and effective National Action Plan.
“There are many steps ahead, but this momentum is vital, and IOM stands ready to support the Secretariat and all partners moving forward.”
During the meeting, government agencies shared updates on their respective efforts to combat human trafficking. These presentations not only informed the TIP questionnaire responses but also reinforced the collaborative approach PNG is taking to address this pressing issue.
Government agencies represented at the meeting included the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC), Department of Labour and Industrial Relations (DLIR), Office of the Public Prosecutor, Immigration and Citizenship Services Authority (ICSA), National Fisheries Authority, and Papua New Guinea Forest Authority. Also, in attendance were and the Department of Justice and Attorney General, the lead agency, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reaffirming their ongoing commitment to supporting Papua New Guinea’s anti-trafficking efforts through technical assistance and collaboration. The meeting was supported by the IOM’s Development Fund.
With renewed political will and multisectoral engagement, the NAHTC is poised to deliver stronger, coordinated action against trafficking in persons in Papua New Guinea — reaffirming the country’s commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of its most vulnerable."
Eviction notice served on illegal settlers,07/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4313,"The Livestock Development Corporation estimates that close to 1,000 settlers will be evicted from portion 234 at Three-Mile, in Lae.
On Monday, May 5th, 40 eviction notices were delivered to those who were illegally squatting on portion 234.
LDC’s lawyer, Justin Issack, and finance manager, Otto Wangillen, were on ground to ensure all the notices were given to police in Lae, who then served them to the settlers. The notice gives them 60 days to move out of the area.
“Situation on the ground is quiet but tense as slowly word is getting out and around that LDC is reclaiming back the State land as the rightful landowner or legal entity with legitimate title,” confirmed Wangillen.
“The eviction will affect close to 1,000 settlers who are from every parts of PNG and have squatted on the area with second and third generation of people.”
The May 1 notice, signed by LDC Managing Director, Terry Koim, directs settlers to vacate the land by June 30, 2025, or face forced removal.
“All settlers must vacate and remove any unauthorised structures – including homes, trade stores, churches and schools – constructed without LDC’s consent,” Koim said."
Dr Billy launches review into Disaster Emergency Response Mechanism,07/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4310,"Minister for Defence, Dr Billy Joseph has launched the Review into the Disaster Emergency and Response Mechanism last night in Port Moresby.
Dr Billy announced that the National Executive Council approved the Review under NEC Decision number 300/2024 with an intention of establishing a disaster Management mechanism called National Emergency Management Authority (NEMA).
The Government intends to set up NEMA as a long-term strategy aimed at establishing an effective process of managing the impacts of disasters, in which provincial governments, LLGs and the communities should work together to better prepare for, respond to, and recover from naturally occurring and rapid onset events that cause serious disruptions to communities.
The launch of the Review into the Disaster Emergency and Response Mechanism marks a significant step forward in disaster management for the country.
“The establishment of this authority aims to create a comprehensive disaster management framework designed to enhance collaboration among provincial governments, local level governments (LLGs), and communities.
“The primary goal of NEMA is to develop a sustainable, long-term strategy that focuses on effectively managing the impacts of both natural disasters and rapid onset events.”
This initiative highlights the importance of preparedness, response, and recovery processes, ensuring that local communities are better equipped to face disruptions caused by disasters.
Dr Billy said by fostering cooperation and coordinated efforts at various levels of government and engaging communities directly, the authority intends to build resilience and improve overall disaster response capabilities across the nation.
The government has developed the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the establishment of NEMA and engaged a team of eminent experts to review all the existing legislations in relation to addressing disasters and emergencies to ensure the risks of disasters are reduced and managed effectively in the country.
The Review Team will be led by Ray Paul – former Commissioner of Customs and will be assisted by Retired Major General Gilbert Toropo and former Chief of Emergency Medicine at Port Moresby General Hospital Dr. Sam Yockopua.
The review will basically set the stage for the establishment of NEMA which will bring together players in Disaster Response and Management together under one organization for effective prevention, response and management of natural and man-made disasters.
About K5m has been allocated for the set up of NEMA."
Customary Land Song Sparks National Reflection,06/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4303,"A powerful new song and music video celebrating the importance of customary land in Papua New Guinea has been launched by advocacy group ACT NOW! in partnership with Starbox Production, as part of a national campaign to protect and promote the country’s most vital asset.
""We are glad to partner with ACT NOW! to promote this very important message. Music, if utilised well, has the power to create better understanding, raise awareness, and hopefully bring positive changes in our communities,"" said Starbox Band Manager, Willie Sarenga.
In Papua New Guinea, customary land is not just ground underfoot — it is the heart of life, linking the earth and sky, the sea and clouds, the past and the future. It is the source of identity, pride, community, and sustenance, deeply woven into the social and spiritual fabric of every Papua New Guinean.
""Our customary land is where we are born and where we return when we die. It connects us with our ancestors and with those yet to come. It provides us with a sense of place, binds us to our history, and secures our future,"" ACT NOW! stated.
Unlike the Western concept of land as a commodity that can be bought and sold, customary land in PNG carries enormous community, spiritual, environmental, and cultural values. It is held collectively and managed through local customs and laws that have adapted and evolved over generations.
""Customary land is neither mine nor yours but a gift we hold in trust as custodians for past and future generations,"" ACT NOW! emphasised. ""It sustains us physically and spiritually, provides food, shelter, and medicine, and supports our cultures, governance, and social stability.""
Sarenga noted that with PNG marking its 50th year of independence, the timing is right to reflect on the nation’s greatest asset.
""As the country turns 50 this year, it’s important for us to rethink and refocus on the wise management of our natural resources. We are only custodians. We are inspired and look forward to more engagements to promote such important messages.""
The song and music video are now available for free on ACT NOW!'s YouTube channel.

Eastern Highlands Forms Discipline Committee,06/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4302,"Eastern Highlands Province has formally established a Provincial Teacher Discipline Committee.

Albert added that the committee will not only handle teacher misconduct but also oversee student discipline cases referred by schools.
“This committee will oversee discipline across the board. There are serious cases in schools, and obviously, they will be referred here,” he stressed.

PNG Hosts Indo-Pacific Health Security Summit,06/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4299,"A three-day Indo-Pacific Health Security Alliance (IPhsa) Conference was officially opened today in Port Moresby.
Jointly hosted by the United States Indo-Pacific Command, Australian Defence Force, Papua New Guinea Defence Force, and the National Department of Health, the conference aims to strengthen partnerships, counter malign influences, and improve readiness, ultimately contributing to peace, security, and prosperity in a free and resilient Indo-Pacific.
The Indo-Pacific health security alliance plays a critical role in enhancing health security across the Indo-Pacific region by fostering collaboration between civilian and military sectors. Through integrated efforts, the conference helps mitigate global health security threats and strengthen national and regional resilience, and bolsters the capacity of civilian and military entities.
Minister for Health, Elias Kapavore, officially opened the conference, which began today and will end on Thursday.
“Today's event marks an important step forward to ensure that collaboration in the health sector and the military is not only strong but strategic, well-organized, and sustainable.
“PNG joining as host for this program shows that PNG is stepping forward as a regional leader, we are showing that our commitment to health security goes beyond national interest, and we are actively contributing to the health and safety of the entire Indo-Pacific region,” Kapavore said .
Kapavore said the Indo-Pacific Health Security Alliance countries unite together to promote collective action, share vital information, and build stronger partnerships across sectors to face the complex health threats in societies.
He said PNGDF and other defence force entities play critical roles as lead agencies for logistics and operational support, including medical and evacuation support, while the national department of health and affected provincial health authorities lead in the health response, collaboration with multi-sector partnerships ensures effective disaster response and recovery.
He said, despite making efforts in addressing health security issues, PNG continues to face challenges such as manpower and funding, a lack of coordinated disaster response, limited understanding of roles and responsibilities, and limited technology support to provide reliable data, something that needs to be addressed in this meeting."

PM Marape applauds OTML,06/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4294,"Prime Minister James Marape has extended his congratulations to the Board, management, and workforce of Ok Tedi Mining Ltd (OTML) for achieving a record K1.85 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2025, delivering K681 million in net profit after tax.
“This exceptional result is a testament to what Papua New Guineans can accomplish when entrusted with the stewardship of our natural resources,” said Marape.
“Ok Tedi, being 100% nationally owned, embodies our vision of resource nationalism and demonstrates how revenue and profits can flow back to our landowners, provinces, and the national budget.”
The Prime Minister recalled that one of his first provincial visits after taking office in 2019 was to Western Province, where he issued clear policy direction for OTML to extend its mine life and improve operational efficiency.
“I am pleased the management team took our policy direction seriously. The extension of Ok Tedi’s life to 2050 is a direct result of those early decisions. We now see the benefits through increased output and financial returns,” he said.
OTML has projected it will generate over K40 billion in benefits over the next 26 years, which includes dividends, royalties, taxes, and compensation payments.
Prime Minister Marape welcomed these figures, saying they reinforce the strategic importance of OTML to national development.
“This revenue — and more importantly, the profit — is what we can use to build schools, fund hospitals, and support rural development. OTML is truly our flagship mine,” he said.
He also reaffirmed the Government’s support for the ongoing Community Mine Continuation Agreement (CMCA) review, emphasising the importance of securing social licence and ensuring benefits continue to reach landowners and impacted communities.
“The extension of the mine must not come at the cost of our environment or the rights of our people. I am assured that environmental and social standards are being elevated under the current management,” he said.
Looking to the future, Marape reiterated his government’s broader vision to turn the Tabubil-Kiunga corridor into a diversified economic zone through downstream processing, agriculture, training institutions, and renewable energy initiatives.
“In fact, I have directed Kumul Minerals Holdings Ltd (KMHL) to explore establishing a new subsidiary that brings together PNG’s own mining professionals to run mines domestically or export their services abroad. OTML’s performance proves that we can run our own mining enterprises – and do it well.”
He also highlighted the importance of critical infrastructure investment to support OTML’s future operations and open new economic frontiers.
“The Government’s Connect PNG initiative is playing a vital role in de-risking business operations. The new road corridor linking Western Province to the Indonesian border is expected to be completed by the end of this year. We are also opening access from Kiunga to the Aiambak deep-water port and establishing connections to the Highlands Highway. These projects will help safeguard mine operations during dry weather and unlock commercial opportunities for the region,” he stated.
“Such infrastructure not only supports Ok Tedi’s logistics and supply chains, but also strengthens the long-term commercial viability of Western Province as a trade and investment hub.”"
NEC appoints PNG-Indo Trade Commissioner,06/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4292,"The National Executive Council’s (NEC) has approved the appointment of Seline Leo-Lohia as the Trade Commissioner of Papua New Guinea to the Republic of Indonesia.
Prime Minister Marape described this as a “very strategic appointment”.
“Papua New Guinea and Indonesia are close neighbors but are yet to fully explore the possibilities of our cooperation. For the last 49 years our focus has been on border and security talks annually. These have not led to improvement of our border facilities, direct shipping links, creation of jobs, or significant export between our two countries. It is time PNG develops a strong, deep, and robust relationship with Indonesia in realising the potential of both countries in trade and investment, and appointment of Ms. Leo-Lohia is the start of the shift in focus to the commercial dimension of our relationship with Indonesia. Ms. Leo-Lohia will be the direct link between the private sector of our two countries and the PNG-Indonesia Business Council,” said Prime Minister Marape.
Prime Minister further highlighted the need for PNG to partner Indonesia which is the now the world’s fourth most populous nation, the largest economy in Southeast Asia, and the seventh largest in terms of purchasing power parity.
“Indonesia’s economic base has shifted from the primary sector to secondary and tertiary industries and strengthening its position in downstream processing and adding value in manufacturing, trade, and services. The country’s transition from primary production to tertiary production is also aided by the establishment of economic zones. Indonesia now has 118 Industrial Parks, 15 SEZs, 4 Free Trade Zones and 10 Tourism Zones and these economic zones contributed significantly to the government’s policy on downstream processing and value addition of its natural resources.”
“Indonesia is a global player in mining, including the extraction of oil and natural gas being a key contributor to Indonesia’s GDP. Indonesia has ranked among the world’s third largest coal and nickel producers. Downstream processing has been relatively successful- thousands of jobs have been created, higher-value skills have been transferred, and advanced technological and economic processes have been brought to Indonesia. The nickel SEZ alone created 80,000 jobs and 12,000 indirect jobs at Weda Bay - only one SEZ created more jobs than the jobs created by entire PNG mining and petroleum industry”
Prime Minister Marape said, “PNG has immense potential with abundant natural resources in mining, petroleum, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and services for downstream processing value addition respectively. There is no better place to learn from than Indonesia which has already mastered this approach.
“The most valuable lesson PNG can learn from Indonesia is how they have mastered downstream processing and value addition, and how we can implement similar strategies in PNG. We do not have to look far- Indonesia, our closest neighbor has successfully navigated this path and is now a formidable player on the global stage. They are willing to share their experience and expertise, and we must stand ready to learn from them and collaborate with them. With the appointment of our Trade Commissioner, we are also looking at attracting serious Indonesian investment into PNG.”"
SHP men charged with forgery,06/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4291,"Two men from Southern Highlands Province were arrested at Police Headquarters in Konedobu last week for allegedly producing a letter bearing a forged signature of the Police Commissioner.
The fraud was discovered among documents seeking K4.6 million in counterpart funding for the construction of police infrastructure in the Southern Highlands Province.
Police Commissioner, David Manning, commended the RPNGC’s Infrastructure Project Team, led by the Chief of Administration, Deputy Commissioner Philip Mitna, for their diligence in the vetting process that detected the fraud.
“The RPNGC has stringent accountability procedures in place to prevent criminal activities.  The two men, both aged in their 40’s from Southern Highlands Province, were quickly detained and will now be prosecuted.
“They are being charged with one count each of forgery. These are serious offences that carry terms of imprisonment.
“These arrests stand as a further warning to fraudsters attempting to defraud government agencies that you will be caught and arrested.
“Our accountability and oversight mechanisms have been strengthened over recent years, ensuring that attempts by criminals to take advantage of unprecedented Government support is quickly identified and mitigated”
Commissioner Manning said all police infrastructure projects funded by the government through the Special Police Assistance Program (SPAP) are done so in conformance with standard procedures set by the National Procurement Commission.
“Our aim is to ensure that government funds disbursed through SPAP funding are transparently and prudently expended on quality infrastructure.
“This includes construction to address historic underinvestment since Independence. With the assistance of Government through the Special Police Assistance Program, we are now able to invest in that infrastructure that supports frontline police officers.
“This new infrastructure will support our police officers around the country, strengthening law and order outcomes for all communities.”"
Moving projects for Middle Ramu,06/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4290,"The Baiyer-Middle Ramu road resonates strongly with Middle Ramu’s cry for connectivity and accessibility to services.
On Saturday May 03rd, 2025, locals gathered in Ruti Valley to witness the arrival of the two brand new excavators purchased recently by the Middle Ramu District Development Authority (DDA) for road construction. There the Open MP Kansol Kamdaru outlined some of the projects that will be delivered in the coming weeks.
Kamdaru said there has been little tangible development in the district to date. This is obvious with deteriorating public infrastructure built during the precolonial days. The Middle Ramu DDA is backing education and health needs with funding.
For example, a 40% school subsidy has been allocated from the budget for infrastructure projects for 14 schools. The challenge now is transporting the materials which the MP said will be addressed with a freight subsidy from the national government.
On Friday 2nd May and Saturday 3rd May, Minister for Works & Highways met in Mt Hagen his department secretary Gibson Holemba, Middle Ramu MP Kansol Kamdaru, Western Highlands Governor Wai Rapa and Mul-Baiyer MP Jacob Maki, to learn first-hand the progress on the Baiyer-Madang Road.
During the trip, they visited Aiome Secondary School in Middle Ramu, where Governor Rapa and the Mul-Baiyer MP made a K200,000 commitment to the school for a new science lab.
Acknowledging the challenges of Middle Ramu district, MP Kamdaru, as a first-time MP, resolved he would deliver as much as he can for his people before the next election. One of his achievements was the creation of Wanuma Local Level Government. Wanuma LLG is currently running its first LLG election. Kamdaru presented K500, 000 to LLG executives to build a LLG chamber so it could have its first meeting this September."
"PNG, Indonesia to further trade, investment relations",05/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4282,"Preparations are underway for the launch of the Papua New Guinea – Indonesia Business Council Inc.
Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru has confirmed that the PNG–Indonesia Business Council will be launched by Prime Minister James Marape on Wednesday, May 7, at the National Parliament’s State Function Room.
Minister Maru said, “PNG and Indonesia are close neighbours connected by land border, but have not developed the trade and investment relationship between the two countries through any structured formal relationships.
“We are so close, yet so far away in terms of trade and investment. For the last 49 years, our focus has been on border and security talks annually. It is time PNG develops a strong, deep, and robust relationship with Indonesia in realizing the potential of both countries in trade and investment.”
Maru said the launch of the PNG-Indonesia Business Council is the start of the shift in focus to the commercial dimension of our relationship with Indonesia. Their main job is to liaise with the Indonesian private sector to drive trade and investment between the two countries.
He said major foreign direct investments from Indonesia are a priority.
Indonesia is currently the world’s fourth most populous nation, the largest economy in Southeast Asia, and the seventh largest in terms of purchasing power parity.
Indonesia is a global player in mining, including the extraction of oil and natural gas, which is a key contributor to Indonesia’s GDP.
Indonesia has ranked among the world’s third-largest coal and nickel producers. Downstream processing has been relatively successful- thousands of jobs have been created, higher-value skills have been transferred, and advanced technological and economic processes have been brought to Indonesia.
“We do not have a major Indonesian investor in PNG, when they are world leaders in many sectors today. They have a huge market and have many companies that can invest in PNG, but we have never leveraged the closeness of our relationship by learning from their success and bringing their companies to invest in PNG.
“PNG has immense potential with abundant natural resources in mining, petroleum, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and services for downstream processing value addition, respectively. There is no better place to learn from than Indonesia, which has already mastered this approach,” said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru further stated, “Thank you to the friendship of our former and current Prime Minister and the former and current President of Indonesia. They have really set the basis for us to now take our relationship to the next level. It has taken use 50 years to reach a point where we are now able to have a PNG- Indonesia Business Council and we also now have a Ministerial Committee led by the Deputy Prime Minister, Hon. John Rosso, MP. We are now ready to step up in our relationship.”
“We are hoping to secure the first K1.5 billion Indonesian investment in our country in the coming weeks,” added Minister Maru."
Lae trains marching band,05/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4279,"Lae is set to have its own dedicated marching band – a first for any province – following the official opening of the Lae reserve police pipes and drums training this morning at Igam Barracks.
Forty trainees, under the Lae City Authority’s police reserve pipes and drums program, will be undergoing training for five months at Igam Barracks.
The K1.2 million program is facilitated by the LCA Economic Services and Tourism Division in partnership with the Lae reserve program.
LCA chief executive officer, Robin Calistus, said they aim to get the band ready for PNG’s 50th independence anniversary in September 2025.

Marape clarifies court’s decision,05/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4267,"Prime Minister James Marape has responded to questions regarding matters raised in court decisions involving certain political leaders.
Marape clarified that while the court proceedings did refer to the conduct of some individuals, these persons were not principal parties to the case.
“I wish to make it clear that the individuals mentioned were not the primary complainants or defendants in this matter,” he said.
“Their names were raised through inferences made during the court’s deliberation based on evidence adduced, but they were not the principal offenders or parties directly involved.”
He said that the matters were essentially court proceedings in which evidence led to commentary or observations, rather than direct charges against the said leaders.
“These are matters of court inference and commentary, and as such, I do not believe it is appropriate at this point in time to take any specific position on the matters. The court has issued its findings, but we must be careful not to mischaracterize the nature of those findings or elevate them beyond their legal context.”
The Prime Minister urged the media and the public to approach the issue with responsibility, noting that respect for the due process of law and proper legal interpretation must prevail over political commentary or public speculation.
“As a government that upholds the rule of law, we respect the independence of the judiciary. However, it is also important that we do not politicise or misrepresent what are essentially legal interpretations made in proceedings where these leaders were not directly on trial.”
The Prime Minister concluded by affirming his commitment to transparent and accountable governance, while also maintaining fairness and due process in responding to judicial outcomes."

Vipers are among the few formed teams this season, starting on a high note, and this was shown in their match against Waghi Tumbe when they recovered from a six-point deficit to claim a comprehensive win.
Waghi Tumbe led at half time 12-6 and was on track for an upset win. But the inspiration in the sheds came from Vipers' coach, Brendon Gotuno, who motivated his side to win the game.
“During the first half, we made too many errors in the second half, I told the boys that we had to stay disciplined, complete our sets, and play what we trained for. And the boys did that,” said Gotuno.
He added that the Vipers remained disciplined, minimised errors and were rewarded with a win.
The Vipers veteran and team Captain, Gilmore Paul, scored a hat-trick and led his team to a strong win, who was later named player of the match.
Paul said, "" In the second half, our coach told us to polish up our games and do our jobs individually, who will contribute to overall team performance, and we came up with that in the second half and won the game.""
Paul attributed the win to the team’s overall performance and applauded the boys for the strong game.
Tumbe coach, Tony Dai, said it was a fair game. His side couldn't nail a win in the end due to sloppy play, but Dai lauded Vipers for a good match day.

LDC Issues Eviction Notice to 3 Mile Settlers in Lae,05/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4264,"The Livestock Development Corporation Limited (LDC) has issued an official eviction notice to all illegal settlers occupying Portion 234 at 3 Mile, Lae, directing them to vacate the land by June 30, 2025, or face forced removal.
The notice, signed by LDC Managing Director Terry Koim and dated May 1, confirms that Portion 234 is a legally registered State Lease held by LDC.
The public is advised that police will begin serving eviction notices today, Monday, May 5, at the 3 Mile Police Station. Awareness activities were conducted on Sunday, May 5th, to inform residents of the legal grounds and implications.
Importantly, the Certificate of Authorisation to Occupy (CAO) on Portion 234 previously held by DAL was formally transferred to LDC by a decision of the then DAL secretary and senior statesman, Noreo Beangke, in a letter addressed to the Secretary for Lands dated June 19, 1987.
“All settlers must vacate and remove any unauthorised structures—including homes, trade stores, churches and schools—constructed without LDC’s consent,” Mr Koim said.
He explained that following LDC’s closure in Lae in 1994, settlers unlawfully occupied the land and removed staff from the Department of Agriculture and Livestock (DAL) and the National Agriculture Quarantine and Inspection Authority (NAQIA). He reaffirmed that the land has never been disposed of by LDC to any person or entity.
“This land has always remained a government asset under LDC. It is not for private use or occupation,” Mr Koim said.
The eviction directive is supported by legal and administrative authorities:
-	A Prime Ministerial directive dated 17 March 2020, instructing LDC to recover its assets across PNG;
-	A public warning from Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Lands John Rosso stating that illegal settlers on State land face eviction without compensation.
-	A general directive from the Secretary for Lands and Physical Planning warning illegal occupants nationwide;
-	Public notices issued in May 2020 by the DAL Secretary and LDC Board Chairman urging the voluntary evacuation of LDC-owned lands.
“This eviction is part of our ongoing efforts to reclaim vital State properties for future agricultural and livestock development,” Mr Koim said.
“We call on all settlers to comply peacefully. No compensation will be paid as their occupancy is illegal.”
The LDC has already successfully reclaimed State assets in several provinces, including Central, East Sepik, Eastern Highlands, Morobe, Western Highlands, and Madang.
Concerned residents are encouraged to contact LDC’s General Manager Operations, Steven Yangis, on 7290 6709 for further guidance.
The notice was also copied to DPM Rosso, Minister for Livestock Sekie Agisa, Minister for Agriculture John Boito, key departmental secretaries, the Morobe Provincial Police Commander, and legal representatives."

Her father shared with this newsroom how vibrant a young woman his daughter was.
“I tell Jolana’s siblings to stay strong and follow in her footsteps, as she left behind a legacy. My wife and I ensure we provide all the support our children need to better their education.

“I had to gain the strength to come today, my wife and I, our message to parents out there who are going through the same situation is that we have got to move on in life. We have to move on; Jolana’s achievements are our achievements, and we are proud of her.
Although he accepts his late daughter’s death at such a young age, he believes she would have been cured with proper medical care.

But we are strong on ethics, and we teach it as a unit, and students have to pass it, and if they don't, they don't graduate, they come back and do the ethical side of issues.
This also applies to media in general, is something that we hold really important, and so that's one way we try to, in our formation of the students, help them to understand that, yes, there are short cuts you can do things and probably get away with it, but ethically, is that the right way To do things? And we also help our students to understand that the environment around which they live and study is going through this whole problem that we are facing, the development of technology with AI coming in.
This is affecting the environment in which they are working,"" said Matbob.
""We need guidelines in a way people need to know how to communicate using the particular tool, and at the perspective of that in the university level, we are the administration and the practitioners.
""We are looking at having  policies in place in which students in a way perform, and they use that academically,"" continued Dr. Aisoli-Orake.

Marape expressed his gratitude to the Minister for articulating clear reform measures aimed at strengthening grassroots governance and ensuring that the third tier of government is not only functional but truly representative of the people it serves.
“I commend Minister Eoe for his dedication and clarity in outlining the Government’s continued commitment to reforming and empowering the Local-Level Government system,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“These reforms – including putting ward councillors on government payroll, improving candidate eligibility, and strengthening governance at the community level – are all part of our broader vision to take back PNG from the ground up.”
He acknowledged the essential role of LLGs in national development, noting that nearly 80% of the country’s population live and work at the ward and village level.
“If Papua New Guinea is to grow equitably, development must begin in our villages, where the majority of our people live,” he said.
“That is why we continue to invest in building the capacity of our LLGs – because real transformation starts at the grassroots.”
Marape also extended his appreciation to the Electoral Commissioner for their work in preparing and delivering this critical democratic exercise.
Looking ahead, the Prime Minister appealed to all Papua New Guineans to exercise their democratic rights peacefully and responsibly."

The candidates are:
Polling in the court-ordered by-election is set for Saturday, July 12th, and will end on Friday, August 01st, 2025.
Kabwum was one of two districts in Morobe Province that had its political representative declared ‘under special circumstances’ following the violence and destruction of ballot papers and boxes, and public assets, on Sunday, July 17th, 2022.
While Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai, used his powers “under special circumstances” to declare Patrick Basa as the local MP on August 8th, 2022, another candidate, Haring Quoreka, took the matter to court. The national court handed down its decision on May 26, 2023, declaring Basa’s election null and void.
Basa and the Electoral Commission then sought a review at the Supreme Court, which was again quashed on September 24th, 2024 and upheld the National Court decision of May 26, 2023.

TIPNG calls PM to action,02/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4233,"Transparency International Papua New Guinea (TIPNG) in noting the Prime Minister's media statement made after defeating the motion of Vote of No Confidence (VONC), is now urging him to take action against corruption.
Now his tenure is secured for the remaining term of this parliament, TIPNG urged the Prime Minister to to drive forward the reforms that are required to strengthen governance and accountability in Papua New Guinea.
“The time for talk is over. Papua New Guinea’s poor ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) should be a major worry for the PM as it reflects a widespread level of corruption in the public sector and taking serious action to address this should be his immediate priority,” said TIPNG Chair, Peter Aitsi.
TIPNG called on the PM to take the following actions:
1.	Sack Non-Performers: The Prime Minister must sack people who are not-performing, this includes Ministers, Department Secretaries, Commissioners, and CEOs. It is time to send a clear message that incompetence, negligence and non-performance will no longer be tolerated. Seek out persons who are capable, experienced and qualified and recruit them under merit-based system with a focus on individuals who have demonstrated high degrees of integrity in their past roles.
2.	 Press forward with the Electoral Reforms: Be the Champion for the Parliamentary Committee Report Chaired by ESP Governor Allan Bird on Election Reform. Lead the presentation of report to Parliament and focus parliament on agreeing and prioritizing the changes needed in order to safeguard the integrity of the 2027 National Elections, in the short remaining time. Given that PNG is now 18 months away from the 2027 National Elections, TIPNG calls
for a specific focus on the 3 key areas:
a.	Restore Governance in the Electoral Commission: Appointment of additional commissioners, at least 3, who are qualified, experienced and independent of politics.
b.	Commit to transparency: Publish the current Common Roll online and establish a process for citizens to check and if required re-register themselves.
c.	Early and consistent release of funding for the PNG Electoral Commission to support their operations and preparation. If required appoint an external accounting firm to manage on behalf of the Electoral Commission.
3.	Full Implementation of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations: The government needs to take immediate action to implement the Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) recommendations. This is crucial in order for Papua New Guinea to come out of the grey listing.
4.	Enhance public accountability through the enactment of a Right to Information Law and the establishment of robust oversight mechanisms.
5.	Strengthening Integrity Institutions: The government must strengthen and fully resource integrity institutions, including giving full authority and mandate to the National Anti-Corruption Agencies.
6.
Furthermore, TIPNG said the National Anti-Corruption Strategy Task Force must convene regularly to ensure progress on critical anti-corruption initiatives.
“Addressing corruption is fundamental if we are to see continued economic growth and attract foreign direct investment. We acknowledge the Prime Minister’s focus on transforming key sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and fisheries, but these efforts will be wasted if we fail to acknowledge that corruption is the impediment to realizing the full potential of these sectors,” added the TIPNG Chair.
TIPNG says it stands ready to work collaboratively with the government and all stakeholders to advance these critical reforms, saying “he time for action is now!”"
Eoe Urges Responsibility as PNG Holds Long-Awaited LLG Elections,02/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4232,"Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, Soroi Eoe, has thanked the people of Papua New Guinea for exercising patience for eight years during which time LLG elections were delayed.
In highlighting some of the improvements in the election processes made by the government since 1995, and cautioned the public not to interfere with the conduct of election as it can be declared failed.
PNG has a three-tier government system: the National, Provincial and Local Level Government (LLG). All play equally important roles in governing the country.
Therefore, Eoe stressed that the importance of the roles and responsibilities of LLGs cannot be emphasized enough. The LLGs play a vital and significant role because this is where the majority of the people are.
He said is the country is to move forward, it needs to empower and develop the local communities throughout the country, therefore it is important to have a functioning third tier government.
Minister Eoe said the Marape-led government is fully aware of the significant roles of a LLG and has taken important steps to empower and improve both its governance structure and delivery mechanisms.
These include putting Ward Members (Council) and Presidents in the Governments' Pay Roll System, Conduct LLG Elections 30 months after the National General Elections, changing laws to ensure LLGs/ Wards are headed by people with Grade 10, 12, or diploma or degree holders and several others.
Minister Eoe added that it was important for voters to exercise greater responsibility in ensuring that the best people are elected
He is now appealing to every citizen to ensure that the current LLG Election is conducted freely, safely and responsibly."
"School trucks not private vehicles, says MP",01/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4227,"Member for Kokopo Ereman ToBaining Junior has expressed concerns over the increasing number of secondary school students arriving late for classes due to transportation problems.
ToBaining Jnr stated that most secondary schools in in East New Britain Province lack proper coordination of school trucks and other vehicles needed to transport students to and from schools.
He raised the issue while commenting on a notice paper regarding the status of the Early Childhood Education Teachers College, formerly known as Bismarck Teachers College, during the April 24th provincial assembly.
He said school principals and teachers should be fair to their students.
“The trucks that the school has, are not your private vehicles to carry your families around or to only take teachers shopping,” stressed the Kokopo MP.
“Be considerate and pick up students in the morning and coordinate drop-offs in the afternoon.
“If you drive around town, you will witness many students wandering after 9am, most of them waiting for transport to get to school. Some of the affected schools include Warangoi Secondary, George Brown Secondary, and Bitapaka Secondary.”
ToBaining also highlighted the dangerous practice of students hanging onto the back of moving public vehicles.
“This is risky, and sometimes I wonder, where are all the school trucks and vehicles?”
A number of schools in the province were given vehicles by the district and provincial government, but these schools are not sufficiently assisting students with transportation.
The Kokopo MP said he had raised this matter several times during assembly sittings and called on local MPs, the Education Division, and school boards to address the issue urgently.
East New Britain Provincial Member and Chairman of the Provincial Assembly, Michael Marum, echoed similar sentiments, pointing out that many institutions were not utilising the trucks as intended."
U.S. Maritime Investments Boost PNGDF,01/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4226,"The United States of America has officially launched two key infrastructure projects at the Lombrum Naval Base, located in Manus Province, as part of its ongoing commitment to enhancing maritime readiness for the Papua New Guinea Defense Force (PNGDF).
The $16 million investment (approximately 61 million Kina) will fund the construction of the Small Boat Team and Bosun Facility (SBBF) and the Regional Maritime Training Center (RMTC), projects that are slated for completion in April 2026.
On April 29, 2025, U.S. Ambassador to Papua New Guinea Ann Marie Yastishock, accompanied by the PNGDF leadership, provincial officials, and representatives from the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet and Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command (NAVFAC), participated in a ceremonial groundbreaking for the facilities.
These new structures will significantly expand the operational capabilities of Lombrum Naval Base, furthering the long-term security of the Indo-Pacific region.
The Small Boat Team and Bosun Facility will be designed to support PNGDF small boat operations, providing space for three small boat teams, as well as maintenance and storage for maritime equipment. This addition will greatly improve PNGDF's ability to perform coastal operations and respond to maritime threats.
The Regional Maritime Training Center will offer state-of-the-art classrooms and administrative spaces to foster continued technical proficiency and enhance training programs for PNGDF personnel. The facility is part of a broader strategy to build sustainable operational capacity within the PNGDF, ensuring that the force remains prepared for future security challenges.
This investment is a key component of the U.S.–Papua New Guinea Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA), signed in 2023. The partnership underscores USA’s commitment to strengthening defense ties with PNG, promoting regional stability, and fostering long-term collaboration.
“These projects are about more than just infrastructure,” said Ambassador Yastishock during the ceremony. “They represent trust and a shared commitment to protect the democratic values and mutual respect that define our relationship.”"
Farmers Prepare For Climate Change Effects,01/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4225,"As extreme heatwaves and prolonged droughts devastate key agricultural regions across Africa, including staple-producing countries like Nigeria, Papua New Guinea (PNG) stands at a unique advantage with its year-round rainfall and stable tropical climate.
While farmers in Nigeria report massive crop losses due to temperatures soaring beyond 35°C, PNG’s consistent rainfall patterns and moderate temperatures present an opportunity for local growers to increase production and enter markets affected by supply shortages.
With global supply chains disrupted and African agricultural exports declining, PNG farmers are urged to scale up their output, adopt improved practices, and target regional and international markets in need of alternative suppliers.
Koren Maso from the Department of Agriculture and Livestock in a statement said, “what is a disaster for others can be a window of opportunity for PNG.”
He further stated that PNG’s natural climate is suitable for producing many of the crops now under threat globally, such as cocoa, coffee, vegetables, and rice.
There is opportunity in:
-	Exporting fresh produce to Pacific and Southeast Asian markets;
-	Expanding rice and grain production to substitute for imports affected by African shortages
-	Investing in agro-processing for high-value crops like cocoa, vanilla, and coffee
However, he said policy support is key and the National Government, through its Medium Term Development Plan IV and the National Agriculture Strategy Plan (2024–2033), is committed to enabling climate-smart agriculture, expanding access to markets, and ensuring PNG becomes a regional food hub in a changing global climate.
Mr Maso said now is the time for local farmers to think big, plant more, and connect to global value chains."
New Airstrip Lifts Sepik Communities,01/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4224,"More than 19,500 people in the remote Sepik region are celebrating fresh hope and opportunity following the official opening of the rehabilitated Mariama Airstrip on the 28th of April 2025.
For 10 isolated communities in Karawari Rural LLG, East Sepik Province, the restored airstrip is a vital new lifeline — connecting them to health care, schools, and markets that once felt out of reach.
For a vanilla farmer like Daniel Wapi, the impact is personal. “Before, I had to paddle for days to sell my vanilla and get supplies. Now, planes can come. My children can get medicine quickly, and my vanilla reaches better markets,” he said, calling the airstrip ""a blessing for our people.""
Delivered through a partnership between Papua New Guinea’s Rural Airstrip Agency (RAA), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and funded by the European Union’s EU-STREIT PNG Programme, the PGK 807,671.15 rehabilitation transformed the 680-meter runway into an all-weather facility.
Upgrades included stronger surfacing, improved drainage to handle floods, and safety markers for reliable daytime landings.
The significance of the project was highlighted at the inauguration by the Governor of East Sepik Province, Allan Bird.
""My sincere thanks to RAA, DNPM, the UN system, FAO, and especially the European Union for this successful STREIT Project – the largest EU-funded project in the South Pacific for East and West Sepik. This achievement shows that large projects can yield positive results in Papua New Guinea. On behalf of the people of Greater Sepik, thank you, European Union.”
EU Ambassador Jacques Fradin emphasised that efficient transport is crucial for helping Sepik’s vanilla, cocoa, and fish products reach wider markets. Beyond infrastructure, the project created 10,000 person-days of paid work for local men and women, offering much-needed income and new skills.
With local Airstrip Maintenance Officers now trained to sustain the airstrip, families like Wapi’s say Mariama’s reopening is not just about planes landing — it’s about new possibilities taking flight."

This significant initiative is the result of a partnership between the City Pharmacy Limited Foundation Inc. (CPLF) and the Sir Brian Bell Foundation (SBBF), aiming to provide affordable and accessible health services to women across Papua New Guinea.
The clinic, which offers same-day cervical cancer and HPV screenings for just K20, uses the world-class GeneXpert diagnostic system for rapid results. Women who require further treatment will be referred immediately to the Port Moresby General Hospital’s Obstetrics & Gynaecology Clinic.
This initiative is aligned with the national HPV screen-and-treat strategy, endorsed in 2021, which has already proven successful in provinces like Western Highlands, Madang, and New Ireland. The ribbon-cutting ceremony was officiated by Lady Emeline Dadae, marking a historic moment in the fight against cervical cancer in PNG.
Priscillar Napoleon, Project Manager for Her Health Hub, emphasised that this clinic would empower women to take control of their health, removing the barriers that have long prevented many from seeking preventive care.
CPL Group’s Sir Mahesh Patel, who could not attend the event, shared his vision of hope and empowerment, stating that Her Health Hub symbolizes action and a brighter future for women's health in Papua New Guinea.
The new clinic is more than just a health service; it brings hope to women by providing them with the opportunity for early detection and treatment.
In a safe, supportive, and affordable setting, women can now access life-saving services that were previously out of reach for many, empowering them to take charge of their health."
APEC countries urged to demonstrate leadership on climate effects,01/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4219,"Papua New Guinea (PNG) has called on APEC member economies to demonstrate bold and inclusive climate leadership, not only by reducing emissions but also by scaling up support for adaptation, including technology transfer and climate finance.
The theme for this year’s APEC Ocen-Related Ministerial Meeting, “Navigating Our Blue Future: Connection, Innovation, and Prosperity”, resonates deeply with PNG’s national development goals and aligns with the broader vision outlined in the 2050 Blue Pacific Strategy.
Speaking at the meeting in Busan, South Korea, Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources, Jelta Wong, emphasized the urgent need for collective action as Pacific Island nations face the frontlines of climate impacts.
Minister Wong urged APEC economies to show leadership by going beyond mitigation efforts to include robust support for climate adaptation, technology transfer, and targeted climate finance.
“We are already witnessing rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and increasingly frequent extreme weather events that threaten our coastal communities and marine ecosystems,” Minister Wong stated. “We call on all APEC economies to pair mitigation efforts with substantial adaptation support. The time to act decisively is now.”
Minister Wong welcomed the Busan Ocean Declaration 2025, noting its alignment with Papua New Guinea’s national development goals and the broader aspirations of the 2050 Blue Pacific Strategy. He expressed PNG’s strong support for regional action that fosters innovation, prosperity, and effective ocean governance.
He reaffirmed Papua New Guinea’s commitment to the Busan Ocean Declaration 2025 and outlined the country’s vision for the blue economy, emphasizing a balance between economic development, ocean health, cultural heritage, and community resilience.
“Our ocean is central to our identity and prosperity,” Minister Wong said.
“Our blue economy model reflects this interconnectedness, and our policies must ensure that economic growth does not come at the cost of ecosystem degradation.”
Minister Wong identified three key areas where Papua New Guinea is taking action and seeking stronger regional collaboration:
Climate Adaptation through Nature-Based Solutions
PNG is restoring over 1,000 hectares of mangrove ecosystems through the Mangrove Rehabilitation for Livelihoods initiative.
These blue carbon ecosystems absorb emissions, protect shorelines, support biodiversity, and sustain community livelihoods.
Combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing
With enhanced vessel monitoring systems and regional observer programs, PNG is committed to eliminating IUU fishing.
Minister Wong urged APEC members to invest in traceability technologies, strengthen cross-border intelligence sharing, and support the WTO’s efforts to end harmful fisheries subsidies.
Maximizing Tuna Value Retention
While PNG’s waters account for roughly 10% of the regional tuna catch, much of it is exported without value addition.
To address this, the East New Britain Initiative has been launched to enhance local processing and ensure equitable benefit-sharing.
The initiative aims to:
-	Establish a Regional Fisheries Development Fund to catalyze investment in the fisheries value chain;
-	Launch an East New Britain Sustainability Label in partnership with international certifiers to promote traceability and responsible sourcing;
-	Build equitable partnerships with distant-water fishing nations to ensure fairer benefit-sharing and local economic opportunities.
“The East New Britain Initiative is a strategic blueprint for building value chains that benefit both our people and our environment,” said Minister Wong.
Minister Wong also highlighted that while the Western and Central Pacific Ocean supplies more than half of the world’s tuna, Pacific Island countries like PNG capture only a small portion of the full economic value. He announced the implementation of the East New Britain Initiative, a strategic national and regional plan aimed at fostering inclusive growth, value retention, and infrastructure development in the fisheries sector.
“The East New Britain Initiative represents a bold, inclusive approach to a more resilient blue economy. It embodies our commitment to value-adding, sustainability, and development that directly benefits our communities,” Minister Wong emphasized.
In conclusion, he called on APEC economies to act with unity and purpose. “The Pacific Ocean connects our economies and our futures. Let us rise to this occasion with innovation, responsibility, and shared determination to ensure our oceans remain a source of life and opportunity for generations to come.”"

Madang Governor, Ramsey Pariwa during his official visit to Anul Lutheran high school on Karkar Island in Sumkar district where he opened a new double classroom and also witnessed the launching of the school’s new SLIP plan.
Governor Pariwa also took this opportunity to present a cheque of K50,000 to assist the new junior high school.
Anul Lutheran Junior High School is a new junior high school on Karkar island. It was established primarily to ease the situation of overcrowding and to cut travel time for students from the island travelling long distances to school.
Pariwa stated that once a school produces a SLIP and submits to any donor for assistance, then priority would be set and financial support would be secured to assist the school.
Governor Pariwa also highlighted the need for better school infrastructure, doubting the education department’s roll out of the 1-6-6 policy. This policy will enable the phasing out of Grade 8 exams, allowing students to continue to Grade 9 without examinations.
He says this is because most schools do not have the infrastructure in place to cater for the students in this new government policy initiative."

PPC Baim calls for responsible use of social media,01/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4215,"Madang Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Bail has called on citizens, especially youths to use social media responsibly.
This call comes following the arrest of a young man for publishing defamatory comments against the police officers on Facebook during the long Easter weekend, where all shops were closed to observe the public holidays.
“Your voices are powerful and your online actions can shape the future of our nation. While you have the right to express your opinions and share feedback, it’s crucial to do so with respect and integrity,” Baim said.
“We welcome constructive criticism and ideas to improve our community. However, comments that spread false information, harm others reputation or promote hate are unacceptable and can result in legal consequences,” he added.
He would like to see the youth emerge into leaders instead of wasting time on defamatory comments or negative online disputes, instead channel that energy into something constructive and encouraged them to use social media as a platform for positive change by sharing ideas that uplift and inspire.
PPC Baim also called on the public to reach out to his officer if they are not satisfied with the performance of police officers or have other police  concerns, saying his office is always open for discussions.
“Feel free to come forward, share your feedback, or seek clarification. We are here to serve and work together for the betterment of our community,” he stated.
He further cautioned that laws like the Cybercrime Act 2016 are in place to protect everyone from harmful online behavior, including cyber harassment and misinformation.
“Let’s build a respectful, safe and inspiring environment online and offline. Your responsible behavior today will help shape a brighter tomorrow."

Man arrested in Madang under Cyber Crime law,30/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4208,"Police in Madang have arrested and charged 27-year-old Jonathan Kami from Raicoast district, under the Cyber Crime Act 2016 for allegedly publishing defamatory social media posts targeting members of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary.
He was arrested on April 24th, after police investigations identified two Facebook posts published on the “Madang Provincial News & Current Affairs” page on April 18th. These posts reportedly contained offensive and insulting remarks directed at police officers, which authorities say were fueled by frustration over the closure of shops in Madang Town during the Easter weekend.
Madang Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim, condemned the posts stating, “The posts insulted and offended police personnel in the worst possible manner. No member of the force should be subject to such public ridicule and defamatory language, especially when officers are simply enforcing lawful directives for public safety.”
Following the posts, Kami reportedly went into hiding after learning of a police raid on his family residence near Divine Word University. He later surrendered voluntarily to the National Criminal Intelligence Unit (NCIU) office, accompanied by his family and lawyer.
He is currently detained at Jomba police cells and is expected to appear for his first court hearing in Madang District Court in the coming days.
Baim emphasized the importance of responsible social media use by the public. While constructive criticism and freedom of expression are fundamental rights, citizens have been reminded that online speech must not cross the boundaries into abuse, defamation, or misinformation.
“We welcome feedback and constructive criticism; however, comments that undermine the reputation of individuals or institutions, especially through defamatory language are unacceptable and will be met with legal action.”
The PPC encouragds the community to use social media as a platform for positive engagement, dialogue and sharing of information responsibly. He also reminded citizens that laws are in place to protect individuals from harmful speech and that accountability remains a priority for law enforcement.
The Cybercrime Act 2016 provides the legal framework to address various online offenses, including cyber harassment, defamation and the spreading of false information. It underscores the importance of responsible digital behavior and the need to maintain respect and integrity in online interactions."
Hunters coach attributes win to good defence,30/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4207,"Following Saturday’s impressive 22-14  win over Burleigh Bears in the  Round 7 clash of the Queensland Rugby League Hostplus Cup at the Santos National Football stadium Hunters coach, Paul Aiton has attributed the win to the team’s defensive scramble that kept the Bears scoreless for the entire first half.
The Hunters have been struggling with their defensive resolve in their last two away games, losing to Ipswich Jets and Mackay Cutters.
While commending the boys for impressing with their unrelenting defense and their slick attacking prowess, Coach Aiton also commended the leaders in the group for maintaining good  cohesion and control  through the middle which set the platform for the win.
Aiton however said the only downside of the win was allowing the visitors to score two late tries in the last 10 minutes.
Aiton again emphasized the importance of keeping the error counts, down and penalties which is not helping their course and how they can improve those numbers, something they always highlight at training sessions and on game day.
Looking ahead to this week’s round 8 clash against an informed Wynnum Manly side, Coach Aiton said they won’t be taking any team lightly regardless of where they are on the table.
“It’s a tough competition and yeah doesn’t matter who the opposition we play, especially when they come playing the Hunters at home. I’m sure they’ll be preparing for a big game up here and we are not taking them lightly as well. We’re taking them rather seriously.”
Prospecting on the Hunters line up for this weekend, the coach singled out Koso Bandi as the only casualty after picking up an ICL injury from last week’s clash against Bears. He will be out while Jacob Lot comes into the starting lineup.
“We got Koso Bandi he’s got ICL so we’ve had a few ICLs now. We got Benji Kot, Whallon Tauloi and now Koso, long time injuries you know.
“It’s unfortunate but it’s just the game that we play and it’s unfortunate for those boys but then it gives some of the new boys the ability to step up and take that. Because of that, now Jacob Lot got his chance to play.”
The Hunters are bracing themselves for another tough gig at home this weekend when they face the third-placed  Wynnum Manly Seagulls at 3pm Sunday at the Santos National Football stadium."
Late Sanja Willie Honored with Posthumous Degree,30/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4204,"The University of Papua New Guinea graduated more than four hundred students from the School of Business and Public Policy today.
There were cheers of joy and excitement and celebration, loud applauses and enthusiastic clapping as families, spouses, children and friends of the graduating class witnessed their loved ones receive their degrees and diplomas.
In a poignant moment during today's graduation ceremony, late Sanja Willie was awarded his Bachelor of Accounting degree posthumously, honoring a life of determination and academic excellence tragically cut short.
Faculty, family, and graduates stood in a shared moment of silence and reflection, celebrating both his academic success and the enduring impact of his life, as his older cousin brother Jerry Recks, dressed in an all-black suit, walked up solemnly with a frame of Late Sanja held close to his chest to receive his younger cousin’s degree from the Chancellor of the University of Papua New Guinea, Robert Igara.
Late Sanja attained a diploma in accounting from Port Moresby Business College and enrolled at UPNG to attain his degree in accounting. He passed on the 2nd of April, 2025 and was laid to rest in Wapenamanda, Enga Province more than a week ago.
In a short tribute to commemorate late Sanja, Deputy Executive Dean, Academic, Dr Ponusammy Manohar stated that late Sanja was known for his humility, intelligence, deep faith and strong family values. He lived a life of purpose and left behind a legacy of love, perseverance and integrity, and greatly loved by his fellow graduates.
Though Sanja was not there to receive his degree in person, his legacy lives on through his accomplishments and the many lives he touched.
Cousin brother Jerry Recks said it was a long journey for Sanja to complete his studies to attain a degree, eight years in the making. He disclosed that the deceased died due to a drowning incident, describing the loss as being ‘still fresh’.
“It’s still fresh, we had to gather a lot of strength to be here on this day to receive his certificate on his behalf. I had to take the privilege and honor on behalf of the family to attend this graduation.”
Late Sanja is the first born of his parents, Recks said, “The parents could not come because they are still in mourning. The incident is just a little over three weeks ago, they are still up in the village, they couldn’t come. I can understand why, it’s quite nerve-wrecking because for myself, trying to walk up there. This was quite a whole new feeling, bittersweet in a way, we’ve achieved something for the last eight years we’ve struggled to get to this point, but sad that he’s not available, that’s the feeling that we’ll take away this moment.”
Recks spoke further about Sanja’s character, stating that Sanja would have turned 28 this year. He was single and had a whole life ahead of him.
“He (didn’t) smoke, he (didn’t) drink. He (didn’t) have this normal life of a 27-year-old. He was kind, gentle. Kept his Catholic faith close to him as well. His work was reflected through his life. He was one person that loved us all. Being the small brother in the family, he played his role very well but unfortunately this was a moment we were looking to celebrate but it is what it is and we cannot question God why, only God knows the reason why he took him. Sanja was a very humble, down to earth person and this would have been the crowning achievement of his young life heading into a good direction, one that was filled with a lot of hope but unfortunately, only God knows.”"

The awards will encompass 18 categories, recognizing outstanding contributions in journalism, radio, television, print, online media, and special achievements.
MCPNG President Neville Choi emphasised the significance of reinstating the awards.

Choi highlighted the dedication of media personnel amidst challenges, stating that despite criticisms, there's commendable effort in the media's current operations.
He elaborated on the structure of the awards, which include five main categories - Journalism, Radio, Television, Print, and Online - alongside a Special Awards Category. Notable awards encompass 'Journalist of the Year', 'Best Investigation', 'Best Radio Show', 'TV Presenter of the Year', 'Best News Story', 'Best Website', and 'Outstanding Contribution to Media'.
The nomination period initially spanned from March 1st to March 31st but was extended.
""We extended it another two weeks because we got interest a lot outside of the mainstream media so we said yes the nominations are open to the public,"" said Choi. ""But they must be either journalists or journalistic work that have either been published or broadcast within the mainstream media membership.""
The 2025 awards serve as a trial to streamline processes and potentially expand categories in future editions. Choi mentioned the possibility of introducing awards recognizing backend technical teams in broadcasting and digital publishing.
In conjunction with the awards, the MCPNG has launched a new website,

LDC aims to clear Lae land,29/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4187,"The Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) aims to reclaim State land at Three-Mile, Lae, starting with Portion 234.
This follows years of illegal occupation and dubious title transfers.
After visiting the affected land recently, LDC Managing Director, Terry Koim, said the facts were indisputable and the time to act was now.
“A government minute dated 14th February 1989 clearly shows that the National Housing Corporation (NHC) applied only for the southern part of Portion 234; not the whole of Portions 224, 225, and 234. Despite this, the Land Board mistakenly recommended the lease over all three portions. This was never intended. It was wrong then, and it is wrong now.”
Koim highlighted that the Department of Primary Industry (now Department of Agriculture) held a Certificate of Occupancy over the northern part of Portion 234 and intended to release 63.6 hectares to LDC for agricultural development, not for housing or illegal human settlement.
“The northern part of Portion 234, and likely parts of 224 and 225, were never lawfully meant for private housing. They were earmarked for agriculture, specifically Portion 234, which was intended for LDC.”
Koim said LDC’s actions were based firmly on government records and historical intent.
“We are not engaging in guesswork or social media theatrics. We are acting on facts, on lawful processes, and on the responsibility we carry as a national institution.”
“The eviction of illegal settlers, starting with Portion 234, is not just lawful; it is a moral obligation.
“If we fail to act, we betray future generations and the development vision intended for this land.”
Responding to critics, Koim challenged their silence over past injustices.
“Where were you when settlers forcibly removed NAQIA and the former DAL officers from this land?
“Where were your voices when public property was illegally occupied and misused?
“It is easy to criticise after the damage has been done. It is harder to stand up and put things right.
“We are not doing this for social media approval or headlines.
“We are doing this because this land belongs to the people of Papua New Guinea.
“It must be restored to its rightful purpose — to strengthen food security, economic independence, and national development.”
As Papua New Guinea marks its 50th year of independence, Koim said reclaiming State land is critical to safeguarding the country’s future through agriculture.
“At 50 years, we must have the courage to correct the mistakes of the past. As Prime Minister Marape once asked: ‘If not now, then when? If not us, then who?’ The time to act is now.
“We owe it to the next generation to reclaim, rebuild, and redevelop what is rightfully ours.”"

Prime Minister summons health officials,29/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4178,"Health Minister Elias Kapavore and other health officials have been summoned by the Prime Minister to a meeting on Friday, May 02nd 2025 to address issues raised by the country’s leading gynecologist, Dr Glen Mola.
Last week, Dr Mola raised concerns of mothers giving birth on the floor of  Port Moresby General Hospital’s maternity wing and how a Japanese aid project would have eased this burden years ago.
This came to the attention of the Prime Minister who has now intervened to address delays in a Japanese Government grant aid project to upgrade the maternity wing at Port Moresby General Hospital.
“I am aware that the Japanese Government offered to fund the refurbishment of the maternity wing,” Prime Minister Marape said. “Unfortunately, there have been delays because the hospital management did not confirm acceptance of the project.”
He acknowledged Dr Glen Mola, who raised the matter publicly, and said: “There is no reason to doubt Dr Mola, who has devoted his professional life to this field. If he says there is a crisis, authorities must act immediately and plan for the future.”
Prime Minister Marape stressed that the hospital, built for a city of under 200,000, now struggles to meet the needs of a population nearing one million.
He emphasised urgent short-term interventions and reaffirmed broader plans, including suburban hospitals and a new National Capital hospital in partnership with the NCD and development partners.
“I have summoned the Secretary for Health, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Port Moresby General Hospital CEO Dr Paki Molumi, Dr Glen Mola, and all involved to a meeting on Friday, 2 May 2025, to resolve this matter,” Prime Minister Marape announced.
He underlined the need for professionalism in handling international development partnerships: “When partners like Japan step in to help, we must not create obstacles. We must respect and honour these partnerships.”
Prime Minister Marape made these remarks after launching renovation works at the hospital’s morgue and ICU, funded by the Indonesian Government."
Election of new Pope to begin on May 7th,29/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4175,"The conclave to elect the 267th Pope will begin on May 7th, following the conclusion of the Novemdiales Masses to pray for the eternal repose of the late Pope Francis.
Vatican News reports that the Cardinals present in Rome have agreed to begin the conclave on May 7th, 2025.
The date was set on Monday morning by the approximately 180 cardinals present (just over a hundred of whom are electors) gathered for the fifth General Congregation in the Vatican.
The conclave will take place in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel, which will remain closed to visitors during those days. There is no set time frame for the conclave to sit. It continues until a new Pope is elected.
What happens during the conclave?
The conclave will be preceded by a solemn Eucharistic celebration with the votive Mass Pro Eligendo Papa, attended by the Cardinal electors. It is a specific Mass celebrated before a papal conclave. It serves as a prelude to the election of a new Pope, with Cardinal electors attending. This Mass seeks divine guidance for the electors and sets a reverent tone for the subsequent proceedings in the Sistine Chapel.
In the afternoon, the Cardinal electors proceed in a solemn procession to the Sistine Chapel, where the Conclave begins to elect the new Pope.
At the end of the procession inside the Sistine Chapel, each Cardinal elector takes the oath as prescribed in paragraph 53 of Universi Dominici Gregis.
Through this oath, they commit, if elected, to faithfully fulfill the Munus Petrinum as Pastor of the Universal Church.
They also pledge to maintain absolute secrecy regarding everything related to the election of the Roman Pontiff and to refrain from supporting any attempts of external interference in the election.
At this point, the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations proclaims extra omnes, meaning that all individuals who are not part of the Conclave must leave the Sistine Chapel.
Only the Master himself and the ecclesiastic designated to deliver the second meditation remain.
This meditation focuses on the grave responsibility that rests upon the electors and the necessity of acting with pure intentions for the good of the Universal Church, keeping only God before their eyes.
Once the meditation is delivered, both the ecclesiastic and the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations leave.
The Cardinal electors then recite prayers according to the Ordo Sacrorum Rituum Conclavis and listen to the Cardinal Dean, who asks whether they are ready to proceed with voting or if any clarifications regarding the rules and procedures.
All election procedures take place exclusively in the Sistine Chapel within the Vatican Apostolic Palace, which remains completely sealed off until the election is concluded.
Throughout the election process, the Cardinal electors must refrain from sending letters or engaging in conversations, including phone calls, except in cases of extreme urgency.
They are not allowed to send or receive messages of any kind, receive newspapers or magazines of any nature, or follow radio or television broadcasts.
How many votes are required to elect a Pope?
To validly elect a new Pope, a two-thirds majority of the electors present is required.
If the total number of electors is not evenly divisible by three, an additional vote is necessary.
If voting begins on the afternoon of the first day, there will be only one ballot. On subsequent days, two ballots are held in the morning and two in the afternoon.
After the votes are counted, all ballots are burned. If the ballot was inconclusive, a chimney positioned over the Sistine Chapel emits black smoke. If a Pope is elected, white smoke will billow out of the chimney.
If the electors fail to reach an agreement on a candidate after three days of inconclusive voting, a break of up to one day is allowed for prayer, free discussion among voters, and a brief spiritual exhortation by the Cardinal Proto-Deacon (Cardinal Dominique Mamberti).
What happens immediately after a new Pope is elected?
Once the Cardinals have elected a new Pope, the last of the Cardinal Deacons calls the Secretary of the College of Cardinals and the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations into the Sistine Chapel.
The Dean of the College, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, speaking on behalf of all the electors, asks for the elected candidate’s consent with the following words: “Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?”
Upon receiving consent, he then asks: “What name do you wish to be called?”
The functions of a notary, with two Ceremonial Officers as witnesses, are carried out by the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations, who drafts the document of acceptance and records the chosen name.
From this moment, the newly-elected Pope acquires full and supreme authority over the universal Church. The Conclave ends immediately at this point.
The Cardinal electors then pay homage and pledge obedience to the new Pope, and thanks are given to God.
The Cardinal Proto-Deacon then announces to the faithful the election and the name of the new Pontiff with the famous line: “Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum; Habemus Papam,” meaning  “I announce to you a great joy; we have a pope.”
Immediately afterward, the new Pope gives the Apostolic Blessing Urbi et Orbi from the Loggia of St. Peter’s Basilica.
The final step required is that, after the solemn inauguration ceremony of the Pontificate and within a suitable time, the new Pope formally takes possession of the Patriarchal Archbasilica of St. John Lateran."
Tragic Landslide in EHP Claims Lives,28/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4173,"A deadly landslide triggered by days of relentless rainfall has claimed the lives of a mother and her four children in Apogga village, in Gahuku Rural LLG, Eastern Highlands Province.
The tragic incident occurred around 3:00 am on Sunday, as the family slept. According to local reports, continuous heavy rain throughout the past week caused widespread flooding across Goroka township, blocking drainage systems and overflowing into streets, settlements, suburbs, and residential areas.
The victims include a young mother, believed to be in her late 30s, her 15-year-old daughter, her seven-year-old daughter, and a two-year-old baby girl. Their names have not yet been officially released.
The father of the family was away, attending an overnight church service, and was unable to return due to the bad weather.
The family’s 12-year-old son survived by digging himself out from under the debris and raising the alarm within the village in the dark early hours. Youths nearby heard the loud noise from the landslide and rushed to the scene, but were unable to render assistance as the house was completely buried.
At daybreak, community members and village leaders recovered the five bodies and transported them to the Goroka Provincial Hospital morgue.
Authorities are warning residents across Eastern Highlands Province to remain on high alert, as further heavy rainfall is expected this week."

Baru nominated before lunch in the presence of the Assistant Returning Officer and Inland Baining LLG Manager Joseph Tagil and was witnessed by defending Toma LLG President Robert Mati.
His nomination brings the number of Inland Baining LLG president seat contestants to four.
The other three contestants are John Sambie, Bangana Vinavana and Hosea Kaelam Jnr.
Following his nomination, Baru welcomed the other three contestants, citing that the LLG president seat does not belong to him and the only way to win it is through the elections.

Vipers Academy Player settles well in UK,27/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4164,"Junior Bini Kaeaka, the first Port Moresby Vipers Academy player sent abroad, has settled in well with Hull Kingston Rovers Rugby League Club in England.
The promising rugby league talent has begun classes and joined training with his new teammates at the club’s academy. Thanks to the partnership between Port Moresby Vipers and Hull Kingston Rovers rugby league clubs.
Vice Chairman of the Port Moresby Vipers, Tony Sipa, who facilitated Kaeaka’s move, said the Hull Kingston Rovers have welcomed Kaeaka with open arms, and so was his school, Hymers College. Sipa said the school has designed special courses to help Kaeaka catch up with the rest of the students, and he found himself comfortable in the new learning environment.
Sipa said Junior met up with his classmates, teachers and spent a week with him to make sure he was okay and settled well in school.
“After enrolling him at school, I took Kaeaka to the Club (Hull KR) the next day. They were grateful and welcomed him. The same day, he did his medical checks and admitted him to the team. We didn’t waste time, the first day he enrolled at the school, and the next day he joined the club.”
The Vipers' vice chairman has connected Kaeaka with several PNG Internationals based in the UK, including PNG Kumuls legend Rhyse Martin and Watson Boas. Sipa says those connections would boost Junior’s confidence and make him feel at home.
Kaeaka is staying with former Kumuls and Hull KR legend John Okul where Okul will be playing a mentor role in guiding the young man in his rugby league journey. Sipa said Okul can take Kaeaka through extra training and diet to ensure Kaeaka gets the best out of this opportunity.
Sipa hailed the move as a breakthrough for Rugby League in PNG. He said this is the ongoing partnership between the Vipers and Hull Kingston Rovers and revealed plans to send more players later this year.
Sipa said, “It’s a big breakthrough for both Vipers and Hull RK. I think in PNG, we don’t have local clubs sending their juniors to sign a contract in Australia’s Rugby League or the Super League. To send our talent to a big club like Hull KR is a big honor for us, Vipers, and the players coming through our academy program.”
He admitted that the program requires substantial financial support and urged corporate entities to support. When urging for corporate support, Sipa thanked the NCD Governor, Powes Parkop, Moni Plus, British High Commission to PNG, Hull Kingston Rovers, Vipers Academy staff, and the corporate sponsors who helped make the move possible."
Dormant film industry,27/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4163,"One of the country's first Cinematographers, Rabura Aiga, is encouraging the rightful authorities to take charge and develop the so-called ‘dormant’ film industry.
Legendary Rabura Aiga, who sat with this news team yesterday, expressed concern about the country's lack of a film industry, unlike other countries that have thriving film industries.
“Sadly, we don’t have a film industry. Like in the Philippines, they have a film industry; people produce films from private companies and sell them to TV stations to run. We do not have that; we also don’t have a pool of talents, where you can hire them to create movies, soap operas, commercials, and more.”
He suggested establishing a film association to produce documentaries and soap operas by local filmmakers. This association will promote the appreciation and advancement of film through screenings, education, and advocacy.
“We do not have a film industry because there is no market for it. We also should create a film association and produce quality documentaries, soap operas, movies and more. We Papua New Guineans have so much to give.”
Aiga is encouraging young people to join the industry, adding that modern equipment has made life easier.
“Now that filming equipment is easy to use, anyone can get a camera and take photographs and videos. But we need specialists to train so we can produce quality. The production quality has dropped.”"
Independence as seen through Aiga’s lens,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4157,"As PNG celebrates its 50th Independence Anniversary, Papua New Guinea’s pioneer Cinematographer and the last colonially-trained cameraman in the country speaks about the evolution of media in the country.
The legendary Rabura Aiga who hails from Vabukori village in the Moresby South electorate of Port Moresby, began his career in 1974 with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, when he moved into the Department of Information and Extension Services as an Assistant Cameraman, and later promoted to Chief Cameraman in 1975, a perfect independence gift.
Later in 1986, he became a Sales consultant at Chin H Meen & Sons, then as Chief Cameraman and Producer/Director at NTN Television in 1987. He also started his own Film Production Company with Frank Mills & Associate in 1989. He holds these experiences close to heart and now shares how the media has evolved as PNG prepares to welcome the 50th anniversary sunrise this September.
“I felt like it was the right place and time to be a cinematographer. I applied when the position was advertised and they got me. I didn’t know what I was going into, because it was new in PNG, but I thank God that it was probably divine intervention that I became a cameraman. “
Mr Aiga recalled many highlights in his media career, notably his participation and experience with Hollywood for the production of Robinson Crusoe. Yumi yet, Fourth Child, Marape, and Papua Besena Demonstration are among many other productions he was proud to have been part of. One he recalls clearly is the raising of the PNG flag in 1975, in Milne Bay’s provincial capital, Alotau, which he was assigned to capture.
“So I was part of the Yumi Yet film and you’ll see the footage we took there. I was part of the team to capture the flag raising ceremony in 1975 in Alotau. But looking back, it was mixed feelings, people were excited and not sure of what could happen when the Australian Government left.”
Through his lenses, Mr Aiga believes PNG was not ready enough for self-governance and explains why.
“The question on peoples’ minds are, were we ready or not? Looking back at the developments after the Independence, I think PNG was a bit too early, we were not ready and the Australian Government did not really prepare us enough before handing over a lot of things like the schools’ infrastructure and systems fell apart.”
One of the things that stand out for Mr Aiga is the difference in the level of education then and today. He strongly believes in the power of proper training and mentorship to increase work quality anywhere and everywhere.
“I went to KilaKila Secondary school when Independence came. The expatriates left and locals had to take over, there was not a proper transition or teachers were not taught to the fullest. After the transition there was not much money to improve infrastructure and the classes started deteriorating over time.”"
Kairuku Remembers Holy Father,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4156,"The passing of Pope Francis has resonated deeply across the world, and in Papua New Guinea, the people of Kairuku District have joined in mourning the loss of the global Catholic leader.
From his Bereina District Office, Member for Kairuku Peter Namea Isoaimo conveyed heartfelt condolences on behalf of the electorate’s Catholic faithful.
In his statement, Isoaimo acknowledged the Pope’s profound spiritual influence and global leadership, expressing both sorrow and respect for the role the late Pope played in guiding millions around the world, including in PNG.
""On behalf of the Catholic faithful and followers in the electorate I would like to convey my deepest condolences to the clergy in Vatican City who now mourn the passing of the holy father Pope Francis,"" Isoaimo said.
The MP reflected personally on having met Pope Francis during his last visit to PNG, calling it a privilege. He noted the late pontiff’s enduring impact as a father figure to Catholics everywhere and extended prayers for his eternal rest.
Isoaimo also touched on the hopeful possibility of Sir John Cardinal Ribat, head of the Catholic Church in PNG, playing a significant role in the election of the next Pope. He said the Church must now move forward with unity and faith as it prepares to elect a new leader.
This expression of grief from Kairuku highlights the deep cultural and spiritual ties many Papua New Guineans share with the Vatican and the Catholic faith.
For many in rural communities like Bereina, Pope Francis was more than a religious figure—he was a symbol of humility, service, and peace."
Expatriate arrested and charged under the ‘Lukautim Pikinini Act’,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4153,"A 50-year-old Chinese national and supermarket proprietor in Madang, Jack Wengs (also known by his Chinese name Yugui Weng), has been formally charged with two counts of child abuse involving his five-year-old biological son, Brian Weng. The charges follow a report made by the child’s mother, Sila Bilik, a Papua New Guinean national from Kubam village, Karkar Island, who raised concerns about Weng’s failure to fulfil his responsibilities as a parent.
Provincial Police Commander of Madang, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim emphasized that the situation involves serious concerns about the welfare and rights of the child, highlighting the exploitive nature of the relationship between Wengs and Bilik, which resulted in the birth of the child in August 2019.
Wengs owned and operated Prouds Mart, a well-known supermarket located in Madang’s central business district. His relationship with Ms. Bilik began between 2017 and 2018, during which time she worked at his supermarket. Despite initially denying paternity, Wengs eventually acknowledged the child and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Bilik at Coastwatchers Hotel, agreeing to provide a monthly family support budget of K6, 000. This support was intended to cover rent, educational expenses, food and medical costs.
Nevertheless, police allege Wengs failed to meet his financial obligations as outlined in the MOU, prompting Ms. Bilik to report the matter to the Family and Sexual Violence Unit (FSVU) at Jomba Police Station on March 13th, 2025. This led to a coordinated police operation involving the Madang Transnational Crimes Unit, the National Criminal Intelligence Unit and the PNG Immigration and Citizenship Authority.
On April 23rd, 2025 Wengs was arrested at the FSVU office in Madang around 3:49pm. His passport and visa documents were confiscated by immigration officials from Lae’s Momase Regional Office to facilitate further investigations into his immigration status. Wengs has been charged under the Lukautim Pikinini Act 2009 with two criminal offenses:
Failure to provide adequate support to his biological son. (Section 132)
Engaging in conduct likely to harm the child’s intellectual development. (Section 133(a)(b))
He was released on a police bail of K4, 000 with K2, 000 paid for each charge. This case is now a matter of the Madang District Court while immigration authorities will contiue their assessment of Weng’s immigration status in light of the criminal allegations.
PPC Baim emphasized the message this case sends to foreign nationals involved with PNG citizens, especially concerning the welfare of children. He stressed that foreign nationals must fulfil their legal responsibilities or face prosecution under PNG law.
The case highlights the importance of protecting children’s rights and ensuring that all parents, regardless of nationality, adhere to their legal and moral obligations to support and care for their children."
Reconstructive surgeries restore hope in East Sepik,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4152,"Twenty-five people from East Sepik have opened a new chapter of their lives, thanks to a life-changing collaboration between Frieda River Limited (FRL) and Interplast Australia New Zealand.
From 31 March to 5 April, Wewak’s Boram Hospital became the beacon of hope, as a team of volunteer specialists performed 29 free and delicate reconstructive procedures on the 25 men, women, and children with conditions ranging from congenital deformities like cleft lips to debilitating injuries caused by burns and bush knife traumas.
The surgical team, a multidisciplinary force of compassion and skill, included two surgeons, a trainee surgeon from Papua New Guinea (PNG), two anaesthetists, six physiotherapists, and perioperative nurses from both Australia and Boram Hospital.
Sponsored by FRL – the proponent of the Frieda River copper-gold project in remote Sepik – this initiative marked the second year of a three-year partnership, with this year’s mission seeing an increase in procedures compared to 2024.
“We successfully conducted 29 procedures on 25 patients – 12 more than last year,” said team leader Dr Sid Karanth, who also revealed a sobering detail – that nearly 90% of the injuries treated stemmed from preventable bush knife attacks and burns.
One of the patients, 17-year-old Joyce Koko, had lived with painful scars since childhood when an accident near her mother’s cooking fire left her with severe burns. Boiling oil splashed across her neck, jaw, and right cheek, leaving her with a disfigured skin. The day after the surgery, Joyce spoke softly but with resolve.
“Thank you to the doctors. I will return to school and try to live a normal life again. I want to finish school and become a nurse so I can help others.”
FRL Country Manager, Joel Hamago thanked the visiting specialists from Australia who had given their time to this volunteer mission.
“Reconstructive surgery is a costly procedure, far beyond the reach of ordinary Papua New Guineans. That is why the FRL Sepik Interplast program exists – bringing in volunteer specialists from Australia to lead these life-changing surgeries free of charge,” he said.
With the FRL Sepik Interplast partnership continuing into 2026, more lives are set to be transformed – but the deeper call remains: healing not just bodies, but communities."
NCDPHA commemorates World Malaria Day,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4151,"The National Capital District Provincial Health Authority (NCDPHA) joined the global community in commemorating World Malaria Day yesterday, with a dedicated event held at Evedahana Primary School under the theme “End Malaria in NCD”.
Malaria, one of the world’s oldest and deadliest diseases, remains a serious public health threat in Papua New Guinea. The day was aimed at raising awareness, promote prevention, and encourage early treatment to eliminate malaria in the National Capital District.
World Malaria Day, marked annually on 25 April, was instituted by WHO Member States during the World Health Assembly of 2007. It is an occasion to highlight the need for continued investment and sustained political commitment for malaria prevention and control.
Dr. James Kelly, Regional Malaria Technical Officer with the World Health Organization (WHO), led a live demonstration and emphasized the crucial role individuals play in ending malaria.
“Malaria should end with us. Everyone must avoid stagnant water, sleep under a mosquito net, and get tested if they experience fever, headaches, or joint pains,” said Dr. Kelly.
Dr. Maria Ome, Head of the Vector Borne Unit at the PNG Institute of Medical Research, highlighted the dangers of untreated malaria, particularly for vulnerable groups.
“Malaria spreads through mosquito bites, especially when infected individuals do not receive proper treatment. Pregnant mothers must seek medical care to protect both themselves and their unborn babies. Complete the full course of prescribed malaria medication to help keep your household malaria-free,” she advised.
Dr. Amos Lano, Director for Public Health at NCDPHA, reinforced the importance of timely medical attention.
“Anyone showing symptoms of malaria should immediately seek help at the nearest health facility in NCD,” he urged.
Addressing students at the event, Dr. Lano encouraged them to report symptoms promptly to their teachers and seek proper treatment. He also acknowledged the continued support of Rotary Against Malaria (RAM) and the National Department of Health (NDoH) in the fight against malaria.
“As part of our ongoing efforts, a first aid post will be established on the school grounds to monitor and manage malaria cases among students and staff,” Dr. Lano announced."
Baiyer landowners encouraged to prepare for future gains,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4150,"Landowners of the Baiyer Cattle Ranch in Western Highlands Province  have been advised to immediately register a Landowner company to maximize benefits once the cattle ranch comes into full operation.
Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) Managing Director, Terry Koim had an audience with a few landowners and settlers at Baiyer Police Station to outline LDC’s plans to revive the ranch.
“Landowners need to come together and register a company, so they become shareholders to any investment on the 4000 hectors of land.
“LDC is just a custodian of the land. We want to create generational wealth for the landowners whose land is where the Baiyer Cattle Ranch sits on,” said Koim.
Baiyer Cattle Ranch is in the Mul Baiyer electorate of Western Highlands Province.
It is a colonial property handed over to the Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) in 1982 when LDC was established.
Mismanagement and lack of good governance eventually ran the ranch down in 1992.
Today, a bulldozer is already on site with eviction notices already served to the settlers in late February this year.
“Like all other LDC properties throughout the country, we are taking back Baiyer Cattle Ranch.
“There is no need to discuss land title issues. The land belongs to LDC.
“The land was given to the Government for cattle grazing during the colonial time and then handed over to LDC in 1982, but LDC management at that time shattered the hopes of the landowners’ forefathers.
“That dream is now going to happen and LDC will make it happen,” Koim said.
With settlers moving out of the ranch, work has now commenced to build proper access roads in the valley. Fencing of the property should commence in May.
Mr Koim said by December 2025, cattle should be grazing on the once abandoned Baiyer River Cattle Ranch.
“I urge the people of Baiyer Valley to work with us and help us deliver this project in our collective interest for a better future. It's revitalization is aligned to the government's MTDP 4 2023 - 2027 policy under the National Livestock Development Program.
“This will create more economic empowerment for the people of Baiyer and their children and contribute towards the overall import replacement and food security policies of government."

91 lawyers admitted to the bar,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4147,"Ninety-one (91) lawyers were admitted to the National and Supreme Court bar today after completing 9 months of training at the Legal Training Institute (LTI) in Port Moresby.
After completing four years of study at the University of Papua New Guinea under the School of Law in 2024, these aspiring lawyers underwent additional training at LTI where they were trained on how to perform their duties in the courtroom and outside of the courtroom.
Being admitted to bar means they can now serve as legal counsels in the National and Supreme courts of Papua New Guinea.
Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika told the new lawyers that the oath they have sworn must be upheld in their profession as legal practitioners, and that the rule of law must be implemented.
Salika said legal practice is a noble profession and must be protected with integrity, dignity, and pride, with ethical standards.
“The legal profession is not a profession for you to play around with,” he said. “You are all leaders in your own right as lawyers to make a change in our society.”"

Kokoda porter shares history,24/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4129,"To mark the country’s 50th Independence anniversary, local porter of the Kokoda Track, Gibson Muri, spoke of his experience as a guide for the last 22 years.
He spoke of the pride he holds as a Papua New Guinean, honoring his ancestors, running parallel with the fight for Independence.
The Kokoda Track and Papua New Guinea’s Independence are deeply rooted in the shared history between Papua New Guinea and Australia.
Since 2003, local porter and guide for the Kokoda track, Gibson spoke of his experience and how his chieftaincy goes far back to when his grandfather was one of the ‘Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels’ who became a chief of their community along the blue mountains of the Kokoda Track.
“My grandfather used to carry the food supply for the Australian soldiers and sometimes the wounded soldiers in World War II in 1942. He then went on to work with them to navigate locations along the Kokoda Track. In 1975, when PNG gained Independence, my grandfather returned home to Manari village and became the chief.
“My Dad was born, and after that I came into this world, I made sure to follow my grandfathers’ footsteps and went back to the community and continued the journey of becoming a porter and carrier for trackers, this way I am in a way helping and supporting my family and community.”
Muri expressed pride when tracing his ancestors and relatives who were part of the carriers for the food supply and wounded Australian soldiers during World War II in 1942.
“Every time I walk the Kokoda and when I go through the pain and struggle, I think back to the time when my ancestors walked, it gives me pride. I will always respect this history and since Anzac is coming up, I’ll pay my respects and show appreciation to the ancestors.”
Now, Muri, who has partnered to create his own business called TruWarrior, is sharing the country’s special history, encouraging them to do better for the country in the coming years.
“I put my children to school and encourage them to be great men and women of this nation, so they can do better for our community. My only appeal is to seek attention for the porters and guides of the Kokoda Track. We’d like more recognition in terms of our salary, I feel that the pain we go through every walk does not correspond with the salary we are given to cater for our children.”"

“We must prepare for the possibility of price increases, supply chain disruptions, and investment slowdowns. But we also want to assure the country that we are managing our economy prudently and are focused on our national budget priorities.”
Prime Minister Marape said the sweeping tariff increases imposed by the United States on China and other key global economies represent a “tectonic shift in global trade and commerce” that will inevitably have downstream consequences for small, import-dependent nations like Papua New Guinea.
“These are not minor trade adjustments,” the Prime Minister stressed. “This is a major global event.
When the world’s number one economy imposes tariffs of over 200 per cent on the number two economy as well as all other economies, the entire global trading system is shaken.
While we do not have a significant trade relationship with the United States, we are closely integrated with China, Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, Europe, and Australia— economies that are directly impacted.”

“Unlike many peer economies struggling to attract capital, we have the largest multinationals operating here. Our job is to keep investor confidence high and ensure policy consistency. I am optimistic that despite the challenges of today, the future of Papua New Guinea remains bright,” he said."
Call for review of parole process,22/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4094,"The parole process under PNG’s criminal justice system must be reviewed to release those inmates who have faithfully served their sentences.
This was raised by Prime Minister James Marape when he visited the Bomana prison on Monday, April 21st.
Marape said this process must be reviewed without compromising the law.
He further recognized the unique challenges faced by female detainees, particularly those locked up due to domestic violence, assuring them that the government is actively looking into their issues."
PMGH CEO responds,22/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4093,"Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH) Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Paki Molumi has responded in a media statement, to concerns raised by Professor Glen Mola over the Easter weekend regarding the dire state of the hospital’s labour ward on social media.
Reflecting on the status of the ward while serving mothers in labour over 72 hours during the Easter Weekend, Professor Mola expressed grave concern on the overloading of patients, mothers giving birth with insufficient birthing facilities, space and manpower.
He referred to his own experience at the Maternity wing, where many women giving birth exceeded the number of beds available in the labour ward, forcing several mothers to give birth on the floor.
Dr. Molumi acknowledged the overload and said it is a common issue in several wards, including the emergency department, labour ward, outpatient clinics, radiology and pathology services.
However, he explained that PMGH is dealing with the challenge of providing primary and secondary health care for a rapidly growing population, not just in NCD but in the surrounding Gulf and Central provinces.
Dr Molumi said the delays in the establishment of Level 5 and Level 4 hospital facilities and staffing are compounding this challenge.
PMGH is at the same time is transitioning to become the Level 6 national tertiary referral, research, and teaching hospital, consistent with government policy. It has been making good strides on specialist services in cardiac, cancer, kidney and eye.
Regarding the 100M Japanese fully funded Women’s and Children’s Hospital as a 50th Independence Anniversary Gift mentioned by Professor Mola, Dr. Molumi explained that there was a decision taken (in consultation with PMGH's Board, National Capital District Provincial Health Authority (NCD PHA), National Department of Health (NDoH) and the Ministry of Health) with regards to a JICA Grant Proposal for Maternal and Child Health to establish this facility at Gerehu Hospital, a Level 4 Hospital.
NCD PHA aims to develop the Gerehu Hospital as a center of excellence for maternal and child health, where PMGH has a MOU with NCD PHA to provide human resources and technical support for the facility. Logically, Gerehu Hospital's strategic location offers easy access to cover over 70 per cent of city residents and 100 per cent of rural patients traveling via the Hiritano and Magi highways.
He said over 80 per cent of deliveries at PMGH are normal cases which can be handled at Gerehu allowing PMGH to concentrate on complicated deliveries and tertiary care services.
Dr. Molumi added that NCD PHA aims to develop the Gerehu Hospital as a center of excellence for maternal and child health, where PMGH has an MOU with NCD PHA to provide human resources and technical support for the facility.
He said over 80 per cent of deliveries at PMGH are normal cases, which can be handled at Gerehu, allowing PMGH to concentrate on complicated deliveries and tertiary care services.
While this longer-term plan is being implemented, the concerns raised by Dr. Mola need to be addressed urgently.
Therefore, PMGH plans to install modular delivery rooms and maternity wards at Gerehu Hospital, Six Mile Clinic and other clinics identified by NCD PHA with technical and staffing support from PMGH."
Wau roadworks progress,22/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4091,"Realignment and rehabilitation work has started on the Wau town road to Pinetop in the new Wau-Waria district of Morobe Province.
Last week, the contractor, Well Burst Engineering, started the cleaning and widening of the road from the Wau Signboard to the Katherine Lehmann School’s sharp bend.
Work has commenced after the groundbreaking ceremony by Wau-Waria MP, Marsh Narewec, in front of the district office on Monday, April 7th.
Well Burst Engineering managing director, Danny Kati, was present during the ceremony and immediately assembled his equipment and workers to start work on the road.
The other contract was awarded to a local contractor, Izi Gnaebuk Contractors, to carry out maintenance work from Wau to Nemnem in Wau Rural LLG.
Its managing director, Yosi Mambu, also mobilised all his equipment and workers and commenced with maintenance work last week.
The contractors took the long weekend off, and will resume this week.
A government team, comprising of Wau Rural LLG officer, Samuel Sesigouc, conducted awareness along the road to Four Road, Mrs Booth, Yanga top and Pinetop, informing residents about the new road works.
“We carried out awareness on the new road that would be built to Pinetop and told them that the realignment and rehabilitation work has started from Wau town and will pass through their area to connect with Pinetop this year,” Sesigouc explained.
There is no proper road connecting Wau and Pinetop, as the old road had been closed due to alluvial mining activities at the top of Yangalimu mountain.
Motorists are using the PNG Forest Products road, known as “Jinker Road”, which was mainly used to transport round logs from the plantations to the plymill in Bulolo for nearly 15 years.
The 2km winding road takes over one hour to reach Bulolo from Wau.
Local MP, Narewec, had made the commitment to build a new road that would take less travel time.
He alluded that after two-and-a-half years in office, he has managed to secure funding for the new road."
PM put emphasis on prison industry,22/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4089,"Prime Minister James Marape has introduced the concept of creating a prison industry, allowing inmates to be trained in various trades, such as carpentry, mechanics, and electrical work.
Marape said this during his visit to the PNG Correctional Service Institute in Bomana, Port Moresby yesterday.
He said the setup of this industry will ensure that the inmates impart valuable skills when they return to society after being released from prison.
Marape further urged the Correctional Service to identify the working-class inmates, such as teachers, and utilize them to take charge of running the prison industry."
Prioritising education in new district,22/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4088,"Education empowers citizens to pursue a better life for themselves and their families.
Opportunities are limitless once education opens the door.
This is why the Wau-Waria district, on Friday, March 28th, opened a number of educational projects.
While it is the newest district in Morobe – being separated from Bulolo in 2022 – Wau-Waria is becoming the fastest growing district in the province, in terms of development.
Within just two years, first-term MP, Marsh Narewec, who is a computer programmer by profession, has started building new roads, upgraded the Wau police station, built new police houses and equipped their police personnel with firearms and new police vehicles.
On Friday, March 28th, Narewec and his colleague MPs – Rainbo Paita from Finschhafen and Menyamya’s active political representative, Solen Loifa – opened and launched a number of education projects. These projects include the opening of a new 4-in-1 Grace Memorial Secondary School teachers’ house, the opening of a new 4-in-1 classroom building for Wau Primary School and the groundbreaking of a new staff house for Grace Memorial, a new science lab, a new FODE Centre and a Technical and Vocational Education and Training Centre.
Speaking under heavy downpour at the Grace Memorial Secondary School, local MP Narewec outlined the support given to all levels of education.
“For the education sector, in 2023 we started subsidising tertiary students’ fees,” said Narewec.
“In 2023, we spent about K700,000 and we subsidised the fees of over 200 students in the universities and colleges.
“In 2024, we spent about K900,000 and we subsidised the fees of over 200 tertiary students as well.
“We have only one secondary school in Wau-Waria district. This secondary school, in the first year, in 2023, we put K1 million and renovated Grace Memorial. In 2024, we spent over K1 million to construct the 4-in-1 staff house.
“For primary education, we have noted that Wau Primary School has the potential to become a junior high school, so in 2023, we spent K1 million and renovated the school. In 2024, we spent another K1 million and constructed a 4-in-1 classroom.
“Aside from infrastructure, the Wau-Waria district met all costs for primary school teachers to go for further training in 2023, 2024 and 2025 as well.
“Under TVET, we have initiated a youth empowerment program where about 51 students are preparing to graduate with National Certificate II.”
Narewec drew attention to the government’s reform in the education system, especially the Standard-Based Curriculum with the 1-6-6 structure, replacing the 3-6-4 school structure. This now involves a new framework beginning with one year of early childhood education, six years in primary school then another six in junior high school and secondary, with no dropouts.
He challenged respective school boards to prepare to cater for all students as they continue into Grade Nine – with no Grade Eight examination – and Grade 12 being their only exit.
“We want to support the national government’s education policy of 1-6-6, and because Grace Memorial is the district’s only secondary school, and all students will be continuing to Grade Nine, we will need more classrooms, dormitories and staff houses.
“We have already built a staff 4-in-1 house, and the Mineral Resources Authority will most likely open its double classroom in its own time. We acknowledge the MRA for their contribution as a development partner.”
The Grace Memorial Secondary School had been without proper running water for over a decade. Principal, Zuhukec Oting, confirmed that water has been restored after receiving funding from the provincial government’s Infrastructure Development Grant (IDG). This means students and staff can now access proper running water to cook, do their laundry and shower.
Wau-Waria’s acting district education manager, Sesinu Samandingke, said now that they have gotten their own district, they have started checking schools to make sure they are in operation, and also have implemented a monitoring system so school inspectors can do quarterly inspections.
Out of Wau-Waria’s 25 registered primary schools, only 23 are in operation. The primary schools of Tegadu and Geni have been indefinitely suspended due to their remoteness. Like other schools in the country, teachers have left their posts as life is difficult in these far-flung areas where there is no government service.
“We currently have no high school or junior high, only Grace Memorial. But under the new structure, and as was endorsed by the Morobe Provincial Education Division that each district needs to have its own high school,” Samandingke outlined.
“Next year, with the next funding, the first Grade Nine intakes will be taken in by Wau Primary School, making it Wau Junior High School.
“Another school that we will be initiating projects next year is Kasangare Primary School, which will be elevated to Kasangare Junior High School in Waria LLG, our local MP’s place. DDA has already passed K1 million to commence work.
“My job is to work with the survey department to get workers, work with our district administrator and the recently-established committee to collaborate and do groundwork until we achieve our goal.
“Garaina Primary School is also scheduled to get junior high status; close to six or seven schools are within Garaina.”
Samandingke said they have already created teaching positions for preschools, primary schools and junior high schools, including Grace Memorial Secondary School. They are now waiting for the Education Department to endorse their plan and advertise the vacancies. Additionally, new schools are to be registered.
The acting district education manager outlined that the district has embarked on an ambitious plan to ensure quality education for its people; starting from early childhood to tertiary level and youth programs."

‘Go out and be productive’,22/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4085,"Imagine the state of this country if it had productive citizens.
Chancellor of the PNG University of Technology, Sam Koim, emphasised the word “productive” when speaking to graduands at the recent 57th graduation ceremony in Lae, Morobe Province.
He issued the reminder that graduating students are the living product of many productive investments.
“You are the product of all who contributed to the making of you and now go and be productive with the power of knowledge you have acquired,” Koim said.
“In the early days of Singapore’s development, its founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew rallied all his citizens and their aspirations around one word – productivity. That one word transformed a small, resource-limited island into a global economic powerhouse.
“Today, in Papua New Guinea, the Government is spending over K7 billion on public servants’ salary alone in the 2025 budget. The challenge before us is this: Are we getting K7 billion worth of productivity in return from the public servants? It’s anybody’s guess.
“Imagine where Papua New Guinea will be and the kind of service our people would be receiving today, if all the public servants had been productive at their workplace.
“So, I encourage you graduates to go out and be productive to make a difference. No matter where you find yourself – public or private sector, employed or still finding your path – choose to be productive.
“We live in an era of unprecedented productivity tools. Generative AI, tools like ChatGPT, digital platforms – these can make you smarter, faster, more effective. They can multiply your impact – if you know how to use them wisely and ethically.
“If you don’t find your dream job, you can still be at home and be productive. Use your phone to utilise some of these digital tools to be productive.
“Remember, your education is just 10 percent of your success. The other 90 percent is effort, determination, resilience – what I call perspiration. It’s not your degree that will define you, but what you do with it.
“You may stumble. You may fail. But rise again. Continue to aspire. Continue to perspire. And above all – be productive.
“Go out and shape our nation with your productivity.”"
Condolence Message from Prime Minister James Marape on the Passing of His Holiness Pope Francis,21/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4081,"The death of Pope Francis on this Easter Monday is not only a loss to the Catholic faithful but to all humanity.
Prime Minister James Marape, on behalf of the people of Papua New Guinea, has sent his condolences.
It is with profound sorrow that I extend, on behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea, our deepest condolences to the global Catholic community and the Holy See on the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis.
He was a spiritual father to over a billion Catholics around the world and a moral voice of conscience in times of global uncertainty. His humility, compassion, and unwavering commitment to justice, peace, and the environment earned him respect far beyond the Church.
Papua New Guinea had the distinct honour of welcoming His Holiness during his historic Apostolic Visit from 6 to 9 September 2024, a moment of immense spiritual significance for our country.
During his time in Port Moresby and Vanimo, Pope Francis brought a message of unity, inclusion, and hope. His public Mass at Sir John Guise Stadium and his engagements with our young people and church leaders left an indelible impression on all who witnessed them. His words and presence inspired our people, reminding us to care for the vulnerable, to act justly, and to walk humbly with God.
To the College of Cardinals, to the Vatican, and to Catholics across Papua New Guinea and the world, we grieve with you. Pope Francis lived and died in service to God and humanity, and he now rests in eternal peace.
May his soul find rest in the arms of the Almighty, and may his life’s example continue to guide us—towards humility in leadership, compassion in service, and faith in action."

Dusin mission station receives Easter gift,21/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4074,"A cooperative society and church located in the remote Dusin in Kovon LLG, Middle Ramu district of Madang Province, received financial support to continue their work in the community.
The Kovon Coffee Cooperative Society received K80,000, and the local Nazarene Church was supported with K100,000.
The funding support is from the Madang Provincial Government, fulfilling its commitment made in 2023.
It was a surprising Easter visit from the Governor of Madang Province Ramsey Pariwa on Easter Sunday to the remote station to present two cheques.
The Dusin mission station, situated in the rugged and mountainous region bordering Middle-Ramu in Madang, Mul-Baiyer in Western Highlands, Jimi in Jiwaka and Keram in East Sepik provinces, is only accessible by air.

Madang partners with OPIC,21/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4072,"A milestone for Papua New Guinea’s agriculture sector, the Madang Provincial Government and the Oil Palm Industry Corporation (OPIC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in Port Moresby that sets the foundation for a new era of inclusive, regulated, and sustainable oil palm development.
The MoU was signed by OPIC General Secretary Kepson Pupita and Madang Acting Provincial Administrator Daniel Aloi in the presence of Minister for Oil Palm Francis Maneke and Madang Governor Ramsey Pariwa. This is the first formal provincial partnership under the new Ministry of Oil Palm, making Madang the pilot province for an innovative model that brings together national government agencies, provincial authorities, landowners, and the private sector.
“This is a historic day for our industry and our country,” Minister Maneke said.
“For decades, oil palm has developed without proper oversight or equitable participation. Today, we are charting a new path—one that is guided by law, rooted in sustainability, and driven by our people.”
Oil palm remains one of Papua New Guinea’s most valuable agricultural commodities, contributing significantly to rural incomes and foreign exchange earnings.
Yet for over 50 years, the sector has largely been sustained by private milling companies, with minimal government involvement and limited benefits flowing directly to customary landowners.
Minister Maneke noted that the Marape-Rosso Government, in its drive to boost agriculture and reduce dependency on imports, has prioritised the transformation of the oil palm industry.
This includes:
* The creation of the Ministry of Oil Palm,
* The approval of a National Oil Palm Development Policy, and
* The drafting of a comprehensive Oil Palm Industry Bill, which is now in final consultation stages.
“Our government has made the strategic decision to reclaim ownership of this industry and build a framework where landowners, provinces, and developers work together,” Maneke said.
The MoU signed with the Madang Provincial Government includes a strong focus on customary land registration, demarcation, and mobilisation—a key challenge that has hampered the expansion of commercial agriculture in PNG.
“We will work with the Department of Lands and the provincial administration to ensure landowners gain secure titles,” Minister Maneke explained.
“This makes land bankable and ensures landowners are not just bystanders but active shareholders in oil palm investments.”
This includes support for converting vast stretches of underutilised grassland in areas like the Ramu Valley into productive oil palm plantations, with full adherence to environmental and sustainability standards.
The partnership also includes collaboration with existing milling companies such as Ramu Agri Industries, while also allowing for new investment models under OPIC’s coordination where appropriate."

A time will come when you will feel like it’s the end of the road, but remember, the darkest hour of the day is before the dawn, and you have to be completely motivated and passionate to thrive to become who you want to be in life.
“When I see all of you, I see a sense of pride and honor, and I want to see this same vibe 5 years on. Keep on striving to be the best motivational force in the ICT sector,” he said.
He urges the students to use ICT to build a strong capability that will guide and force PNG to move into a new concept of building and connecting people together, to make the digital world more secure, robust, and to ensure that we are all part of the globalization that connects people and systems together.
University of Technology (UOT) Pro Vice Chancellor Dr Kaul Gena congratulated those who have come back to obtain further education in the ICT sector to upskill their knowledge, which will go a long way in contributing to the development of their workforce and to PNG as a whole.
Dr Gena said the approach they took to obtain further education signifies that learning does not stop.

These nations will receive significant funding to support bespoke national strategies that will be developed in partnership with each national federation.
The IRL Board has limited this group to four to focus resources. At the appropriate point, it will select additionally promising or strategically important nations to receive similar support.
Papua New Guinea, France and Wales are historically important rugby league nations, each with several thousand local participants, pathways into the elite game, strong rugby league cultures and have strategic advantages in their own right.

“PNGRFL's strategic appointments - including Tony Archer, Joe Grima, and Stanley Gene, amongst many others - have strengthened the performance and pathway department, ensuring sustainable growth for elite and grassroots talent.
As Papua New Guinea approaches its 50th anniversary of independence, the game celebrates not just sporting excellence but also the unity and identity forged through the game.
December 12, 2024, marked a historic milestone as Papua New Guinea secured an NRL licence, paving the way for a team in the world's top rugby league competition.

No suitable data management system for PNG: Sinai,18/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4047,"Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai shared that there is no best available data management for the country regarding the National General elections. Sinai says the structure of the local level government for elections is out of order, even though Papua New Guinea’s population is smaller than most countries.
He said he has traveled the world and seen various data management during elections in different countries, however none is suitable for PNG’s local level government structure.
“We have been given some time to hunt around the world to find the best available data management in the world and there is none,” Sinai said.
“We have a structure, ward and clan (and) we come from tribes and districts. I simply am saying we are not putting it in order. When we are asking for someone else to come and sort this out it will never be solved.”
The Electoral Commissioner then referred to Papua New Guineans as duplicates of Thomas in the Holy Bible. He said people will not trust election results through biometric voting.
“Seeing is believing. So any mindset thinking about biometrics in PNG should stop now. If someone is saying biometric will solve our problems, they need to stop. In elections, it won’t work,” he said.
“They are going to gun me down and say someone has manipulated the system.
“We have to start from the basic before we get there. What are the problems why is it happening and why are we not satisfied. I have travelled the world already and for me I have seen nothing.”
Meantime, polling for LLG elections is scheduled to begin next week, however Sinai says it will not be as smooth-sailing with existing electoral roll issues."
‘Keep on keeping on’,18/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4045,"It’s not the end, if you haven’t figured what to do with your life yet.
This was the encouragement from a registered valuer and alumna of the PNG University of Technology, Dr Flora Kwapena, during the university’s 57th graduation ceremony on Friday, April 11th, in Lae.
Dr Kwapena, who was the guest speaker at PNGUoT’s 57th graduation ceremony, in Lae, has served in different sectors throughout her professional career; from academia to the private sector, public service and research sector as well.
Speaking to the over 800 graduands, Dr Kwapena gave the gentle reminder that each person has his or her own timeline. And it is not the end if they have not figured out their path yet.
“I was unemployed for a year after I had graduated,” she recalled. “Then I got a job at Qantas Airways as a sales consultant; nothing to do with the degree that I got at Unitech. It wasn’t my dream job but I was getting an income. That’s the main thing.
“Every day, I tell myself: ‘Things will get better. I just have to keep on keeping on.’”
Dr Kwapena, who is currently running her own small-to-medium enterprise, highlighted that social factors such as unemployment, discrimination, lack of support and financial hardship may lead to depression for new graduates. However, she urged them to always believe in themselves and persevere.
“They just have to keep on keeping on because tomorrow is always a better day,” she continued.
“It was a year later that I got a job in a real estate company and I was the assistant valuer. From there, I started to do what I graduated in from Unitech – valuation. And that led me to the public service.
“Funny thing is, I went under the mentorship of the first Valuer General of Papua New Guinea, Mr Mark Kelep. And I became the first female Valuer General of Papua Guinea, which is a post that I am very proud of.”
Her training under Mr Kelep led to her employment as a Senior Valuer with the Lands Department. There, Dr Kwapena obtained her registration as a Registered Valuer in PNG, and was also awarded an AusAID scholarship to do a Master’s in real estate at the University of New South Wales.
Armed with her Master’s, she taught at PNGUoT, then moved on to becoming the valuer general of PNG for one term, then continued on to the research sector with the National Research Institute of PNG as a Research Fellow (in the Property Sector Program).
It was from NRI that she pursued a PhD at the University of Sunshine Coast, in Queensland.
After obtaining the highest level of academic achievement, a PhD, Dr Kwapena has “realigned, reassessed and redirected” herself towards self-employment, operating a small property valuation firm.
“It is the hard days that will challenge you to your very core and will determine who you are,” outlined PNG’s first female Valuer General.
“You will be defined not just by what you achieve but by how you survive.”"

The ENB Provincial Government is co-funding the Ward and LLG elections this year with K4 million out of the total estimated election budget of K8 million.
The PNG Electoral Commission (PNGEC) captures the balance of that budget for the conduct of elections in the 382 wards and 23 Local Level Governments of the province.
Mano assured the provincial government’s partnership with the PNGEC through Provincial Election Manager, Joap Voivoi, saying they will continue to provide support to ensure the elections are carried out.
“A lot of people doubted whether the elections would be conducted, but the national government has made a decision for the elections to be held at this time. Elections are a part of the democratic process for any country that recognises the rights of a human being,” Mano stated.
He said the elections are part of PNG’s Constitution under the Organic Law on Elections, and thus by law, it is now being executed.
Provincial Election Manager and Provincial Returning Officer, Joap Voivoi, in announcing the election dates, said the province has 23 Assistant Returning Officers (AROs) as per the number of LLGs in the province, who will be accepting nominations at their respective LLG chambers, except for some of the 5 new LLGs that are still without an LLG office.
“The province has a total of 137 polling teams to cover 534 polling venues. Polling officials total 196, while there are 345 counting officials,” Voivoi outlined.
“Nomination fee is K200 across the board for both candidates contesting the Ward Member and LLG presidential seats.
“Nominations will be accepted for the first five days by the AROs at their respective LLGs, while I will be accepting nominations in the last two days of the seven-day nomination period (24th April – 1st May).”
As opposed to the previous election, East New Britain is among a number of provinces that will see both the Ward Member and LLG President voted by the people.
Ballot papers for the Ward Member are red while and LLG President ballot paper is green.
Mano has also called for quality leadership in these elections, saying the province needs leaders who are bold and can micro-manage their constituents to be self-reliant and self-sufficient.
“Amidst our current issues in the province, we need leaders at the ward and LLG who are not quick to blame others but are responsible for their own communities. And these are leaders who experience the hardships with their people and work with them to resolve issues, as they persevere to develop their communities,” he stated."
Madang welcomes SME credit scheme,17/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4040,"Thousands of people representing all six districts of Madang Province converged at the Bates oval in the heart of Madang town on Friday April 11th, 2025 to witness the launching of the Madang Provincial Government’s Small-Medium Enterprises (SME) scheme.
The launch of this much-awaited K5 million scheme was in waiting for more than two years as the provincial Commerce department and SME Corporation (SMEC) under the Centre for Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI) equipped locals with financial literacy skills.
The scheme will be facilitated through the National Development Bank (NDB) to assist start-up entrepreneurs or established SME’s seeking additional funding to boost their entities.
NDB Deputy Head of Branches, Lloyd Piari and SMEC acting Managing Director, Petrus Ralda acknowledged the Madang government for being the first in the country to allocate more funding to support SMEs.
Governor Pariwa said, “After much negotiations with NDB and the Commerce Division, the criteria approved for the SME credit include a minimum loan of K5,000 to a maximum of K20,000; the repayment term is two years and interest rate is 7.5 per cent per annum,” Governor Pariwa explained.
Pariwa clarified that the priority of the loans is in five categories, namely Agriculture SME, Women SME, Youth SME, Manam SME and General SME.
He said with the SME Credit Program, the people of Madang will see the provincial government come down to them to boost their SME activity or business and improve their living standards.
Pariwa said the SME Credit Program will potentially create jobs, put money in the pockets of Madang’s hardworking citizens like farmers, fishermen or aspiring entrepreneurs.
“The government will not come and do everything for you. The government will not come and buy your roofing irons and build your houses. No!
“The duty of a responsible government is to create possibilities for its people. It is the people that will have to put in the hard work to rise beyond their current state,” he concluded.
Pariwa encouraged others to attend an SME Financial Literacy Training so they can be given a certificate that will make them eligible for the SME credit program.
Madang locals can visit the provincial Commerce Division to get more information on the SME Credit program requirements, process and procedures."
PNG not ready for elections,17/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4037,"Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai reveals that the country needs an updated electoral roll to conduct future elections.
He said this when highlighting setbacks, however, Sinai said the Local Level Government elections will commence next week.
The PNG Electoral Commission will go ahead to issue writs next week for the Motu Koita Assembly and the LLG elections throughout the country will go ahead as scheduled.
Sinai said PNG will still face the same issues every election year, unless the electoral roll is updated. He said this during the signing ceremony of an MoU between Motu Koita Assembly, NCDC and the Electoral Commission on Wednesay, 16th April.
“Electoral roll is a prevailing issue. In Motu Koita we have 14 wards and I wish if we can identify all those people by age, group, clan, tribe, and ward, it would be good for the elections now and the Motu Koita open electoral in 2027. So, we are looking at that kind of perception in terms of data, unfortunately we are not given enough time that can satisfactorily complete the job, so we are happy about being prepared for elections.”
Sinai called on citizens to consider these facts and not to blame anyone for election related issues.
“Who are we going to blame if we are not going to prepare ourselves for the elections, at some extent we are in charge but as people we have to know where our identity is.”
Sinai said his aim is for every citizen to practice their right and vote, with proper identification.
“As the Commissioner I want to see everyone get ready to cast the vote. We have done practical changes to the roll, we are advocating face-to-the-name roll under biometric identity we trialed at Tatana in December last year, Kupiano and ward 5 and it worked there's some costs but it's working.”
His suggestion of face identification biometric database is not a solution to election issues, but a deterring factor as it comes back to database.
“These are things we need to sort out before elections, this is the right time to do it before 2027.”"

Sumkar cocoa development project makes progress,17/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4025,"Sumkar District Cocoa Development Program is an initiative of the Sumkar District Development Authority (SDDA).
Despite it being a yearly planned activity in the sector for the past decade, funding has always been the main challenge. Though there were other factors (as the pod borer, the low pricing, lack of farmers interest, etc.) that hindered the progress of the cocoa development activities, funding was the factor that weighed more and that could have solved other limiting factors.
Opportunity for the district agriculture sector to implement those planned activities for cocoa development in the district arose when funds were made available by the SDDA in the third quarter of 2024.
The Sumkar DDA has supported a cocoa development program aimed at revitalizing the local cocoa industry. The program has begun with the distribution of a 100, 000 polybags and now nursed in numerous nurseries across both LLGs this effort is to support cocoa farmers to improve and increase cocoa production in the district, the province and the nation as a whole.
In line with revitalizing cocoa production within the district, they have engaged in various activities to enable farmer capacity in both LLGs of Sumgilbar and Karkar to benefit from the current high return rate of cocoa bag sale.
Nursery establishment
A sector Nursery with a capacity of 12, 000 polybags has been established at the Miak DPI station to not only support but to sustain the initiative of the DDA. It is anticipated that by June this year, the clonal seedlings would be ready for field planting. The clone materials would be sold to public on a favorable price just to sustain the nursery operations for the next cycle.
Cloning & Budding
Following the successful distribution of polybags, budding activities have started on Karkar Island and will slowly come across to the mainland. This involves budding high-yield clonal seedlings, which is a key step towards ensuring better productivity and crop quality.
Budding activities have commenced starting from Miak cocoa nursery last month and will continue through to August. Very experienced and skilled budders would be engaged for the 100, 000 rootstocks raised.
According to the Office of the Sumkar MP, Alex Suguman, this would be an expensive exercise but needs to be done so that all rootstocks are cloned before bound for field planting. In addition, they will be conducting necessary cocoa husbandry trainings in the nurseries to the selected participating farmers, which is also an additional cost.
It is anticipated that after three years, the cocoa trees currently nursed from the polybags distributed would have been bearing and by the fourth year, it would have started its potential yield till its 10th year of full potential.
“We will definitely have an increase of around 90, 000 cocoa trees which is around 144 hectares to the current cocoa tree population in the district after a year from planting,” said Suguman.
Additionally, a projection of the Return of Investment is calculated to be at 210.86 percent. The given ROI is derived from an estimated total revenue of K76, 400 with a net profit of K51, 850 aft the 4th year of planting.
“This gives me the opportunity to report on another similar program in our Sumkar district. Sumkar District is set to roll out another cocoa program, funded by the province. Notably, the provincial cocoa development project is well-aligned with the Sumkar DDA’s existing initiative of creating an opportunity for collaboration and synergy between the district and provincial programs.
“This` alignment is expected to amplify the impact of the overall cocoa development effort and further benefit local farmers.”"

Joy whose part East New Britain and Oro, is a third-year student on scholarship under Athletics Development program at the National Sports Institute in Goroka. The program helps students to train and study at the same time.
Joy said she's really embracing the challenge so far juggling Sports training and her studies.
""So far it's been so good for me I think for the other athletes too because everything is provided for us. But then it comes back to us. If we dedicate ourselves to it. . but so far so good,” Joy briefly reflects back on where her interest in athletics started.
“For me I think it started from school carnivals. I was in 7th grade when I started. It wasn't much of an interest for me but when there's school carnivals I just go out there to compete and somehow became good at it. That's when I realized the potential I have in athletics. As I continued to take part in carnivals my interest continued to grow as well.”
She said that it was through head coach, late Ssmu Sasama who saw her potential got her into the program. Some of her highlights so far including attending the Oceania Athletics Championships in Fiji June 2024.
""This Oceania Championships really surprised myself. I didn't think I would go and to run a good time and stand on the podium, but yes, we performed well there and I ran a PB too which I' myself so proud of and also helped to get some medals for PNG.""
Joy was always thankful for making the team to her coaches while acknowledging God for making everything possible. Her next focus and biggest challenge is the Pacific Mini Games in Palau in June.
She said training started as early as mid-February and although challenging she's committed it physically, mentally and spiritually and happy with her progress so far.
""I had to keep myself keeping on mentally, and physically training on the track, both juggling studies and training at the same time. So, for me it's been going good and I'm hoping to keep it up until the games.""
She targets for the Pacific Mini Games is to run some more new personal bests, and try beat her own times. Even breaking the national record would be a pinnacle of her journey so far but had to work really hard for it.
While she's so grateful for the support of her family it was also an emotionally moment remembering the passing of her late dad early this year which was devastating being her strongest supporter.
For him (dad) he's the one who believed in me that I could make it in athletics. Sadly, dad passed away before he could see run on the big stage.
Joy extended her gratitude to the National Sports Institute for giving her the opportunity to be part of the program especially, director Janet Gimots and the coaching staff Philip Nomane and Subul Babo, and fellow athletes for being great companions at training."

Datec celebrates 14th graduation ceremony,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4014,"The Datec Learning Centres of Port Moresby celebrated its 14th graduation ceremony today at the Sir John Guise Stadium.
About 255 students graduated from six programs include, Information Technology, Server & Network Administration, Data Analysis & Data Science, Project Management, Data Analysis & Business Intelligence, and Cyber Security.
Affiliated with the University of Technology, Datec Learning Centers was established in 2010 to provide job-oriented and industry-skills-focused diploma programs in Papua New Guinea.
Datec General Manager Ravichandran Chandran, DLC’s objective is to deliver high-quality programs that address the 1400 skill gaps in the industry. To date, over 1200 students have graduated from their programs, with 60-70 percent of them successfully securing employment.
“Students, it has been so encouraging to witness how you have grown in confidence, faith, knowledge, and understanding during the last two years. We hope that we have assisted you in laying the foundations for success as you continue your journey through life.
“You have moved from a world with given challenges, you are to embrace another one with its specific challenges. Besides, you have just made a step; do not forget that there are other levels,” he said.
Chandran said the institution plans to focus more on AI programs in the coming year, as they anticipate that these skills will be in high demand both locally and globally in the near future, and encourage the students to use AI not only in their career but in the workforce as well.
University of Technology Vice Chancellor Dr Ora Renagi, who shares similar sentiments, encourages the students to avoid copying what AI gives to them but to understand the concept of AI and implement it in their own understanding.
Dr Renagi challenged the graduates to use their knowledge to contribute to the development of PNG, using skills and tactics of innovation."
MKA Wins Court Case,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4011,"The National Court in Waigani on Tuesday 15th April ruled in favour of Motu Koita Assembly (MKA) following an application to restrain its operations.
The application also asked the Court to issue restraining orders against current MKA Chairman and his Assembly Members from holding office. This too was dismissed by the Court.
The Plaintiffs in the matter are Veata Patana, Edward Collett and Russell Wavik among others.
The Court found that the plaintiffs had no arguable case, stating that the MKA Act has clear provisions to allow for members to remain in office until the return of the writ of the next general elections.
The Court made the following remarks, regarding the question of whether the Plaintiffs have an arguable case; “contrary to what the plaintiffs claimed to be a violation of their rights under Section 50, there is a strong defense by the second defendant that no serious issue has been established in these proceedings because Section 11(2) of the MKA Act applies in a case where regardless of the expiration of five years, elected members including the Chairman of the Assembly hold office until the date fixed for the return of the writs for the next general elections held after their election.”
After reviewing the evidence provided, Judge Makail stressed the need for continuity within MKA to avoid a vacuum and to protect the integrity of the due process until the next general elections are held.
The Court also ordered all the plaintiffs pay all of the Assembly and Dadi Toka Jr’s legal bills."
Milne Bay Community Rallies for Disaster Relief,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4008,"In the true spirit of unity and compassion, the Milne Bay community in Port Moresby is coming together for the First Milne Bay Community Fun Day – Ae Kapore Island Jam Session, aimed at supporting over 3,000 people affected by recent torrential rains and king tides on Ware Island and nearby communities within the Bwanabwana Rural LLG and Samarai-Murua districts.
The event, set for Saturday, April 19 at Kamane Recreation (formerly Sportsmen Bar), Murray Barracks, will serve as a donation drive under the Ware Island Community Disaster Relief initiative. Spearheaded by concerned locals Jerome Peniasi, Jerry Mark, and Abigayle Maggio, the fundraiser is supported by wONEm Direction and the Milne Bay Community Association Inc. (MBCA).
Communities in Ware Island are facing dire conditions—subsistence gardens have been washed away, fresh waterholes destroyed, and daily survival has become increasingly difficult.
“The impact is heartbreaking,” said event co-organizer Abigayle Maggio. “People have lost not just homes, but their food, water, and sense of security. We cannot sit by and do nothing.”
The Ae Kapore Island Jam Session has grown into a beloved cultural event over the past two years, combining Milne Bay’s rich music heritage with a platform for local SMEs to sell traditional food, crafts, and clothing.
This Saturday’s edition will feature over 20 local SMEs and live performances from Kapole Stringband (wONEm Direction), Peter Philemon of Alopops, Extracts of Alotau, and surprise local artists.
The event is more than entertainment—it’s a lifeline. In previous years, proceeds supported vital causes such as:
2023: Funding local rice farming in Bou, Logea, Sariba, and Wamira through the Trukai Smart Farmers Program.
2024: Delivering more than 15 bags of essentials and 50 bags of 10kg Skel Rice to flood-affected communities in Goodenough Island.
Recognised by the National Cultural Commission, wONEm Direction—a stringband collective of youths from Suau, Dobu, Wagawaga, Nuwakata, and Misima—is also helping preserve Milne Bay’s iconic 5-key string band sound while using music as a tool for social impact.
Looking ahead, the MBCA and wONEm Direction plan to host four Community Fun Days in 2025, each supporting a different rural community in need.
“When one island hurts, we all feel it,” said co-organiser Jerry Mark. “This is about helping each other, the Milne Bay way.”
Organisers are calling on the public to donate, attend, and support this community-led effort. For those unable to attend but wishing to contribute or partner in future fundraisers, email wonemdirection@gmail.com or message the official MBCA Facebook page."
Man arrested for impersonating Madang administrator,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4006,"Police in Madang have arrested and charged a man for impersonating the Acting Madang Provincial Administrator, Daniel Aloi an act that sought to disrupt official administrative process.
The suspect, Junior Keving, 28, from Yandra village in Usino-Bundi district, was apprehended on Friday, April 11th at 3pm. This arrest followed an investigation into a fraudulent letter intended to undermine the authority of the Acting PA.
The letter dated, April 8th and delivered on April 10th to both the Provincial Treasury Office and Bank of South Pacific Finance Limited Madang branch, cast doubt on Mr Aloi’s legitimacy, thereby misleading critical financial and administrative operations.
Madang Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim, confirmed the suspect’s arrest stating that police acted based on substantial legal evidence.
“This individual deliberately misled government institutions by using false claims to impersonate a public office holder. Our investigation revealed that the letter referenced an outdated court order that had been dismissed by the National Court on March 7th,” said Commander Baim.
He emphasized the importance of adhering to proper communication channels in administrative matters.
“There are no ongoing court matters related to this case. The suspect’s actions not only contravene the law but also pose a serious threat to the administration and financial functions of the Provincial government. Impersonating public servants to interfere with official processes is unacceptable,” he added.
Baim further warned that any individual attempting to disrupt government operations will face legal repercussions.
The suspect has been charged with one count of impersonating a public officer under Section 97 of the PNG Criminal Code Act and is in police custody. Authorities indicate that further arrests may occur as investigations continue into any additional parties involved.
Commander Baim urged the public to avoid spreading misinformation and to uphold the rule of law and administrative procedures within the province."
Children deserve to thrive,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3998,"Papua New Guinea has faced ongoing challenges in health, nutrition, and development, leading to persistent malnutrition that impacts infants, children, women, and men at all stages of life.
This malnutrition often results in decreased productivity within communities, hindering their ability to create economic opportunities and escape the cycle of poverty.
On Wednesday, April 9, 2025, World Vision Papua New Guinea (WVPNG) signed a Sub-Grant agreement with the Department for Religion and Community Development at Sambra Haus in Port Moresby.
This agreement with the DFCDR bolsters WVPNG’s ongoing efforts to combat malnutrition and address the underlying causes of poverty and inequality as part of our Health and Nutrition Portfolio.
Present at the signing was Secretary of Religion and Community Development Jerry Ubase, Deputy Secretary Implementation- Karen Haive, Deputy Secretary- Equality and Inclusion- Jack Simbou and Component Manager, CNSP Project-Joseph Klapat, alongside the World Vision PNG team including National Director Chris Jensen, Program Operations Director Godfrey Bongomin, Program Development and Quality Director Christabel Chan, and Health and Nutrition Portfolio Manager Agnes Tal and Freda Pake - a  representative from the World Bank.
This project funded by the World Bank targets to reach 60,000 beneficiaries in key impact areas in the selected provinces.
WVPNG will begin the second phase of this project in the Western and Madang provinces, focusing on enhancing child nutrition through sustainable economic practices for 20,000 mothers and their children in the first 1000 days in 60 communities across these two provinces.
Secretary Ubase emphasized the importance of collaboration.
“We rely on partners like World Vision PNG to deliver such nutrition programs through their experience and technical expertise. We believe this project will improve the lives of children in vulnerable communities of PNG.”
In alignment with World Vision’s mission for every child to thrive, National Director Chris Jensen expressed gratitude to the donors and partners involved in the initiative.
He highlighted the significance of cooperation, noting, “No single organisation can do this alone. We are grateful to be part of this project alongside the World Bank, partner NGO, the Department of Community Development and Religion, and local authorities. Together, we can achieve meaningful outcomes.”
The desired outcomes for this project include providing families, particularly women and children, with economic and sustainable support to foster nutritional change at home. Key tangible outcomes will involve:
1. Monthly child grants deposited directly into the savings accounts of mothers and caregivers, ensuring access regardless of location, and empowering women to make informed financial decisions. By enhancing their investments and understanding of nutrition, these women will improve their children's health and well-being. WVPNG will gather data from women, caregivers, and health posts to measure the impacts of the child grant.
2.  Strengthening caregivers' resilience through improved financial management and sustainable agriculture by promoting “Savings for Nutrition.” This initiative aims to increase household cash flow for better food, shelter, education, and other essential expenses for children.
3.  Raising awareness within the community regarding climate change and disaster preparedness.
4. Establishing backyard gardens for caregivers, allowing them to cultivate nutritious food sustainably for consumption and potential income generation.
This collaborative effort represents a significant leap towards tackling malnutrition and fostering healthier futures for children and families in Papua New Guinea."

Counting for by elections will happen at a designated center and not at the wards and LLG level.
“For the by-elections, we will have separate counting centers but polling in the same location.
For Morobe and Highlands regions, they will vote for their councilors, who will then meet in the chamber to vote for their president.”
He said the polling and counting for the councilors, presidents, and by-elections will take place within 14 days. Therefore, he urged the community to work with the election officials to ensure transparency is upheld during the election.
“For the rest of the country, we will have 14 days polling and not one day. Polling, count, go to the next ward, poll and count until we finish. We will have two polling teams in one LLG, but with bigger populations and wards, we will increase the team.”

Feeder Road Delay Affects Rural Communities,14/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3972,"Residents in the Koiari Local Level Government area have raised concerns on the lack of progress on the Koitaki to Doe road.
The 25-kilometre feeder route is in disrepair—despite over half a million kina already paid for its rehabilitation.
According to locals, on December 18, 2024, the Department of Central paid K590,362.10 to a local contractor as 40 percent mobilisation funding for Phase 1 works, which was to include regrading of the deteriorating road. But today, four months later, there are still no signs of machines or workers on site.
Community leader Oga Erehe stated, “I am appealing to the political leaders to consider our concerns. The feeder roads are very important where majority of the population live and survive in rural areas.”
“Our road from Sogeri to Doe has been neglected for over 50 or 60 years. During colonial times, this was a good road. Since Independence, it went back to the 40s and 30s road conditions – very, very bad.”
The poor state of the road not only affects everyday travel for villagers but also hinders the rollout of a significant impact project by Golden Peak Limited, a 100 percent nationally owned company ready to commence work at the road’s end.
Locals are now demanding an immediate investigation by the Central Provincial Administration, Governor, and the Hiri Koiari MP, urging that the contract be reassigned to a capable, transparent contractor with machinery, manpower, and proven capacity to deliver."
A journey of resilience,14/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3970,"For the first time ever, the PNG University of Technology hosted its graduation ceremony outside its main Taraka campus in Lae, Morobe Province.
Under clear skies on Friday, April 11th, graduands in their flowing academic regalia lined up in their respective schools, in anticipation of the procession into the Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium’s indoor complex.
Leading the charge was 49-year-old Kainantu woman, Helen Osora; the only female Doctor of Philosophy graduand in applied physics.
She is one of the 54 candidates graduating from the Faculty of Postgraduate Studies, Research and Innovation; three PhDs, 11 Postgraduate Certificate in Student-Centred Teaching and 40 Master’s from various disciplines.
Her determination to accomplish that milestone saw her complete her studies within the given four-year timeframe, despite taking one year off due to severe illness.
Her thesis was on “Synthesis and Electrochemical Investigations of some Metal Oxide Based Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanocomposite for Supercapacitor Electrode Applications”.
“I did my study on battery – energy storage. But more specific on battery,” she explained.
Osora’s research looked into incorporating graphene oxide with transition metal oxides to work out the energy density. Energy density is the amount of energy that can be stored in a battery, taking into consideration its size or weight.
“I did the hybrid type because we have capacitors which store energy, and we also have batteries. Batteries have more power while capacitors have less energy density but they charge faster and discharge very fast too. So, I had to come up with a hybrid; I combined the features of the capacitors and the batteries so it will take a short time to charge car batteries. For example, Tesla is currently using the charging stations for its electric vehicles.
“So, I had to come up with a supercapacitor; that’s the name given to the hybrid type.”
The mother-of-three has been teaching physics at the University of Goroka since 2008. Prior to that, she had taught at the PNG University of Technology for four years.
She had completed her Master’s in Applied Physics, returned to UOG and worked for five years, then went back to PNGUoT to complete her PhD under UOG sponsorship.
“I’ve developed physics courses for the University of Goroka,” she beamed when asked about a highlight in her career.
“That is the most satisfactory thing that I can do to give back to my country.
“Since 2008-2019; in between that, I was able to produce several courses for the university. So, currently, students are taking my physics courses.”
Osora, who has had to raise her three children by herself, thanked the University of Goroka for supporting her Master’s and PhD studies.
She shared that she fell ill in October 2020, and was sick for the duration of 2021. Her three children – the youngest being only 12 years of age – were her pillars of strength throughout that time. She acknowledged them for supporting her through a turbulent period.
Osora also appreciated the PNGUoT vice chancellor, Professor Ora Renagi, for always encouraging postgraduate students.
“Unitech is advancing compared to other universities,” she stated.
“Most importantly, I give praise and honour to God because I went through difficulties and God was always with me.
“Also, my thank you to my supervisor, Dr Senthilkumar Velusamy. I was sick and I can remember, I wanted to withdraw and I asked him but two times, he said, ‘This is not my plan for you.’
“My supervisor was always at my back until I completed my studies so I am very thankful for him. I was lucky to have him.”"

Former Madang principal arrested for misappropriation,13/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3967,"Former principal of Aiome Anglican Secondary School Francis Kumo, was arrested last month (March) on charges of abuse of office and misappropriation of school funds. This action follows a formal complaint lodged in 2024 by teachers and school board members, alleging Kumo misused funds and engaged in fraudulent activities from 2018 to 2024.
Even through Kumo is no longer working for the school, it is alleged that Kumo reportedly continued to access the school’s operating account in February 2025, where he allegedly withdrew K21, 000 without authorization from the school chairman or administration. Investigators also noted a suspicious payment of K4, 600 to HF Trading Limited for fuel, which school officials could not account for.
Madang Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim confirmed the arrest, stating, “The former principal was arrested at the Anglican Church premises in Madang town on Sunday, 2nd March 2025. He is currently in custody facing charges under the PNG Criminal Code Act for Fraudulent Appropriation of Power and Misappropriation of Property.”
The school’s financial records from 2018 to 2024 were examined using a search warrant, aiming to uncover further irregularities including transactions with vendors like BNBM Hardware for undelivered materials.
Baim emphasized the importance of integrity in public service, urging officials to serve the community with respect. The investigation is ongoing and police have called on anyone with information to come forward.
Kumo, 49, hails from Monega village in Sine LLG, Chuave District of Chimbu Province, and remains in custody as investigations continue.
The financial mismanagement has severely impacted the school, leading to food shortages and a lack of essential supplies, ultimately causing classes to suspend in 2024 and infringing on student rights to education."

Limit people’s movement into barracks says Manning,13/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3965,"Police Commissioner David Manning has issued directives to police officers residing in all the barracks in NCD to limit the movement of people moving into the barracks from Friday, 11th April to Sunday, 20th April.
Commissioner Manning said this is to maintain discipline and good order within the force during the period of heightened social and political tension.
In support of that, the commander of NCD and Central provinces Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi has tasked all barrack officers under the command of the OIC Barrack NCD Chief Inspector Sengi Laki to ensure that these instructions are enforced.
He emphasized that police officers must comply with this directive because their wives, husbands, and children need privacy and quality time with them. He also stated that relatives and friends of police officers must adhere to this and respect their friends or relatives who are in the barracks. Additionally, he called on the senior officers residing in the barracks to lead.
""We, as commanders and NCOs, must lead by speaking to our officers who are stepping out of line in the barracks. It all starts back at our house and continues to the workplace. If we can give commands at our respective police stations or sections, it's the same that we must do in the barracks. I want officers with ranks to lead by example,"" Turi said.
Commander Turi said all barracks must adhere to the directives from the commissioner."
St John responds to vehicle collision,13/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3964,"The National Ambulance Operations Centre received a 111 call yesterday at 4:20pm reporting a collision involving two vehicles at Bomana Junction in the nation's capital.
The National St John Ambulance Service immediately dispatched two general ambulance crews and a clinical response unit. The incident was initially reported as involving a casualty trapped inside an easy loader truck.
Upon arrival, ambulance crews found that bystanders had partially assisted the casualty at the scene. A passing backhoe reportedly was used by members of the public to force open the vehicle door and remove the casualty.
According to the attending ambulance clinician, HEO Wemin Kopta, the patient was semi-conscious with serious injuries. Ambulance officers worked to stabilise him at the scene and then transported him urgently to Port Moresby General Hospital for further treatment.
Ambulance Public Affairs Alvin Leka, said the National St John Ambulance acknowledges the public’s goodwill and desire to help.
“However, we strongly urge members of the public not to attempt to remove injured persons from crashed vehicles unless there is a clear and immediate danger, such as fire.
“Well-intended but untrained actions can result in further harm to the injured. Just last week, an attempt by bystanders to assist resulted in a car being flipped and rolling down a slope, putting lives at greater risk.
“We ask all members of the public in Port Moresby and Central Province to please wait for professional emergency responders to arrive. Our teams are trained and equipped to manage injuries and safely extricate patients from vehicles. Your patience and cooperation help save lives,” Leka added.
Meanwhile, Police are investigating the incident."
Provinces breaking Organic law s.119,13/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3963,"Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs Soroi Eoe is deeply concerned about the constant lack of reporting by provincial governments on their performances, and has appealed to the provinces to submit their annual reports as required by law.
Minister Eoe also reminded provincial leaders that his department still has the legal mandate to demand for the administrative and financial audit of provincial governments, including holding individual leaders and bureaucrats accountable.
Under the Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Governments (OLPLLG) Section 119, all provincial governments are required to submit their annual performance reports on time, yet this has not been happening consistently over the last 10 years. Annual Provincial Performance Reports cover Minimum Priority Activities (MPAs), Governance, Health, Works & Transport, Law & Justice, and Primary Production.
A report from the Department of Inter-Government Relations has revealed that more than half of provincial governments have failed to comply with this necessary requirement over the years, especially from 2014 to 2023.
Minister Eoe said, “It is deeply concerning that only 10 out of 22 provinces have consistently complied with these requirements over the past 10 years. This lack of compliance not only undermines the principles of transparency and accountability that are fundamental to our governance but also hampers our ability to effectively monitor and enhance service delivery across the nation.
""The consequences of this non-compliance are severe and far-reaching. Our latest consolidated Annual Provincial Governments Performance Report (APGPR) has highlighted significant declines in critical areas such as health, education, primary production, law and justice, transport, and governance. These declines are directly attributable to the failure of many provinces submitting their required reports, which are essential for identifying and addressing these issues proactively.""
Provincial governments that have been consistent in submitting performance reports from 2014 to 2023 are East New Britain, Enga, Gulf, Hela, Manus, Milne Bay, New Ireland, Simbu, Sandaun, and Western.
“I commend the provincial governments that are cooperating with us.
“But it is very disappointing to see that, year after year, certain provincial governments continue to ignore this requirement as demanded by the OLPLLG. Yet, these very same people continue to call for National Government to acquit funds, knowing very well they themselves haven't acquitted their provincial government spending. National Government cannot fully acquit without all provincial government's acquittals.”
“This culture of negligence and lack of transparency is very concerning. It erodes confidence in our provincial leadership and the provincial government mechanism. Regular performance reports are necessary for effective monitoring and evaluation, and good service delivery to all our people in the provinces.”
“In line with our government’s efforts to devolve powers to provinces, reports are vital as this exercise has to be evidence-based according to performance. Provincial leaders cannot demand for more powers when they are not doing the basic work of demonstrating they are properly managing their provinces.”
“Let me remind all provincial leaders that even if the Supreme Court has invalidated Section 51 - 53 of OLPLLC on suspension of provincial governments, it does not prevent the administrative or financial audits of, or accountability measures against individual leaders,” said Minister Eoe."
Ronnie Lavai’s dreams of being an engineer,12/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3959,"Motivated by family and set to graduate with a National Certificate (NC)2 in Maintenance, Fitting and Machining (MFM) at Don Bosco Technical School (DBTS) in November, it is 24-year-old Ronnie Lavai’s hope to be a certified engineer one day.
“I have a son of my own, an eight-month-old baby. He is the main reason why I’m here; I mean my mum was first, but now I do it for both of them,” he says smiling.
With roots from West Kerema, Ihu LLG, Gulf Province, Ronnie was born and raised in Port Moresby and is the second last of six brothers and sisters.
“My dad is a teacher and the principal at Kaugere Junior High School while my mum is the primary caregiver, looking after the whole family at home,” he says.
After matriculating at Kila Kila Secondary School in 2021, he was accepted to study at the PNG University of Technology but due to school fees, could not attend.
“I played basketball for two years and I even represented the country twice, in 2021 and 2022, with the Flames Basketball club,” he shares.
“I originally didn’t have any interest in playing basketball but was encouraged by the people around me and then when I started playing, everything just sort of clicked into place. I was even thinking this (basketball), might be the answer for me,” he said.
Life it seems, had other plans for him as in 2023, he decided to do a short course on basic computing at the DBTS Gabutu campus, igniting in him a passion for computing.
“I did well so I decided to stay on. I thought I would be taking computing but because they had no computing classes, they offered their trade courses and that’s how I chose MFM, since MFM deals with metals and machining,” he explains.
Ronnie is one of 80 students from the current cohort of NC2 students at DBTS under the Papua LNG TVET Scholarship program, to be sponsored by TotalEnergies EP PNG Limited (TotalEnergies), operator of the Papua LNG project.
“It’s a big help for me and my family because my dad is the sole breadwinner, providing for the family. Since the scholarship came in, it has really helped my dad a lot,” he says.
“I have really learnt a lot. I knew when I was in Grade 12 at Kila Kila Secondary school, that I wanted to be an engineer. That hasn’t changed and I haven’t thought about doing anything else, I just know I want to build, fix and repair things,” he notes letting out a small laugh.
“My brothers are doing their own thing. I’m the only one in my family, out of us boys in school, so my dad has a lot of expectations of me,” he added.
Having maintained his academic performance, the Project has continued support to him throughout his second and final year of studies. He was initially identified as applicable for the Papua LNG scholarship program when he was applying for a trade course and it had been made known that he was from Gulf.
“After I graduate, hopefully I get a job and maybe work for a while – two or three years. Just to gain the experience and after that I can apply for tradesman certificates because nowadays, those certificates are the most in demand in the technical world,” he says.
“I want to be able to provide for my family and my son. I’m sure others who are fathers and young men have the same dream,” he adds happily."
Pariwa challenges Marape to honor commitments,12/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3955,"Madang Governor, Ramsey Pariwa has challenged the Prime Minister, James Marape and his government to honor a K10 million commitment made last year to assist the displaced Manam islanders currently living in care centers in the Bogia and Sumkar districts.
Governor Pariwa made this call when addressing Manam islanders at Yassa village located at Postdam care centre two weeks ago.
Governor Pariwa was very vocal about this unfulfilled promise and blamed the National Government for failing its responsibility to assist the displaced Manam islanders.
The Madang governor openly shed tears when expressing sorrow and sympathy toward the displaced Manam islanders currently living in three care centres at Postdam and Asuramba in Bogia district and Mangem in Sumkar district.
He agreed with the president of Iabu Local Level Government, Kenny Boli that LLG funds to assist the Manam islanders was insufficient. Furthermore, the funding from Bogia district development Authority (DDA) and the Madang provincial government are also not adequate to address the many issues faced by the displaced people.
Governor Pariwa announced publicly that he is frustrated in the manner in which the Prime Minister, James Marape and the National Government had treated the displaced Manam islanders since they were evacuated to settle on the mainland with little attention by the national government.
Pariwa said the 2023 budgetary allocation for Manam islanders that is channeled to the Manam Resettlement Authority (MaRA) was K10 million. Unfortunately all these monies were not released.  A further funding allocation to Manam in 2024 was K20 million, however, to date only K4 million was released, and K16 million is still outstanding.
“From the K20 million the National Government released only K4 million to MaRA. K16 million is still outstanding and now we’re already in 2025,” Pariwa decried.
Pariwa  further noted that another 20 million was allocated in the 2025 budget for Manam.
He added that since taking office in 2023 he had seen how the National Government had been performing and noted that only paper budgets are passed, and strongly called on the prime minister to be serious about the Manam issue because the court had already declared the government’s negligence in handling the Manam issue.
Pariwa told the gathering that the government would pay K6 million upon the court’s order with interest. However, he said that amount is insufficient.
“I disagree a little to the court decision. They are supposed to give K100 million,” Pariwa said.
Pariwa challenged the Prime Minister to honor his government’s commitment during his visit to Madang on May 24, 2024 where he pledged a K10 million assistance to Manam.
“That time I challenged him that my people of Manam island need not to be living in care centres because you are not taking care of them. They are living in what looks like settlements,” Pariwa said.
“If you can take good care of foreigners arriving as asylum seekers from Australia and host them in hotels in Port Moresby, then why can’t you look after your own citizens. That’s not right and that’s not acceptable by a responsible government,” Pariwa said."
PNG 50 years ago with Colleen,11/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3953,"As the country’s 50th Independence Anniversary approaches, a 60-year-old Colleen recalls her participation in the Independence Celebrations on September 16, 1975.
Colleen, then 10 years old witnessed the Australian flag lowered one last time, and the Papua New Guinea flag raised for the very first time.
Colleen said she was selected among other students from her school, to participate in a march to celebrate this significant event in the country’s history, at what is now the Sir Hubert Murray stadium.
“I went to Gerehu Primary School. Each school was given big PNG Flags to march behind. It was such an exciting time and overwhelming (too). Everything felt so different though. People had their face painted in PNG colours. Vehicles were driving around (tooting) their horns and cheering on while we were marching.”
Colleen, a grandmother to three beautiful grandchildren, shared her thoughts on life today, over what it was like 50 years ago.
She said, “Back then when the Australian Government was still in control, food prices were low, services were better and there was a better lifestyle. Comparing that to now, so much has changed over the last 50 years. Sometimes I (think of) what it would be like if we never gained Independence.”
According to the Institute of Developing Economies, the Papua New Guinean Kina (PGK) had a relatively high value compared to the Australian dollar 5 decades ago. Food prices were generally considered low, although imported food prices did increase due to global inflation.
Colleen prays for the country, sharing that one day with the help of God, Papua New Guinea will go back to its glory days, where there was no inflation, life was easy and better services.
“There is still hope for change. I pray that the country will go back to how it was where there was no inflation, the government was transparent, no credits and many more. I am just glad I got to experience the celebration of my country’s Independence,” she said."

The former representative goalkeeper from Wairavanua village of Abau district, Central Province, is facing one count of manslaughter.
Presiding Magistrate Alex Kalandi read Nope’s charges and explained her constitutional rights before adjourning the matter to May 12th, 2024 for further mention.
Police allege in the early hours of September 29, 2024, on the Papa Lealea Road, Nope was seen driving a black 5th element Toyota Hilux double cab with the deceased  seated in the backseat of the vehicle.

“In 2019, I thought as Prime Minister, that I was steering the Government I led in the right direction for the betterment of Papua New Guineans.

He argued that allowing other leaders in PANGU Pati to take the reins could foster a more effective and responsive governance approach, particularly as the nation grapples with pressing economic and social issues.

LLG Elections Nearing,10/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3941,"As the Local Level Government election approaches, the method of voting for the LLG presidents will not be uniform across the country.
In line with the National Executive Council decision of June 2024, some provinces including Madang will have the voters elect their presidents and town mayors while other provinces will go with the old method of councilors electing a president.
Madang Provincial Electoral Manager, Sponsa Navi, the nomination fees for all LLG candidates stand at K200.
However, he thinks that the nomination fees for those vying for the president’s seat should be increased to K500 as it is a higher level compared to a town mayor and ward council members. Navi is uncertain if there will be any changes with regard to nomination fees.
He said by increasing the fees, it will deter candidates from standing unnecessarily.
“In most instances, it has become a political gimmick for several candidates being sponsored by the same person just to split votes. It is a practice commonly used in elections nowadays, hence, if fees are increased, it would likely avoid this practice,” Navi added.
Meantime, despite the Electoral Commission assuring the public that the 2025 Local Level Government elections will proceed as scheduled, no funds have been released to the provincial level yet to prepare for this important constitutional event."

The MPs expressed in a joint statement that the Marape-led government has invested significantly in the province’s education and health infrastructure, demonstrating its commitment to our province’s development.
“We acknowledge and appreciate the new Porgera arrangement, which is hoped to provide greater returns to landowners and the provincial government, benefiting the people of Enga.
“We also acknowledge that Enga Provincial Government and the National government have been working on Business Development grants, Infrastructure Development grants and resettlement of SML land owners on the Porgera mine.
“We are of the view that Sir Peter Ipatas and PM James Marape continue to address the ongoing Porgera issues.
“Therefore, we ask the Governor of Enga to return to the government.”
The four leaders further said that they do give credit where it is due and commended the partnership between the Prime Minister and Sir Peter Ipatas in bringing about progressive development in the province.
“However, we must honestly establish that Sir Peter Ipatas had independently solicited the support of the opposition of the floor of Parliament to secure his nomination on the motion of VONC without any Engan leader’s consent, except from the Member for Wabag.
“We respect the governor’s decision he made as a leader on his own right.
“We, as leaders of Enga representing our districts, have collectively decided on our own conscience in the best interest of our electorates and the province as a whole to remain with the government. We have also respectfully called on our esteemed Governor Sir Peter Ipatas to reconsider his position and return to the government to continue to implement the development programs that he initiated with Prime Minister James Marape.
“We announce our position as Engan leaders reaffirming our coalition with Prime Minister Marape’s leadership and resolve to commit to addressing electorate, provincial and national challenges.
“On behalf of our districts and the people we represent, we believe that we have made the politically and morally correct decision with patience and insight to improve Enga’s and PNG’s present situation.”
The leaders also appealed to the people of Enga and Papua New Guineans who might have different views to accept their position in this VONC and that their resolve was made on rationale and critical analysis of the present situation."
Eoe targets Wutung Border Post to Open In September,10/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3935,"The Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs (DPLGA) targets opening the long waited Wutung Border Post on 16th September 2025, coinciding with Papua New Guinea’s 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations.
Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, Soroi Eoe said, “There is no better time and no better gift to the people of Wutung than to open the long-awaited Wutung Border Post and light up their homes on Independence Day, 2025.
This project is a symbol of our commitment to improving the lives of our people and enhancing our relationship with the Republic of Indonesia.”
It is emphasized that this will bring benefits to the people of Wutung and the greater West Sepik Province and further strengthen the bond between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.
To ensure the successful delivery of this project, an Inter-Agency Border Development Working Committee has been established, chaired by DPLGA Secretary Philip Leo. This committee plays a critical role in coordinating preparations for the opening of the Border Post.
It includes representatives from PNG Customs, Immigration and Citizenship Authority, National Agriculture Quarantine and Inspection Authority, Department of Works and Highways, Department of Foreign Affairs, National Maritime Safety Authority, PNG Defence Force, and Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary.
The PNG Government acknowledges the invaluable support from the people and Government of the Republic of Indonesia, as well as Indonesia’s state power company Perusahaan Listrik Negara.
The extension of power lines into Wutung village is part of Indonesia’s 78th Independence Anniversary gift to the Wutung community.
This reflects their continued partnership and commitment to border communities. The Government also appreciates Indonesia’s ongoing provision of essential services such as healthcare, telecommunications, and early childhood education to the people of Wutung.
Key progress on the Wutung Border Post development includes;
•	Infrastructure Readiness: Inspections of facilities and staff housing have been completed, and refurbishments are underway.
•	Water Supply: The construction of a water reservoir is progressing, with commissioning expected by July 2025.
•	Electricity Connection: Efforts are ongoing to resolve delays in connecting power from the Indonesian grid to border facilities, schools, and village homes.
A budget of K10 million has been allocated to ensure the project is completed on time, with inter-agency coordination driving progress.
The opening of the Wutung Border Post will not only enhance border management and trade but also deliver critical services to the people of Wutung, improving their quality of life."

Eagles Show Faith ahead of Season,09/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3929,"After recording their first national rugby league title win in 25 years last year (2024), the Wamp Nga Mount Hagen Eagles are set to defend their title in the 2025 season.
The Eagles’ inspirational skipper, Henry Wan Noki, said the Eagles have retained most of its players who won the competition in 2024. They are in good spirit heading into this year’s competition. He made this statement at Digicel ExxonMobil Cup 2025 Competition launch in Port Moresby.
The Eagles captain is confident they are still a strong side despite a few off-season setbacks.
One of their biggest loss is Lynchill Kiap, who was rewarded with a Hunters selection. He made his debut last weekend. Kiap was a key member in the Eagles spine. His service out from the dummy half proved critical. However, the Eagles captain said the team is intact and will do well this competition.
“I think 80% of the boys from last are still intact. Only a few of the boys have left and joined other franchise clubs but the core group of the boys are still intact so we are looking forward a better season this year,” said Noki.
Despite showing a lot of confidence in the team, questions have been raised whether the Eagles can defend their title without ex-coach, Francis Ray. Ray’s contribution was immense for the team with his invaluable experience in PNG national rugby league.
Noki, who didn’t want to reveal the name of the franchise’s new coach, instead said the new coach has been involved in rugby league with a number of franchise clubs before and would fit in well with the club culture.
“We have a new coach; our last year coach has left. And as players, nothing changes for us,” Noki said. “Our new coach has been with other franchises and involved with rugby league teams before and has got experience. Our Eagles system and culture from last year remains and the new coach will blend with our existing culture and system.”
The Digicel ExxonMobil Cup competition kicks off this weekend in Port Moresby with the grand final rematch between the Eagles and Hela Wigmen."

Toroama disgusted,09/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3919,"The recent circulation of the AI-generated video showing an altercation between Autonomous Region of Bougainville President Ishmael Toroama and Prime Minister James Marape has caused disgust.
Toroama urged the public, especially content creators and users of emerging technologies, to reflect on the ethical implications of their digital actions and also made a call to NICTA to get to the bottom of this video.
President Toroama advised that such reckless misuse of artificial intelligence and social media platforms has the potential to damage the hard-earned trust and mutual respect between Bougainville and Papua New Guinea.
He has called on social media platforms and regulatory bodies to take more robust steps in curbing the spread of misleading AI-generated content.
“This video is not only false and malicious—it is dangerous.”
“It threatens to undermine the ongoing spirit of dialogue, peace, and cooperation that both our governments have worked tirelessly to build,” President Toroama said.
He added that the viral video, which falsely portrays a confrontation between the two leaders, has been widely shared on social media, prompting public confusion and concern. President Toroama emphasized that while freedom of expression is a democratic value, it is also a privilege that carries responsibility.
He shared that while freedom of expression is a democratic value, it is also a privilege that carries responsibility.

PM Marape commends Speaker for adhering to Court’s ruling,08/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3916,"Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed today’s special sitting of Parliament, commending the Speaker and Members of Parliament for complying with the Supreme Court’s directive and setting a strong precedent for future leaders of Papua New Guinea.
Marape acknowledged that today’s sitting was convened under the direction of the Supreme Court and with the leadership of the Speaker, demonstrating respect for the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution.
“Parliament convened today not by defying the Court, but by upholding it. I commend the Speaker for allowing the sitting to proceed in compliance with the Court’s order.
“This moment stands as an important reminder that no one – including Members of Parliament – is above the law,” Marape said.
The Prime Minister reflected on the events of 2011, when a previous Parliament failed to honour a Supreme Court ruling that restored the government of the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Thomas Somare.
“We must never repeat the mistakes of 2011. Back then, Members of Parliament took actions that undermined the authority of the Supreme Court and eroded our democratic principles. Laws were passed that, in some instances, made the father of our nation a stranger in his own Parliament. That must never happen again,” he said.
Marape stressed that in a country as politically, culturally and economically diverse as Papua New Guinea, leaders must be seen to uphold the law.
“The Courts interpret the law. Parliament legislates. Each institution has its place in our democracy, and when the Supreme Court speaks, we must comply. If there are uncertainties, the law provides avenues for appeal and clarification. But we do not defy the Court – we honour it.”"
Criminal charges against Act NOW manager dismissed,08/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3915,"The Waigani District Court on Monday struck out a criminal charge of identity theft against ACT NOW Campaign Manager, Eddie Tanago.
Presiding Magistrate Paul Puri Nii struck out the matter due to lack of evidence.
A prominent civil society advocate, Tanago was arrested and charged by police in December 2024 following a complaint made by the managing director of the PNG Forest Authority.
This was after ACT NOW had hosted a public seminar highlighting the abuse of Forest Clearing Authorities by foreign-owned logging companies who use the licences as a cover for large-scale illegal logging.
The charge against Tanago alleged that he had committed identity theft by reposting on social media an advertisement for an FM100 talk-back show where the Managing Director was due to appear and which included his photograph.
Tanago said he is delighted that the court has dismissed the charge against him and thanked his family and all those who have supported his fight for justice.
He has also expressed his gratitude to his lawyer, Carlos Tsora from Posman Kua Asi Lawyers.
Tanago said the criminal charge against him has only reinforced his determination to speak out against corruption, widespread illegal logging and the abuse of FCA licences.
He also says the criminal charge against him was a further example of the growing use of Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation (SLAPP) lawsuits in PNG.
SLAPP lawsuits are a misuse of the legal system by people in positions of power who want to silence their critics through intimidation and unwarranted but costly legal proceedings. While common in some overseas countries, SLAPPS have until recently been rare in PNG.
In 2024, ACT NOW was the victim of two civil SLAPP lawsuits brought by Malaysian logging companies trying to prevent the circulation of reports about their logging activities. Neither of those lawsuits was successful.
Tanago said the dismissal of the case against him is another win for freedom of speech and democracy in Papua New Guinea."
VoNC process underway,08/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3913,"Prime Minister James Marape has confirmed that the process under Section 145(1)(b) of the Constitution is now in motion, with the Notice of the Motion of No Confidence tabled today.
“In accordance with the Constitution, Parliament will reconvene next Tuesday to deliberate on the Motion of No Confidence. This is democracy in action. I urge all citizens to respect the process and allow it to unfold without interference.”
The Prime Minister further appealed to all public servants to remain loyal to their duties and refrain from engaging in political commentary or activity.
“I urge all public servants: Keep your political views at home. When you report to work, be loyal to your role as a servant of the people. Remain productive. Historically, Motions of No Confidence have disrupted the public service.
We cannot allow that to happen again,” he said.
He cited the instability that plagued Papua New Guinea from 1975 to 2002, during which the average lifespan of a government was just two and a half years, leading to poor economic growth and a weakened public service.
“It wasn’t until the Organic Law on Political Parties and Candidates was introduced in 2001 that we experienced stability under the Somare Government. That gave our economy space to grow. We must not return to the instability of the past.”
Marape further reaffirmed his commitment to unity, the Constitution, and democratic values.
“As we move towards 2027, I urge all Papua New Guineans to respect our Constitution, our Courts, and the democratic process. If you have concerns, express them through your vote – not by undermining the institutions that hold our nation together.”
“Next week, either I or Sir Peter Ipatas will be Prime Minister. Regardless of the outcome, I call on the public service to stay focused, and on our people to remain united.”"

Magisterial services lack capacity,08/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3910,"Papua New Guinea’s magisterial services lack the capacity to deliver, says the NCD Senior Provincial Magistrate Billy Pidu.
Pidu said this during the National Development Forum on law and order hosted by the Consultative Implementation and Monitoring Council recently.
He said the magisterial services lack capabilities in manpower, outdated laws that do not deliver service to the people, and funding constraints are some of the factors hindering progress of the magisterial services.
Pidu elaborated that the need for having more magistrates is a big factor, however, the process of employing more magistrates often is slow because lawyers have to undergo intensive training to be qualified before they are sworn in as magistrates. Training lawyers comes with funding, which the magisterial services often are unable to meet.
He said the need for effective ICT, such as the amendment of the electronic case management system, needs to be thoroughly looked into because the system is not functioning.
The Magistrate added that magisterial services play an important role in the law and justice sector, therefore, it must be properly funded and resourced to perform its duty."

Police officer receives tough penalty,07/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3901,"A convicted police officer was given two weeks to pay a K2,500 court fine after being found guilty of having methamphetamine, failure to do so may result in imprisonment.
District Court Magistrate Paul Puri Nii ordered Constable Kerry Palme, 33 years old from Tambul’s Kerepia village in Western Highlands, to pay a K2,500 court fine by April 21st. Failure to do so may result in a six months imprisonment.
Nii issued this order today, after hearing submission on sentence from the defendant and the police prosecution.
It was alleged that on August 9th, 2023, between 2 pm and 3pm, police escorted Palme’s wife, Flora Singol, to the Vadavada settlement at the rental place to collect her belongings.
At the house, a policeman allegedly noticed that the property was turned into a mini penthouse with implements used for controlled substances connected in a way to cater to mass consumption of methamphetamine.
The prosecution submitted that the defendant pays the maximum penalty of K5,000 or six months imprisonment, due to the substance containing less than 10 grams.
The defendant has asked for the court's leniency due to the substance not being above 10 grams, and is categorized under simple possession due to it being weighted 0.2 grams.
“I considered both arguments and also considered the time taken in the administration of justice since the offence occurred in 2023.
“My opinion is that the offence of having in possession of controlled substance has been increasing lately in the force. Therefore, I will impose a tough penalty. Giving the maximum penalty of K5,000 and 6 months imprisonment. Six months will be suspended, but the K5,000 will be paid by the defendant. K2,500 will come out of the defendant's bail money. Therefore, the defendant will pay K2,500 as court fine within the period of two weeks, failure to do so may result in 6 months imprisonment,” Nii ordered."
Police reduce hired vehicle expense,07/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3900,"The Royal PNG Constabulary (RPNGC) has always been scrutinised on its excessive spending on hired vehicles, and the lack of transparency in payment to hired vehicle firms.
With the handing over of 45 new police vehicles to the Special Services Division on Saturday, April 5th, the Minister of Internal Security, Peter Tsiamalili Jnr, emphasised that almost K30 million is “being saved on hired vehicles”.
Speaking at Top Town Lae after the event, he described it as a “big save”, adding that the police department will continue with the re-fleeting, leading to another K30 million being saved.
In the next four years, the constabulary should have an excess of K120 million that could be spent on police accommodation instead.
“The lack of priority by past government has placed the police department in a position where they had no choice but to hire vehicles,” he stated.
“And because they couldn’t adequately replace vehicles at the start of every year, they used to get vehicles on credit, and then allow the national government, or Department of Finance, pay those hired vehicles at the end of the year. And it was too costly.”
Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, expressed similar sentiments, outlining that vehicles were hired out of necessity due to the lack of re-fleeting program for the police force.
“We have seen that issue and what we are doing now, to save cost, government has now budgeted to re-fleet,” said Rosso.
“We have to re-fleet nearly 800 vehicles in the RPNGC.
“We have already acquired 130 under the national government police department; 130 vehicles were delivered and distributed last year. This year, another 130 is being received, as you can see, the 45 vehicles that were distributed outside.
“Forty-one goes to the mobile squad in the highlands; they call them the Highlands Mobile Group and then the Northern Mobile Group. And then the New Guinea Islands Mobile Group. Those three mobile groups will have vehicle replacements and the Southern Mobile Group will have the vehicle replacement very soon.”
Rosso said the re-fleeting program will move on to general policing, the Criminal Investigation Division and other sectors of the police force until all fleet have been replaced.
This is similar to the manpower boost that the Constabulary is currently undergoing through recruitment and training exercises."
Country needs good people: MP,07/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3898,"Our country is in short supply of upstanding citizens.
Menyamya MP, Solen Loifa, encouraged students to learn as much as they can, and aim to be good leaders whose sole focus will be on serving their people.
Loifa, who is a first-time MP, hails from one of the most neglected rural districts of Morobe Province.
Through hard work and dedication, he managed to graduate with a degree in economics from the University of Papua New Guinea, and he is now developing his district as their political representative. He was able to achieve all these through education, and especially learning to be a better person.
Speaking at a number of education project launches and ground-breaking for Wau-Waria district on Friday, March 28th, Loifa encouraged students at the Grace Memorial Secondary School, in Wau, to not only learn as much as they can, but aim to be upstanding citizens.
“The government has invested in free education, and your political leader has also given funding to send you to school,” he told parents and students.
“Our country is crying for good men and good women. How are we going to identify people with good characters? When you come to school, learn how to be good men and women so that our country can be in good hands tomorrow.
“A lot of issues we are seeing in the country today are not because of shortage of manpower or a lack of educated people. It is because we need good men and good women. So, my challenge to you, young people, when you are in school and learning, aim to be good men and women that can change our communities for the better.”
The Menyamya MP and his counterpart from Finschhafen, Rainbo Paita, were invited to Wau-Waria to officiate at the opening of a new 4-in-1 Grace Memorial Secondary School teachers’ house, the opening of a new 4-in-1 classroom building for Wau Primary School and the groundbreaking of a new staff house for Grace Memorial, a new science lab, a new FODE Centre and a Technical and Vocational Education and Training Centre.
Despite being a district that is only two years old – after its separation from Bulolo in 2022 – Wau-Waria’s rapid growth in infrastructure, education and health has been attributed to its transparent and visionary political leadership."
"PNG’s judiciary receives over 5,000 legal textbooks",07/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3897,"The New South Wales Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has donated over 5,000 legal textbooks to support Papua New Guinea’s law and justice sector.
About 5,326 legal textbooks were supplied through a 20ft shipping container and received by the Independent Commission Against Corruption legal team, who then presented it to the National and Supreme Court Registrar at the court's premises on Monday, 7th April.
When presenting the legal textbooks, the ICAC Executive Director Legal, Belinda Hughes, said the donation aims to boost the knowledge and capabilities of PNG’s legal fraternity.
“Resources are so important for legal practitioners, and it is very expensive to afford, so we are grateful to be a part of this donation,” she said.
Hughes said the New South Wales Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW DPP) has also expressed support in sharing video training materials, which will be made available at the end of this week.
“The videos consist of 80 training videos about money confiscation, asset recovery, and advocacy in general. It will be made available to other agencies such as the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, Office of Public Prosecutor, and the Department of Justice and Attorney General.
Hughes added that NSW DPP will be sending three lawyers over for training by August of this year to undertake training.
She said that the donation and the training are funded by the NSW DPP.
ICAC Deputy Commissioner for Prevention and Corporate Graham Gill thanked the NWS DPP for their kind support, which will enable growth in the knowledge-sharing space of PNG’s law and justice sector.
“We recognized that the law and justice sector need support, and we at ICAC will ensure that this support is provided to lift the standard of legal services across the country,” Gill said.
National and Supreme Court Registrar, Ian Augerea said the law and justice sector in PNG lacks adequate legal textbooks and legal training, so this support will assist the legal sector in this regard.
“I am thankful on behalf of not only the judiciary but the rest of the law and justice agencies. I will be inviting liberals from other organizations to come forward and share the distribution of these books.
“Books are important in terms of knowledge sharing, and I’m sure our lawyers will make good use of these books to guide their practice as legal officers of PNG’s law and justice sector,” Augerea said."
Biaru road blocked due to misunderstanding,07/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3896,"A misunderstanding of the word “bypass” created a volatile situation at Biaru, in Morobe’s Wau-Waria district, on Saturday, April 5th.
Villagers of Wisini, in the Wau Rural LLG, were led to believe that the construction of a new bypass – away from Wara Biaru – would mean that they will miss out on government services and benefits that they are currently enjoying along the old district road.
In frustration, they prevented a convoy from the district headquarters, including media personnel, from continuing to a ground breaking program in Biaru that would see the construction of a number of road projects within the area. The proposed projects are Biaru Kunai-Taurins Road and Tori-Korua Road.
Their issue lies with the bypass, which is the 3km Biaru Kunai-Taurins Road.
The people of Ward 17, including their councillor, George Kaia, would not let the vehicles through until the local MP, Marsh Narewec, addresses their grievance.
About 25 minutes after the first convoy was stopped, Narewec arrived at Wisini and was quickly briefed by the district administrator and chief executive officer, John Orebut, on the situation.
“What are you all afraid of and you’re protesting about ‘no bypass’? the MP asked the group. “Who is this scared person in Wisini-Kasangare? You think this road will bypass you all? You already have a school here. Should I remove it and give it to someone else?
“We have plans to build a coffee factory in Kasangare; are we bypassing you? Small minds. Your leader, ‘Kumul blo speis’, knows,” he said, referring to a popular moniker given to him in relation to his technology company, Kumulsoft.
“That primary school will become a junior high school, and possibly a secondary school. Why would I waste resources to cut a new road to Kasangare? Is it for vehicles or people? We spent millions of Kina to build a road for vehicles to pass through. Do not be afraid. Services will reach you.”
Narewec and his team continued to their program, then returned to Wisini in the evening to listen to their concerns.
There, the Ward 17 leaders highlighted that the current road was built in 1986, and the people there have been enjoying its benefits since. The current population, which is over 3,000 people, are anxious that if the bypass starts at Kunai, everything will be rerouted to that area.
However, Narewec gave the assurance that services will still flow, and he berated the councillor for not consulting with the district about the bypass.

MPs urged to make the right decisions,07/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3891,"The Catholic Professional Society of Papua New Guinea, on behalf of the churches, is calling on the political leaders to make a decisive decision when Parliament resumes on April 8th.
Catholic Professional Society (CPS) President Paul Harricknen said that should there be a need to change the government, the leaders must consider changing the government.
He said the churches can only hope that the MPs do the right thing, exercise conscience vote and from their hearts for the good of the people and not for their political survival and expedience.
“They must vote honestly from their conscious and their hearts. If there is a need for a change in government, so be it. We can only hope and pray that our leaders do the best for the people.
“Our appeal to the MPs is that we have a national crisis that needs to be addressed through good leadership. Therefore, they must consider changing the government and choose the right leaders who will carry the country forward for the betterment of our people.
Harricken said the escalation of violence and inflation affecting our people are some of the causes of poor leadership."
NEC approves Korea model for rural development,07/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3890,"The Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs (DPLGA), Soroi Eoe has announced a landmark decision by the National Executive Council (NEC) to adopt Korea’s renowned Saemaul Undong (SMU) rural development model as a cornerstone of Papua New Guinea’s rural transformation strategy.
Following a successful 13-year pilot in the Eastern Highlands Province (EHP), the government has approved the expansion of the SMU model to five additional provinces, marking a significant step toward empowering rural communities and driving sustainable change across the nation.
The Saemaul Undong, or New Village Movement, is a proven community-driven development approach that propelled South Korea from one of the world’s poorest nations—an aid recipient in the aftermath of war—to a global economic powerhouse and donor country within 50 years. Launched in the 1970s, SMU transformed rural Korea by fostering a mindset of diligence, self-help, and cooperation, enabling communities to take ownership of their development. Today, PNG stands to benefit from this inspiring model as its seek to uplift its rural population and bridge the urban-rural divide.
Minister Eoe said this is more than a development program—it’s a mindset change.
“The Saemaul Undong model teaches us that real progress begins when our people take full ownership of their future. It’s about empowering communities to identify their needs, harness their resources, and work together for lasting change. After 13 years of piloting in the Eastern Highlands, we’ve seen its potential firsthand, and now we’re ready to take it nationwide,” he said.
By embracing SMU, PNG aims to replicate Korea’s success story, fostering self-reliance and collective action to improve livelihoods, infrastructure, and opportunities in rural areas. The model’s emphasis on community participation aligns with PNG’s vision of inclusive growth, where every citizen plays a role in building a stronger, more prosperous nation.
Minister Eoe extended heartfelt gratitude to the Marape/Rosso government for its visionary leadership and unwavering support in championing this initiative.
“On behalf of the people I wish to thank Prime Minister James Marape and Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso for their dedication to rural development and for recognizing the transformative power of the Saemaul Undong model. Their approval through the NEC paves the way for a new era of progress in our provinces,” he stressed.
This announcement builds upon PNG’s long-standing efforts to strengthen rural service delivery through community-driven development approaches.
DPLGA has been at the forefront of such transformative initiatives, including the Rural Service Delivery Project (RSDP), which has successfully demonstrated how communities can lead and sustain their own development through active participation and ownership.
Like the RSDP, the adoption of the SMU model reflects the government’s commitment to establishing effective mechanisms that reach rural populations, ensuring that development efforts are impactful and sustainable.
As PNG embarks on this ambitious expansion, the government will work closely with local leaders, communities, and international partners, including the Republic of Korea, to ensure the successful implementation of SMU.
Minister Eoe says this announcement is especially meaningful as it coincides with Papua New Guinea’s 50th Independence Anniversary.
“As the nation celebrates half a century of sovereignty, the adoption of the Saemaul Undong model symbolizes a renewed commitment to self-determination and nation-building.
“The golden jubilee of independence is not only a time to honor our past achievements but also a pivotal moment to chart an ambitious course for the future—one where empowered rural communities drive our National Vision of a smarter, stronger, healthier, wealthier, and more prosperous Papua New Guinea by 2050,” Minister Eoe concluded."
Lae Academy aims high,07/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3889,"The Lae Academy's U15 male, U17 male, and U18 open female teams are determined to make a strong impression this year, aiming to replicate the success of their U19 academy boys, who claimed the inaugural 2024 PNGNRL Bid tournament major title.

Miall noted the team's commitment, hard work, and discipline displayed over the past five weeks, stating they are now ready to showcase their skills and energy on the field. Lae has a rich history of producing talented athletes through its school rugby league programs, long before the PNGNRL Bid initiative was introduced.
The Lae Academy U15 male team will kick off its campaign on Monday against host Goroka, followed by a match later in the day against Mt. Hagen."
Pundari backs Marape,06/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3885,"A senior leader from Enga Province has shown support for the leadership of Prime Minister James Marape when Parliament reconvenes on Tuesday, April 8, 2025.
Member for Kompiam Ambum, Sir John Pundari in a statement said the leaders in the country have supported and elected Prime Minister James Marape numerous times through votes of no confidence.
Sir John said stability is crucial for the country right now as we only have two years to go before the National elections in 2027.
“With only two years left before the next general elections, it's essential to stand by Marape. The people will decide who they want as their next Prime Minister through the ballot box.
“As a senior brother to Marape, I'll prioritize my district's and the country's interests over personal interests, standing firm with Marape and offering advice whenever needed,” he said.
Sir John Pundari stated that any leader who aspires to change the current regime must be free of systemic corruption and thievery to eradicate corruption in the country; individuals who embody these same traits are particularly unfit for the office of the Prime Minister.
“Leaders with authoritarian tendencies, like Idi Amin of Uganda and Saddam Hussein of Iraq in their provinces or regions are unfit to govern a democratic nation like Papua New Guinea.
“Those who exploit conflicts for personal gain or rejoice in destruction and loss of life are faceless and unfit for public office.
“A leader who cannot unite their people for stability and peace, or unite fellow leaders from the same province, cannot effectively unite a country.
“True leadership requires authenticity, humility, and a willingness to prioritize citizens’ well-being.”"
Constitutional institutions must step up,06/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3884,"The Catholic Professional Society of Papua New Guinea has called on the constitutional institutions such as the Ombudsman Commission, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the Royal PNG Constabulary, and the Public Prosecutors Office to do their job diligently and not to be compromised with politicians.
Catholic Professional Society (CPS) President Paul Harricknen said there is too much politicization of the public service institution, resulting in the institutions being politically compromised from doing their duty faithfully and freely.
“There is a lot of misconduct by the politicians, and it is the responsibility of the Ombudsman Commission to deal with those people, but they get away, so what is Ombudsman Commission doing?
“ICAC, on the other hand, was put to fight corruption, but we do not see corruption going down; it keeps increasing.
“The increase in crime and corruption are escalating and with the recent amendment of laws passed by the government, questions whether the RPNGC and Public Solicitors office are working to serve the people or are compromising with the politicians to amend these laws that are not in the interest of the people.
“These institutions belong to the people; therefore, the people have the right to question their accountability.
“These officers must understand and implement their powers, and that is to make thorough investigations when heard about a corruption information. They must not wait for complaints, rather, they must initiate their investigations,” he said.
Harricknen commented following the call made by Cardinal Sir John Ribat for the law enforcement agencies and institutions to investigate, charge, and prosecute MPs and public office holders who are caught in acts of corrupt practices, stealing, and misappropriation of public funds."
Heart screening program commences,06/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3882,"Operation Open Heart (OOH) Foundation has commenced its Provincial Paediatric Heart Patients Screening Program for the year, starting in Manus Province with 15 patients screened. Two have been identified to undergo heart surgery – one open heart and the other, closed heart.
Senior Paediatrician Dr Diana Olita from the National Department of Health says although thirty (30) patients were scheduled to undergo the screening, only fifteen were able to make it on time to meet the Children’s Heart Screening team this week.
The others have missed out due to bad weather conditions as it’s been raining for the past week, worsening the already poor road conditions.
The team returning from Manus on Wednesday, 2 April 2025, were met at the Jacksons Domestic Terminal by Air Niugini Chief Executive Officer Gary Seddon and Chief Commercial Officer David Glover, OOH Foundation staff, and Ambassadors from the Valley Hunters Rugby Union Football Club.
CEO Seddon underscored Air Niugini’s decade-long support for tor the work of the Foundation, stating, “We will do anything we can to make that program just a little bit more successful. And it remains our absolute pleasure to be involved and we will continue to do so.”
Air Niugini in 2024 commenced ticket sponsorship for the Children’s Heart Screening team. This support enabled the team to travel to ten provinces screening 725 children. Thirty-three (33) children have been identified as needing open heart surgery and are awaiting the visit of the Operation Open Heart team, while 25 children were identified as needing closed heart surgery.
Last year, only nine had closed heart surgery done. From the remaining sixteen, one was flown into Port Moresby last week Friday by Air Niugini to undergo the surgery through a commitment made by the airline to ensure that all these children travel to Port Moresby for treatment.
“We look forward to the 15 children to come down and have that operation,” Seddon stated.
Air Niugini Chief Commercial Officer David Glover added, “New lease of life for these children. Everybody deserves that second chance, and we’re happy to play our small part bringing them into Port Moresby for the operation.”
The Foundation’s Ambassadors from the Valley Hunters Rugby Union Football Club were also present. Willi Genia said, “We’re very privileged to establish a partnership with the (Operation) Open Heart Foundation. We are very much part of the initiative around pushing a healthy lifestyle and healthy living to prevent things like heart disease.”
Genia added that a gala dinner will be hosted on June 21st to raise funds for the Foundation.
“We’re very proud to be aligned with you guys (Foundation) and also with Air Niugini and all the good things you guys are doing as a part of the foundation. Very grateful to be here and be a part of it,” Genia said.
Next week, the Children’s Heart Screening team will travel to Tabubil, Western Province, to conduct heart screening."
"Yangoru-Saussia, first district to establish National Court Services",06/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3881,"In a historic moment on Friday, the 4th of April, the National Judiciary Staff Services (NJSS) and the Yangoru-Saussia District Development Authority (DDA) signed an Agreement to partner to build a National courthouse in the district headquarters of Yangoru-Saussia. This will make Yangoru-Saussia the first district in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to have a National Court House with a Resident Judge to be based in the district.
Both parties have agreed to partner and improve judicial services in the Yangoru-Saussia District and to extend the services to other districts in the Greater Sepik Region, including Maprik, Wosera-Gawi, Angoram, Ambunti-Drekikir, and Lumi and Nuku in Sandaun Province.
The project including the National Court House and the houses for the Judge, Magistrate and other judicial staff will be delivered at the cost of K10 million — counter funding of K5 million each by both parties.
The Minister for International Trade and Investment and Yangoru-Saussia MP Richard Maru said, “This is a historic achievement and partnership. I am pleased to announce that K5 million counterpart funding from the Yangoru-Saussia DDA is ready and will be immediately released as soon as Accounts are open next week.”
He further stated, “One of the biggest issues that has been raised in this country by the Law Society and the public is the lack of respect for the rule of law. This is because criminals are not brought to justice. To improve access to judicial services in our district, the Yangoru-Saussia DDA is investing K5 million. We are very keen to have a residential Judge to ensure that justice is dispensed to the Greater Sepik Region. These services will complement the Mobile Barracks which is about to be completed and the District Court which is already established in Yangoru Station.""
""This is a great step, and I thank the Chief Justice and his management for this historic partnership. We are extremely thankful that we have been trusted to be granted the first district in PNG's history to have a Resident National Court Judge. It is even more historical when this partnership is being announced in the 50th year of our Independence Anniversary.
“I want to assure the Chief Justice and his team and the Secretary for NJSS and his team that my DDA will go all out to support this very important project, not only with funding but we will allocate land to build the houses for the Judge, Magistrate and all the judiciary staff who will be based in the district,"" said Minister Maru.
""With the funding to be immediately made available, we expect NJSS to finalize the design, and we want to go out on tender as soon as practical for the entire project,"" added Minister Maru.
The Secretary for NJSS, Nichodemus Mosoro, on behalf of the NJSS, gave assurance to support the people of Yangoru-Saussia District with counter funding of K5 million for this project.
Secretary Mosoro said, “Having a permanent presence of a judicial officer, be it a judge or a magistrate, will streamline the whole criminal justice administration process.
“The rule of law is a key enabler for development to happen in that space.”
Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Magistrate Josephine Kilage on behalf of the Chief Magistrate thanked the district under Minister Maru’s leadership, stating, “In having this inclusive approach to developing the capacity of the judicial officers with both the higher court and lower court within your district, it shows that we will all be working together lock step to make sure that we deliver, the issues on the ground in terms of case dispensation. Thank you so much for the assistance given and the continued assistance given to the district court, not only today but in the two terms in office. And I thank you for that support, on behalf of the Chief Magistrate.”"
Bad Weather Disrupts Competitions,06/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3880,"A few major sporting competitions in Port Moresby have cancelled their games for this weekend following the ongoing afternoon rain in the past few days.
The sporting competitions affected were the Pepsi Capital Rugby Union (CRU) and the Isuzu T20 Smash men’s cricket tournament.
The CRU Organizing committee said, “We regrettably advice that due to the territorial rainfall experienced last night in the city, the Venue Management Team officials closed for this weekend. All games have been cancelled. We will go straight into round two next weekend.”
While this as the case for Bava Park where CRU and KCK Rigo Rice Cup competitions are held, the Amini Cricket Park is also not in good shape; hence; Cricket PNG in consultation with its sponsor Boroko Motors have decided to postponed their tournament.
Cricket PNG through the media statement said, the tournament was originally scheduled to begin on Friday, 4 April, will now be pushed back to May, to ensure player safety and preserve ground conditions for top-level T20 cricket action.
The revised plan will see Isuzu Women’s T20 Smash to proceed as scheduled from 25 April to 4 May, followed by the rescheduled Men’s T20 Smash from 9 May onwards. A new match schedule and calendar of events will be released for the games.
Cricket PNG said the delay is disappointing, but the safety and quality of the playing environment remain a top priority. They are hoping for friendly weather conditions so that they can get the women’s tournament underway."

Marape Gives Members Room to Reflect Before VONC,05/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3873,"Prime Minister James Marape left for Brisbane yesterday, April 4th 2025 and will spend the duration of the weekend there to attend a series of high-level engagements focused on strengthening Papua New Guinea’s partnerships in sports and education, while also providing Members of Parliament space to reflect freely ahead of the upcoming motion of no confidence.
Prime Minister Marape said his decision to travel is also intended to demonstrate respect for the democratic process and to avoid any perception of exerting undue influence on Members of Parliament.
“There is much political noise in the air, with accusations labelling me a control freak or a dictator,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“To respect the integrity of the process, I am deliberately stepping back from close proximity to Members of Parliament so that they can decide freely, without pressure, what is best for the country.”
He said this was not a time for campaigning, but for reflection and fair judgment.
“After six years as Prime Minister, I am placing my record before Parliament and stepping back. I’ve told my caucus, my coalition partners, and all Members of the Pangu Pati that I will not be actively present among them this week,” he said.
“Instead, I encourage them to assess both candidates fairly — myself, and the alternative presented by the Opposition,  Sir Peter Ipatas.”
The Prime Minister acknowledged Sir Peter as a senior and experienced leader, and emphasised that Members of Parliament must now exercise their judgment based on conscience and national interest.
During his visit, Prime Minister Marape will be the special guest of the Brisbane Broncos at this weekend’s NRL match against the Wests Tigers — a sign of growing interest in developing a deeper partnership with Papua New Guinea, especially in light of the incoming PNG-based NRL team.
“This is part of ongoing efforts to build strong working relationships in sport as we prepare to introduce our own team into the NRL,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“I’m honoured by the Broncos’ invitation and the opportunity to advance this important national initiative.”
He will also meet with officials from the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) this afternoon to discuss potential cooperation in education, research, and technology development.
“These meetings are vital for our ongoing nation-building efforts across sectors,” he said.
“While I’m away, I want to reaffirm that leadership is not about micromanagement. Contrary to political rhetoric, I trust my ministers and team to continue their duties. Since 2020, we’ve upheld open parliamentary processes during all motions of no confidence — with no lockdowns.”
The Prime Minister highlighted his government’s commitment to equitable service delivery.
“Contrary to some claims, we have been fair to all MPs — both in Government and Opposition. DSIP and PSIP funds have been distributed without bias. A good example is Hon. James Donald, who opened a new terminal funded from DSIP allocations my government approved.”
He reaffirmed that he will return early next week but may also take additional time away once the motion is formally placed on notice.
“I value taking short periods of reflection during moments of political pressure. It helps me reset and return focused. More importantly, I want the country to know that Members of Parliament are making their own choices, freely and in good faith.”"
PM responds to US tariff,05/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3872,"While PNG respects the decision by the United States to impose a 10 per cent tariff on all Papua New Guinean exports into the American market, Prime Minister James Marape says PNG will look to other markets if the US market becomes more difficult due to this tariff.
Prime Minister Marape said today that the Government had been formally briefed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and recognises that the tariff imposition is a decision made under the current U.S. administration’s domestic trade priorities.
“As a sovereign nation, we respect the right of the United States Government to make trade policy decisions in accordance with its national interest,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“We have no issue with this development and do not intend to retaliate with counter tariffs, as others may have done. Instead, we reaffirm our long-standing commitment to free and fair trade.”
The Prime Minister said that Papua New Guinea values its bilateral relationship with the United States.
“The U.S. remains one of the world’s largest free-market democracies, and Papua New Guinea shares this worldview,” he said.
“We are a democratic nation that believes in rules-based international trade. While we reserve the right to protect our domestic industries when needed, in this instance, we will not respond with hostility or punitive measures.”
Prime Minister Marape noted that Papua New Guinea’s trade footprint is increasingly diversified, with strong and growing markets in Asia, Southeast Asia, the broader Pacific region, Japan, South Korea, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.
“Our trading partners in Asia - including China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and others — have treated Papua New Guinea with respect, honour, and fairness,” he said.
“These are our closest neighbours and represent proximity markets that continue to offer growing opportunities for our producers.”
“We will continue to strengthen our trade relations in Asia and the Pacific, where our produce is welcomed. If the U.S. market becomes more difficult due to this tariff, we will simply redirect our goods to markets where there is mutual respect and no artificial barriers.”
The Prime Minister concluded by reiterating PNG’s openness to all partners, including the United States, but stated clearly that the country would act in its best interests without compromising its values.
“We remain open for trade, we remain a friend to all, and we will continue to stand by our principles of cooperation, respect, and economic diplomacy.”"
Sohe District acquits DSIP funds,05/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3871,"The Sohe District Development Authority submitted its acquittal report for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 fiscal years to the Department of Implementation and Rural Development (DIRD) in Port Moresby on Thursday 03rd April.
Sohe’s Member of Parliament, Henry Amuli while presenting the reports highlighted that the district was unable to implement major projects and submit reports for 2022 and 2023 on their due dates, due to leadership instability at the district.
Amuli said while he was battling election petitions, court ordered recounts, by-election and was out of office, former District CEO and District Finance Manager have both passed on, affecting the smooth operation of the administration.
He said the district now has in place a permanent District Finance Manager and an acting CEO who are providing administrative leadership and moving things forward.
Now that the district administration team is fully operational and the presentation of the two outstanding reports of 2022 and 2023 together with part of the 2024 report marks their commitment to drive things forward, Amuli explained.
He said part of 2024 funds were received in late December so the district will submit the reports at a later date once funding is expanded on projects.
Thus much of 2024 funding for project implementations were carried forward to 2025 and they will begin to implement major impact projects soon. These projects include upgrading of district roads and opening up new links, building school and health infrastructures, building sub-stations and relocating the district headquarter to Sohe from its current location within Popondetta District.
DIRD deputy secretary, Gordon Wafimbi commended Sohe District for successfully compiling its outstanding acquittals for 2022, 2023 and 2024 fiscal years.
He described Sohe as one of the district that is always compliant in terms of reporting and commended the Member for his strong political leadership on that."
PNGDF ATW makes progress on international stage,04/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3861,"The Papua New Guinea Defence Force Air Transport Wing welcomed back its aircraft to Port Moresby on Wednesday following two weeks of training and participation at the 2025 Air show in Victoria, Australia.
This year, the PNGDF Air Transport Wing (ATW) contingent, comprising 11 pilots and engineers, flew down to Avalon with the PAC750XL aircraft to display its tactical lift capabilities.
PNGDF ATW, in partnership with the Royal Australian Air Force under the Flight of Excellence program, attended the Air show and displayed a well-rounded set of skills in the airspace, landing an award for being the Best Tanker/Transport Aircraft.
This event, being one of the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, includes static aircraft exhibitions, breathtaking aerial displays, and industry-related conferences showcasing both military and civilian aircraft from countries around the world.
ATW Commanding Officer Lt. Colonel Douglas Vavar was present to welcome the crew.
Vavar expressed deep satisfaction to the crew for presenting the PNGDF and the people of PNG on the international stage.
“The platform is for training purposes and also forms the foundation for our safety framework and other capabilities of the force,” Vavar said.
ATW Detachment Commander, Captain Cameron Hosea, who led a team of nine PNGDF personnel including Australian Airforce, said they have learnt a lot from the training and also gained a lot of experience.
Hosea said the main challenge they faced was to learn how to fly big military plans.
However, the biggest contribution they imparted to their Australian counterpart was on how to fly in the rugged settings as contries like Australia do not have rugged terrains like Papua New Guinea.
“Flying in and around terrains is what a lot of air force members do not experience as much as we do. They were keen to learn from our experiences flying in PNG, and we were keen to learn from them,” Hosea added."
No money for LLG elections,03/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3859,"With only three weeks to go before the Issue of Writs and Nominations open for the 2025 Local Level Government Elections, there is still no funding given to the Madang provincial electoral office.
The provincial election manager, Sponsa Navi, said the funding would be used for logistics and support to carry out the elections on the dates set by the Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission.
All the LLG data update has been completed with polling schedules, appointment of Returning Officials done which will be gazetted shortly and the common roll is ready as preparations wind down to await the next phase of conducting the elections.
Mr. Navi is calling on the government to fund the electoral commission so that they can receive their allocation amount to run the LLG elections. He stressed that they could not afford to delay the LLG elections again.
He said Madang needs K3.7 million, which has been submitted to the Electoral Commission. Mr. Navi states that they have also sent an additional K2.1 million submission to the Madang Provincial Government for counter funding, which is currently with the Provincial Executive Committee for endorsement.
Furthermore, there is outstanding allowances not being paid to three LLGs from last year’s common roll update, which has led them to withhold their data. Gama from the Usino Bundi, Transgogol in Ambenob and Yawar LLG in the Bogia district have withheld their data updates until payment is processed, in order to release the information to Electoral Commission.
In addition, the Madang Electoral Office is also anticipating an additional K5.3 million jointly run the By-Election for Usino Bundi district after the passing of member and Minister for Education Jimmy Uguro. Mr. Navi is requesting that money be made available so that, if need be, both elections can be carried out, killing two birds with one stone.

Unveiling of Bong’s aircraft,03/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3858,"The unveiling of a museum display on American ace Richard Bong, who flew in PNG in World War II, finally had his P-38J aircraft discovered in Madang Province last year.
The display donated by Pacific Wrecks and the Richard I. Bong Veterans Heritage Centre will now be officially seen soon at the National Museum and Arts Gallery in Port Moresby.
Richard Bong who was part of the United States Army Air Force, was America’s highest scoring ace fighter pilot of World War I, with a credit of 40 aerial victories and had most of his air combat taking place in the skies of PNG.
In 1944, Bing returned to New Guinea, flying from Nadzab and was assigned a new P-38J, which was nicknamed Marge after his girlfriend.
“Well, Richard was a famous pilot, and he scored three of his 40 aerial victories flying that airplane here in the skies over PNG. But the plane was piloted by another pilot, another American named Thomas Malone, and during his mission on March 24, 1944, the plane had mechanical issues, electrical issues, and the pilot tried to fix it, but he couldn't, so he bailed out in a parachute.
“He landed safely, was helped, and found the American soldiers nearby, was rescued, but the plane without a pilot, spun and crashed into the jungle, and it was forgotten, just like so many other wrecks and relics from World War Two, Papua New Guinea is littered with them, but this airplane has a very important history. It's connected to the most famous pilot, Richard Bong, and it's still here today in Madang province,” said Justin Taylan, founder of Pacific Wrecks.
The display is donated by Pacific Wrecks and the Richard I. Bong Veterans Heritage Center. The National Museum and Art Gallery acknowledged the partnership and its significance in the museum.
“This museum also has a partnership with the Government of Madang and finding these kinds of things, tells the historical relic and tells an important piece of history and the museum has a responsibility to bring awareness to the World War II, so we protect them. These also bring benefits like education, history and more,” said Alois Kuaso, Acting director of NMAG.
Parts of Bong’s aircraft will be brought to the museum from Madang Rai Coast and the display of the aircraft will be open for public display in a few months."
Hiri Koiari presents 2023 – 2024 Acquittals,03/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3857,"The Hiri Koiari district, one of the newly established districts in Papua New Guinea, presented its 2023-2024 acquittals to the Department of Implementation and Rural Development today.

Continuous flooding a threat to livestock,03/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3854,"The continuous heavy rain in Port Moresby and the outskirts of the city, including the Central Province, is a threat to livestock. The Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) has raised great concerns.
The LDC is appealing to the Works Department and the NCDC to promptly address a river blockage caused by debris flow from an old bridge that connects the Kinakon Road, located behind the Tiaba abattoir at 12mile just outside Port Moresby.
Managing Director Terry Koim said further flooding caused by the debris flow induced a river behind the property, posing potential risk to human and livestock livelihood, including negative impact on grazing grounds and property fencing caused by landslide triggered by flood waters and friction from large debris.
“Debris flow-induced river blockage can cause flooding which poses a threat to the health of people and animals and can increase the risk of contracting waterborne diseases, whilst ruining crops and or removing and or contaminating valuable topsoil and cause death of livestock,” he said.
Koim said there are more than 100 cattle at Tiaba being fattened for the slaughterhouse, and it is important that their grazing paddock is in good condition and has appropriate food sources to have healthy cattle that will produce good beef.
He revealed that the flooding has destroyed the grazing paddocks previously assigned to plant signal grass (‘popular forage grass, known for its vigorous growth and ability to spread quickly’) which is deemed suitable for being well-adapted to acid and neutral soils, tolerating high soil aluminum levels, and maintaining green leaf well into seasonally dry periods, making it a productive pasture for beef-grazing and finishing.
“However, after the flooding, the cattle are being forced to graze on para grass, a grass type that spreads quickly and has much unpalatable matter compared to signal grass,” he said.
“Livestock is an important agenda that has the potential to bring back so much revenue that is spent. About K900 million is spent annually, but we now have an opportunity to change this by doing downstream processing to cut down on this expenditure, hence, this matter must be dealt with accordingly.”
Koim said, after close observation and inspection, the continuous heavy rains will only add to the already growing accumulated debris and huge logs at the foot of the old bridge that now not only stands as a rotting structure and eye sore, but also as a great hazard to all livelihood in the area.
At the moment, LCD is closely monitoring the situation, as the water level has slowly subsided, however, the swift action of concerned authorities is needed, as the weather remains unpredictable."
Court dismissed allegations against Bernal No.8 director,03/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3853,"The Waigani Committal Court on Tuesday, April 1st, 2025, dismissed the allegations against the Managing Director of Bernal No.8 Limited, a developer of Graceville Estate due to lack of evidence.
Wesley Yanum 42 years old from Makendo village in Angoram of East Sepik Province was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud, one count of forgery and two counts of uttering.
Yannum employed over 200 Papua New Guineas, whose jobs were affected due to the court proceedings.  Now that the proceedings are over, is a satisfaction to these employees.
It was before the court that on February 21st, 2011, Bernal No.8, the developer company of Graceville Estate at 9 Mile in the nation's capital, was incorporated under the Companies Act with the Investment Promotion Authority (IPA). The core function of the business is real estate and property development.
Police alleged that the defendant and the complainant were the directors/shareholders of the company with 50 percent shares each. Both have a joint bank account.
Police alleged that on or around June 20th, 2023, the defendant falsely pretended to Daniel Mwadeda, a company examiner of IPA, that he was the sole director of the company. In the process, the defendant convinced and instructed the IPA officer to remove the complainant as the shareholder.
The company was re-registered without the complainants' particulars on the IPA records. Police alleged that the defendant's conduct was criminal, and subsequently, he was arrested and charged.
The issue before the court was to establish whether police evidence was satisfactory to make a prima facie case against the defendant for the four allegations against him. Prima facie in law means that based on initial evidence, a case or claim appears to be valid and sufficient unless rebutted by contrary evidence.
The defense submitted that there is no record of interview in the court file that the defendant was formally arrested and charged for the offences, and asked the court for the allegations before the court is defective.
Prosecution, while responding to the defense submission, says all information is in order and the charges are appropriate and hence asked the court to commit the defendant since evidence is water tight.
When making his ruling, presiding magistrate Paul Puri Nii said there was no fraud or illegality at the time when the registration charges were effected by IPA.
“However, if the witness had misguided or accidently accepted illegal documents to effect the registration but found out later after when the charges had been made then it is in my view that the witness should be the master of his tongue tied and therefore his disappointment should not be hauled to the defendant.
“Thus, there is no prima facie evidence sustaining all the four charges against the defendant, therefore, the charges against the defendant are dismissed,” Nii added.
Outside court Yannum said his employees has been without jobs for almost a year due to the court proceedings, and now that the case is dismissed, it will open the door for business to continue.
“I thanked the judiciary for upholding the rule of law and justice for Papua New Guinea citizens who are very hard working. We are now relieved with the court’s decision,” Yannum said."
Unexploded bomb discovered in attempted arson,03/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3851,"In an incident, Madang police successfully removed an unexploded ordnance (UXO) bomb that was found in front of a Chinese-owned shop at the Lae Builders Company (LBC) area.
Provincial Police Commander Robert Baim said this discovery follows an attempted arson attack that occurred in the early hours of April 1st, 2025.
As to police reports, unknown individuals, believed to be from a nearby settlement, placed the UXO inside three stacked tires and attempted to ignite them, presumably aiming to cause an explosion. Fortunately for the store owner, the bomb did not detonate.
The alarming situation came to light when a vigilant security guard and a resident noticed smoke emanating from the area around 6:00 am. They acted quickly to extinguish the fire and subsequently alerted local authorities, potentially averting a catastrophic event.
Acting Superintendent Robert Baim confirmed the gravity of the situation, stating that had the bomb exploded, it could have caused extensive destruction within a radius of 100-150 meters, threatening nearby businesses, residential areas, and passing pedestrians. The potential for injury or loss of life was significant, underscoring the serious nature of the threat.
“This was a serious threat to public safety,” Baim said.
He praised the swift response of the security personnel and residents, emphasizing that their quick actions prevented what could have been a devastating incident for the community.
Following the initial response, the Madang Criminal Investigation Division (CID) and the Transnational Crime Unit cordoned off the crime scene. They requested assistance from various joint security agencies to manage the situation effectively.
The PNG Defence Force Lae-based Engineering Battalion, along with the Provincial Disaster Office and Provincial Fisheries Division, intervened to safely remove the UXO.
Upon assessment by experts from PNGDF, the UXO was identified as a 105mm high-explosive projectile. This type of ordnance is known for its hazardous fragmentation radius of up to 150 meters, with a dangerous fragmentation range extending as far as 1300 meters.
Given the substantial risks involved, the bomb was carefully transported in sandbags to the Provincial Fisheries Base at Rooke’s Marina, where it was ultimately taken 25 kilometers out to sea for safe disposal.
In the wake of this incident, police have launched a comprehensive investigation and have identified possible suspects connected to the attempted arson. Authorities have indicated that those involved could face serious charges under the newly implemented Counter-Terrorism Act, which aims to address such threats more rigorously.
“Madang is too small to play hide and seek; we will catch up with you soon, so you might as well surrender now. This act is classified as domestic terrorism,” Baim warned potential suspects.
He reiterated that anyone caught engaging in similar activities would be dealt with under the full force of the law, highlighting the seriousness with which authorities are approaching this incident."
Iduhu welcomes decision to recall Parliament,03/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3850,"The Member for Hiri Koiari, Keith Iduhu, has welcomed the recent Court decision to recall Parliament on April 8, 2025.
He stated that this ruling is a testament to the people's voices being heard, emphasizing the importance of responsiveness in governance.
“This is a significant moment for our democracy.
“The people's cries for action and accountability have been acknowledged, and now it is up to the mandated Members of Parliament to come together and make critical decisions that will shape the future of our communities.”
The upcoming parliamentary session is expected to address pressing issues that have been affecting constituents.
Iduhu reiterated the importance of collaboration among MPs to ensure that the needs and concerns of the public are addressed effectively.
With the recall of Parliament on the horizon, there is renewed anticipation regarding the discussions and legislative actions that will follow.
The Supreme Court on Monday, March 31, 2025, ordered the Speaker of the National Parliament to recall the Parliament to meet on April 8, 2025, and to facilitate the debate of the motion of no confidence of November 27, 2024.
The Court heard that the decision of the Private Business Committee to not place the motion of no confidence on the notice paper was contrary to the principle of collective responsibility of the executive arm of government to the Parliament under s 141 of the Constitution; hence ordered for the recall of Parliament."
Angoram needs increased budget allocation,03/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3849,"The Angoram District Development Authority (ADDA) says it requires increased budget allocations to effectively meet the needs of its communities, especially in critical sectors such as education and health.
Angoram MP and chairman of the ADDA, Salio Waipo said this when presenting its 2024 Acquittals to the Department of Rural Development and Implementation from the District Service Improvement Program (DSIP) on Wednesday (March 2nd).
Mr Waipo underscored rural districts' persistent challenges in service delivery due to constrained funding.

"Manning revealed 4,000 arrests made in 2024",03/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3846,"The Commissioner of Police, David Manning, reveals that approximately 4,000 arrests occurred in 2024 for crimes committed throughout the country.
The 4,000 arrests double the number of arrests that occurred in 2022.
Commissioner Manning relieved this during the National Development Forum on Law and Order, hosted by the Consultative Implementation and Monitoring Council (CIMC), on Wednesday in Port Moresby.
He said the increased number of arrests is caused by social disorder, where Papua New Guineans are becoming more violent, involved in using drugs and other illicit activities.
Manning said the statistics call for the community to change their mindset and behaviors.
He said police contribute their part to maintain law and order, but it requires the participation of the community to help police implement law and order in the country.
Manning said the increased number of arrests is one of the many challenges the RPNGC faces.
He put forward some of the recommendations to the forum to better examine and implement.  Some of these recommendations include social changes, increasing youth population, urban drift, effective security forces, forensic science, biometric suspect identification, real-time surveillance of criminals, and geospatial mapping tools.
“I encourage this forum to examine our social challenges, youths, education, housing, population shifts, social changes as well as effective use of our security forces.
“As to our strategic approaches to law enforcement, we have discussed integration of technology and intellectual policing to participate and respond to crimes more effectively.
“Technological advancement such as forensic science, biometric suspect identification, real time surveillance of criminals and geospatial mapping tools are needed to curb crime,” Manning said.
Manning said the police force will continue to enforce its mandated role but requires the support of the community, private sector, developing partners, and the government to work with them in enforcing the rule of law in our community."
Police officers continue studies,03/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3845,"Members of the Royal PNG Constabulary are being allowed to further their education through a study assistance program, under the Papua New Guinea – Australia Policing Partnership.
This year, eight participants from the Lae Metropolitan Command are undertaking various courses in tertiary institutions in Lae and Madang.
A photoshoot was conducted on Tuesday (1st April) at the Lae Metropolitan Command by members of the Australian Federal Police and Royal PNG Constabulary.
AFP’s Detective Sergeant Ben Payton said since its initiation in 2020, the batch this year is by far the largest number that the AFP is supporting in terms of financial assistance.
Six of the eight participants are women officers who are undertaking courses in communication and management.
“What’s trying to be achieved is for RPNGC officers to achieve higher levels of education but primarily, help them with their career path,” said detective sgt Payton. “We look at this group, there’s a lot of future leaders that are amongst the study cadre.
“This is the group for this year and next year, when applications will open at the start of the year, and some people are completing three and four-year degrees so they’ll require ongoing assistance and other people are just starting off on their education journey.”
Lae metropolitan superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, applauded the partnership that is upskilling a good number of women in the Royal PNG Constabulary, as well as future leaders in law enforcement.
“We are fortunate to have them on board because if you look at how we conduct business, things have changed a lot,” said Kunyanban.
“The collection of data, understanding important management best practice application, which is contemporary, if you like. So, we would like to see a lot of training be emphasised on that perspective, and if you look at the batch that is currently undergoing the program, you will see most of them are taking management courses.”
Kunyanban welcomed the skills and knowledge that would be imparted on the participants through the respective diploma and degree courses they are undertaking at the Divine Word University and PNG University of Technology. This, in turn, would be a positive contribution to the Constabulary."
FAO launches National Forest Inventory Learning Journey,02/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3839,"Forests across Asia and the Pacific region cover 740 million hectares, accounting for 18 percent of global forest cover.
These forests are not only critical for the livelihoods of more than 450 million people, but also play a critical economic role, with annual trade in primary forest products surpassing USD 90 billion. Amid the challenges posed by climate change and increasing pressure on natural resources, the need for accurate, national forest data has never been more urgent to inform sustainable policies and actions.
In this context, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has launched the “National Forest Inventory (NFI) Learning Journey” at a regional workshop in Bangkok, Thailand. This innovative, self-paced learning initiative aims to help Member Nations plan, implement, and analyse their national forest inventories. It provides ongoing access to valuable resources to improve forest data management systems and strengthen national capacities.
The launch event brought together forestry officials, technical experts, and institutional partners from 12 Member Nations in Asia and the Pacific region – Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. Regional partners, including the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization (AFoCO), also participated.
“Forests are the lungs of our planet. Accurate, accessible, and transparent forest data tailored to national frameworks, allow countries to monitor ecosystems, track progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which is why National Forest Inventories (NFIs) are so important for collecting and analyzing this data for decision-making”, said Robert Simpson, Deputy Regional Representative, FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific.
“Reliable forest data empowers countries to take informed forest actions on the ground. It is critical that we empower those that have the responsibility to manage this precious resource, with the best available knowledge and technical solutions. By strengthening national capacities in forest monitoring, we are equipping nations with the tools they need to safeguard their forests and build a more resilient future,” noted Julian Fox, FAO Senior Forestry Officer.
This initiative is a collaborative effort, supported by key partners, including the Global Environment Facility (GEF) through the ""Building global capacity to increase transparency in the forest sector (CBIT-Forest)"" project, and the United Kingdom's Accelerating Innovative Monitoring for Forests (AIM4Forests) Initiative. These partnerships reflect FAO’s commitment to enhancing forest monitoring knowledge-sharing globally.
FAO’s Forestry Roadmap: From Vision to Action, 2024–31 underscores forests’ dual role in both protecting and restoring forests and driving productivity. The roadmap outlines strategic actions to guide sustainable forest management over the next decade, with a focus on science and innovation to scale up solutions.
FAO states that its efforts to enhance national forest monitoring systems (NFMSs) are critical for improving forest data transparency and advancing climate action in Asia and the Pacific region. As Member Nations continue to make strides in forest management, strengthening NFIs at the regional level is essential for providing consistent and accurate data. This, in turn, will help Member Nations meet their commitments to sustainable forest management, ecosystem health, and climate mitigation.
FAO encourages all relevant stakeholders—governments, forestry experts, researchers, and institutions—to explore the NFI Learning Journey and strengthen their national capacities in forest monitoring."
Successful raid by Lae police,02/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3838,"A successful raid by Lae police has seen them apprehend suspects and haul in an arsenal of weapons following an armed robbery at Tanam, along the Okuk Highway, on Tuesday, February 25th, 2025.
Lae’s National Crime Investigation Unit and Sector Response Unit worked together for a month to gather intelligence and bring the case to a close.
There was a sense of accomplishment and relief as the 17-man composite team, consisting of the National Crime Investigation Unit and Sector Response Unit, gathered this morning at the Somu Sigob Haus, along with the arsenal of weapons that were collected during their raids.
When applauding the team for their perseverance and dedication, Lae Metropolitan Superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, said this is the result of a month’s investigation into the identities and whereabouts of the eight armed suspects.
It was reported that the suspects had broken into the Homestate property at Tanam between 2am and 6am on Tuesday, February 25th.
Police reported that during the time of robbery, the suspects wore masks and were armed with a factory-made shotgun and several staple guns.
The eight suspects allegedly stole K800 in cash, a black company pistol and hijacked the company’s 5-door Landcruiser.
“These young police officers here have done a tremendous job,” said Kunyanban. “It’s not easy to obtain information to go after criminals, especially when the crime was committed and they had already escaped.
“It’s a bit complicated than doing a fraud case or straightforward case. Like, in a fraud case, you already have the perpetrator of a crime – of how they got money. But when you come to criminal matters, it’s quite hard. When they commit a crime and they go, you’ll depend very much on artificial intelligence – which was the key breakthrough – and then you have human intelligence.
“As a result, suspects were apprehended, they retrieved the firearm, the shotgun, the homemade guns and they also found a hand grenade. If they hadn’t retrieved this hand grenade, it would definitely be used in another crime.”
Aside from the weapons, 17 live ammunitions were seized, including an arrow gun with 26 arrows, a slingshot and three two-way radios.
Kunyanban said the suspects will be charged with break-and-enter and stealing, possession of unlicenced firearm, the unauthorised possession of an explosive and the unlawful use of a motor vehicle."
Law & Order forum underway,02/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3837,"The Consultative Implementation and Monitoring Council began its three-day National Development Forum on law and order in Port Moresby today.

The forum is themed ‘Strengthening the Rule of Law: A Roadmap for Future Generation’.
Over 150 people from key government agencies and stakeholders from the public and private sectors, are expected to participate in this three-day meet. Prime Minister James Marape and CIMC Chairman Ano Pala officially opened the forum this morning.
In his keynote address, the prime minister encouraged participants to raise issues and give recommendations to the government to implement in order to improve livelihoods and the wellbeing of people, and create safer communities for our children, and their children.
Mr Marape put on the floor some challenges that can be discussed during the forum including investment in education, strengthening the judicial process, increasing anti-corruption measures, improve the role of the police force, and increase community contribution in the law and justice sector, including modernizing and updating the laws of Papua New Guinea.
CIMC Chairman Ano Pala urged participants to conduct a thorough assessment of the pressing law and order situation in the country. He said this assessment should involve analyzing the legal framework, reviewing existing laws, and the constitutional framework to identify consistency gaps that may undermine the rule of law.
“We must evaluate institutions, examining the independence and effectiveness of judicial bodies, law enforcement agencies and other legal institutions, gather public input, engaging citizens, civil society organisations and legal expects in discussions to gather insights on their experience through the legal system and make recommendations on how best we can deal with issues of law and order in our contry,” Pala said.
The forum is funded by the Government of Papua New Guinea through the Departments of Treasury and National Planning and Monitoring, ExxonMobil, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) through the European Union (EU) funded Governance Program - PNG Anti-Corruption Project & the Transparency and Accountability in PNG Project.
The forum ends this Friday, April 4th."
Unitech changes graduation venue,02/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3836,"The Papua New Guinea University of Technology will be hosting its 57th graduation ceremony at the Sir Ignatius Kilage indoor stadium in Lae, Morobe Province, on April 11th.
This is unlike previous years where the graduation is held at the main Taraka campus.
Registrar, Veronica Thomas, says the decision stands despite opposing views from a few graduands and students.
The decision was made following “negative experiences encountered over the past years”.
“Last year, graduands left the arena due to the heat, leaving a bad impression on our guests,” said Thomas.
“This has shown that the temporary arena on campus is no longer conducive and inappropriate to host the students, guests, and parents, due to tight spacing, poor ventilation and crowd control.
“The Council has taken the graduands’ actions and comments made by the students (in a students’ forum last year) seriously, and has, in its wisdom, resolved that the ceremony be held off campus, until a suitable facility is built on campus to host our graduation ceremonies.
“The move off campus will enhance the overall experience for our graduates and their guests. The graduands will be given two passes for their guests who will be seated comfortably within the arena to observe the ceremony, compared to the seating arrangements on campus.”
The registrar outlined that the university is collaborating with police to address security concerns, adding they believe the change in venue will greatly enrich the graduation experience for all involved."
NRI on ways to address lawlessness,01/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3831,"The rise in lawlessness in Papua New Guinea (PNG) threatens businesses, government properties, and the safety of the general public.
Besides straining the country's police force, the lawlessness also poses a critical risk to national security, economic growth, and the country's development.
The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) Development Plan acknowledges the shortage of police manpower and recognises the need to recruit more police officers. Meanwhile, the country's increasing population complicates the RPNGC's core role in providing effective policing nationwide.
In a recent paper, the Papua New Guinea National Research Institute (PNGNRI) in Spotlight Vol. 18, Issue 3, titled ""Strategies to Address Lawlessness and Strengthen Law and Order in Papua New Guinea"" by Joe Harry, examines PNG’s shortage of police personnel as a key factor hindering effective law enforcement and discusses actionable strategies for enhancing recruitment, training, and deployment efforts country.
To address this concern, the paper suggests the following actions should be taken to strengthen RPNGC's enforcement capabilities:
•	Invest in modern policing technology;
•	Establish public-private partnerships for law enforcement;
•	Initiate an effective crime stoppers program;
•	Set up additional police training colleges in each region;
•	Implement decentralized police recruitment;
•	Enhance the police support infrastructure;
•	Strengthen community-police relations;
•	Provide incentives and support for police officers.
Implementing these strategies requires a strong political will to address police manpower shortages in PNG.
The paper emphasizes that this is particularly essential for restoring law and order in both urban and rural areas, focusing more on rural places, where most of the country's population resides and where crime has recently escalated."
Kiunga’s double celebrations,01/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3829,"A double celebration for Kiunga town in the North Fly district as the people witnessed the opening of a new terminal building for Kiunga Airport and the ground-breaking ceremony of the Kiunga airport upgrading project.
The Prime Minister and the delegation were welcomed with a guard of honour by the Members of the PNG Defense Force and North Fly Police Command before the formalities where the Prime Minister cut the ribbon to signify the opening of the new terminal.
The 7.8-million-kina new terminal building that was initiated by the North Fly District Development Authority and Sustainable Development Program is one that will go down in history.
“Our investment from SDP has been 3.3 million to ensure that we provide safe, efficient and a modern gateway for this important township for the people of North Fly District Western Province and also PND. Air travel remains a critical link for our remote communities inland in Western Province. SDO, in partnership with agencies like the rural airstrip agency, we maintain 45 air strips across western province, and this year, we will be open 30 rural airstrips across North Fly,” said CEO for SDP, Lesieli Taviri.
After many years of using a storage container, the Kiunga terminal has now been developed into a new and proper terminal. Member for North Fly, James Donald spoke of the work done to complete the terminal.
“The project cost 7.8 million-kina, DDA put in 4.5 million-kina, SDP put in 3.3 million-kina and the DSIP money for North Fly is 2.1 million-kina and goloha, PIP 1.5 million-kina and Na 1.1 million-kina Dividend from Ok Tedi Mining.
We were proactive to put our own resources quickly and to have this facility (new terminal) ready quickly, because it was an eye-sore and an embarrassment. Within the last two and a half years,  we've done that, and that's why today we open the new terminal today.”
The celebrations then moved over to the ground-breaking ceremony of the Kiunga airport upgrading project. This project will be funded by the National Airport Corporation together, the National Government, the Asian Development Bank and key partners.
“I want to commend the District, Province and the Honourable member for North Fly, James Donald and the partnership to do the work.

Hela aims to revive 15 rural airstrips,01/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3827,"The Hela Provincial Government in collaboration with the Rural Airstrips Agency (RAA) of PNG Limited, will revive 15 rural airstrips in the province.
Marking the collaboration through the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on Wednesday 26 March, the Provincial Government, represented by Provincial Member Philip Undialu and RAA Chief Executive Officer Kim Rose Opiti, signed the agreement signaling the first phase to reviving the rural airstrips.
“Rural airstrips are basically the lifeline of the people living in our rural communities and it’s important we get to serve those that are in the rural communities because they represent at least more than 70 percent of our population of the country so it’s important we must be able to deliver services to those in the rural communities,” said Opiti.
Undialu said for many years, the focus of the provincial government and District Development Authorities (DDAs) have been on road conditions under the connect PNG program, however, the focus is shifting to cater for air transport needs.
“Over the years, we’ve been focusing on road; some areas we have reached, more areas need to be reached.
“We will commit to revive about fifteen airstrips; only few are operating and most have been neglected for a long time. Part of the reason is a lack of coordination between the responsible agencies, including the provincial government, DDAs, and others. Now, we are gathering ourselves to put our acts together. Collaborative effort in putting our resources together to get those airstrips revived,” said Undialu.
“Hela provincial government will commit money. We have a good working relationship with our DDAs, our rural members. We have done a few works together on the road. Now we are coming into the airstrip together.”
Twelve of the 15 airstrips are located in the Koroba-Lake Kopiago electorate, whose local Member of Parliament, William Bando, was also present for the signing of the MOA.
MP Bando commended the initiative of this program and is keen on seeing the work commence.
Furthermore, Undialu made a special mention, thanking the Mission Aviation Fellowship and church organizations in the province for filling the gaps not covered by the provincial government.
He said, “They’ve done a fantastic job over the years. And church organizations that are serving rural areas under difficult circumstances, they’re able to deliver where government cannot deliver. Our efforts will complement their efforts. We just want to commit that Hela Provincial Government and our DDAs are coming on board to support the RAA to help us revive the airstrips so that they serve our people better.”
In the meantime, the RAA clarified that the total cost of the investment will be revealed after it conducts surveys and develops a proper scope of work for each of the 15 airstrips."
Toare Cultural Centre Open,01/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3826,"The Toare Cultural Centre was officially launched last month through a collaboration between the National Cultural Commission (NCC) and UNESCO in preserving Papua New Guinea’s cultural heritage.
The event, held in Toare village, Gulf Province, was attended by NCC’s Research Manager Alex Pukie, Gulf Provincial Government’s Tourism and Culture Coordinator Oscar Evara, Toare Mask Festival Chairman Ben Micha, and village elders. The centre aims to protect the unique Toare mask tradition by providing a dedicated space for their storage and cultural practices.

Mr Pukie highlighted the significance of this initiative, stating that it is the first of its kind in PNG and the Pacific. Meanwhile, Oscar Evara emphasized the cultural and economic potential of heritage preservation.
The people of Toare have pledged to maintain the centre, ensuring that their traditions continue to thrive in a rapidly changing world."
Fuel Supply Challenges Eased,01/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3825,"Customers will now enjoy easy access to fuel supply from Mobil Oil New Guinea through its bottom-loading capabilities, which are now based in its Lae Terminal.
Mobil Oil New Guinea, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil Corporation, recently commissioned a K40 million project as part of its ongoing support to enhance and strengthen its fuel supply stability and marketability program in the country.
This initiative, which is now fully operational, once again highlights Mobil Oil New Guinea’s commitment to reliably providing quality fuel to support the growing demand of its customers in Lae, Madang and the Highlands provinces.
It follows a recent major tank investment to expand the fuel supply at its Idubada Terminal in Port Moresby in 2024 (pictured below).
The Lae Terminal upgrade included the installation of a bottom-loading facility to complement the existing top-loading rack. Together, this combination speeds the loading process and shortens delivery times from the Lae Terminal to its customers.
“This upgrade significantly reduces truck loading times, allowing more trucks to be loaded each day at the facility. Our customers reap the benefit of the enhanced availability of our high-quality fuel,” said Dinesh Sivasamboo, Chairman and Managing Director of ExxonMobil PNG Limited.
“Throughout its long history in PNG, Mobil has always been committed to implementing initiatives that will better serve our customers,” he continued.
“At our core, we are a PNG company with ExxonMobil’s unmatched global expertise and capabilities, and we continue to look for ways to strengthen and grow our business – and fuel stability – for Papua New Guinea.”
For more than a century, Mobil Oil New Guinea – through its network of terminals, branded retail service stations, and wholesale customers - has been committed to the country and its people and stands ready to continue to be the country’s most trusted and reliable supplier in the decades to come."

The tournament stage is set for Monday, 7 April at Santos National Football Stadium and National Sports Institute in Goroka, which will bring together the best schools' players from throughout the country to compete in a tournament that highlights the depth of talent.

NRL Bid chief executive officer, Andrew Hill, sees the tournament as an important addition to the current pathways structure.
“Everything that we are putting in place right now is to create a junior pathway system which enables our players the best opportunity to play at the highest level possible.
“To do that, we need a strong Academy program and intense, competitive football at all age groups leading into a senior NRL squad.
“We have already seen the great talent that we have across the country, and we are now creating the environment for those players to experience the best coaching and playing opportunities, as well as learn the right habits in terms of preparation and recovery,” said Hill.
“I know that Academy Head Coach Joe Grima and the rest of our coaching staff can’t wait to see our players in action.”"

Jimjam health centre embraces EDEN,01/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3822,"Twenty-one community members of Jimjam Community Health Centre in Yawar Village of Rai Coast district were the first to graduate from a week-long training in rolling out the Effective Development Empowering the Nation (EDEN) program. The training is run by the Lutheran Health Services (LHS) for the Madang/Sepik region.
EDEN allows for communities to take ownership of their hygiene and health practices, avoiding preventable diseases and illnesses. It helps communities to be more aware of their surroundings and share ideas on how they can be able to manage their health with whatever resources their health facility is able to provide.
Trainings in the Madang/Sepik region began last year with Community Health Workers in Madang, and the East and West Sepik provinces. EDEN trainings are captured in four main pillars; Wholistic, Community Ownership, Development and Multiplication.
Sr. Rhondy Maso, Health Secretary for the Madang/Sepik region stated that their key priority is to work with communities, the government and LHS to ensure this program is a success. In addition, Sr. Maso said there must be government recognition, including the Madang Provincial Health Authority in support services.
Jimjam Health Centre in Rai Coast is the first to roll out EDEN. It can now source external donor funding to assist with implementation before an evaluation is carried out. The evaluation will involve an assessment of successes and challenges in order to prepare for 2026.
Fadok Matei, the Community Health Worker in charge of Jimjam health centre, commended the local community for building the health centre. The clinic was a community initiative. Matei said it was first built with thatched roofing and over the years, fundraising efforts gave the facility a permanent modern look with roofing irons. He said the Yawar people are a great example of resilience and self-sufficiency to other communities in Rai Coast.
Formerly known as the Healthy Island Concept, EDEN was not realized due to lack of commitment from relevant stakeholders. In 2014 EDEN was introduced to LHS, who have taken ownership, driving this concept under its Health Promotion Section in public health.
Sr. Maso said other health centres in the district will be undergoing the EDEN training in the coming weeks."

The consultation, led by CLRC Secretary Dr. Mange Matui and Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) Deputy Commissioner of Administration Dr. Philip Mitna, alongside a team of senior officers, conducted views and recommendations addressing various aspects of policing.
Discussions explored substantive laws governing the RPNGC code of conduct, such as the Police Act, the Claims by and Against the State, the Wrongs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, and other relevant laws.
Dr. Matui emphasized that the closed consultation with the police ensures their perspectives are considered in thoroughly addressing this issue.
TOR 24 was issued to the CLRC by the Minister for Justice and Attorney General Pila Niningi and officially launched on 25th October 2024. The directive, which emanated from a discussion paper compiled by CLRC, tasked the Commission to review laws surrounding the vicarious liability of the State about police brutality cases in PNG.
This review aims to address the rising instances of police brutality and the substantial financial compensation the State is paying to victims. The review will also assess the effectiveness of laws governing the application of vicarious liability principles in addressing police brutality cases.
TOR 24 outlines seven thematic areas that guide the consultation on the review of laws related to police brutality in PNG. These areas have also been discussed in provincial consultations across the country. The key themes are:
•	Exemplary Damages (Legal issue)
•	Standard rates for damages (compensation) arising from police brutality (Legal issue)
•	Legal and policy framework on police use of force and firearms (Legal issue)
•	Penalties for offenses arising from police brutality cases (Legal issue)
•	Training of police officers (Administrative issue)
•	Counselling of police officers (Administrative issue)
•	Government initiatives and plans to address police brutality (Administrative issue)
•	Additional issues for discussion
So far, the CLRC has conducted closed consultations in six provinces: Eastern Highlands, East Sepik, Morobe, New Ireland, West New Britain, and Milne Bay. Consultations within NCD were concluded last week, and the final stakeholders’ consultations for TOR 24 will be completed in the Western Highlands Province by the end of next week.
The views gathered from the TOR 24 consultations will contribute to a report containing policy, legislative, and administrative reform proposals. This report will be presented to the Minister for Justice in June this year."

Kelua-2 Launches 10-Year Disaster Development Plan,29/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3794,"The people of Kelua-2 Ward 3 have taken a bold step toward securing their future by launching their first-ever Community-Based Disaster Risk Management Plan. This plan will guide disaster preparedness and development efforts for the next ten years (2025–2035), ensuring a safer and more resilient community.
The launch event, held at Mt. Ambra, was attended by provincial government officials, community leaders, and development partners. Among the dignitaries were representatives from the Governor’s Office, the Provincial Administrator’s Office, the Hagen Central District Administration, and the UN Migration Agency (IOM). Their presence underscored the significance of this initiative for both the community and the province.
The plan was developed through a partnership between IOM and the Western Highlands Provincial Disaster Office. Through this collaboration, the community actively participated in identifying risks, setting priorities, and developing strategies to manage disasters more effectively. Farmers, women, youth, business owners, and other vulnerable groups all had a say in shaping the plan to ensure it meets the needs of everyone.
Kelua-2 Ward 3 is among the most disaster-prone areas in the province, facing frequent droughts, bushfires, strong winds, and road damage. The 2015 El Niño-induced drought had a severe impact, drying up water sources and increasing waterborne diseases, particularly among children and the elderly. In addition to these hazards, the ward has seen an increasing number of internally displaced people moving in from other parts of the Highlands, putting pressure on land, water, and essential services.
“This is a historic moment for our community,” said Kelua-2 Ward Councilor, David Kela.
“For years, we have struggled with disasters and limited resources. Now, with this plan, we have a clear path forward. Our top priority is ensuring access to clean water for the 5,000 residents and livestock that depend on it.”
The CBDRM Plan not only addresses disaster risks but also integrates long-term development priorities. It includes measures for:
•	Early warning systems and emergency response strategies
•	Infrastructure improvements, including access to clean water
•	Environmental conservation to reduce disaster risks
•	Economic opportunities for community members
•	Social cohesion programs to strengthen unity
The plan was officially endorsed by the Provincial Administrator, District CEO, Deputy District CEO, Provincial Disaster Coordinator, LLG President, Ward Councillor, and a community representative. Their signatures serve as a commitment to supporting the community in implementing the outlined projects.
During the launch, Steven Moka, Executive Officer to the Provincial Administrator, congratulated the community on becoming the first ward in Hagen Central District to develop such a plan. He acknowledged that while all council wards are required to have development plans, many struggle due to funding limitations.
“Kelua-2 is leading the way, and IOM’s support in this initiative is invaluable,” he said.
The Western Highlands Provincial Government, through the Office of the Governor Wai Rapa, reaffirmed its commitment to making the plan operational. Similarly, the Hagen Central District Administration pledged to work with relevant stakeholders to implement the projects outlined in the plan.
IOM’s Chief of Mission, David Arnold, highlighted the importance of community-driven disaster risk management.
“Strengthening disaster preparedness at the community level is essential to building resilience and ensuring sustainable development. This plan empowers the people of Kelua-2 to take ownership of their future by integrating disaster risk reduction into their long-term development priorities.”
Local businessman and community leader, Maip, expressed his deep appreciation for the initiative:
“I am old now, and I have never seen anything like this in our community. This is the first of its kind. I encourage the youth to embrace this opportunity and support the activities in this plan.”

Strengthening Community Resilience in PNG’s Highlands,29/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3791,"Communities in Papua New Guinea’s Highlands face ongoing challenges from natural hazards, displacement, and conflict. To enhance local resilience, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is actively supporting community-led initiatives focused on disaster preparedness, humanitarian response, and long-term stability.

IOM continues to work alongside local governments and partners to address these challenges, ensuring that displaced families receive adequate support and that communities are better equipped to face future crises.
In Jiwaka Province, IOM has supported the establishment of a new evacuation center in Parmel, providing a critical safety net for families during disasters such as floods and landslides. This center serves not only as an emergency shelter but also as a hub for training programs, awareness campaigns, and community-building activities. It also plays an essential role in offering protection to survivors of gender-based violence and other vulnerable individuals, ensuring they receive the assistance they need.
Joe Kundul, President of the Parmel Community Development Association, emphasized the importance of the center, stating: ""This center is vital to our community’s efforts in disaster preparedness, response, and peacebuilding. It has served as an evacuation site during natural disasters, providing displaced families with shelter, safety, and essential support. In times of conflict, it has functioned as a safe house, offering protection to the most vulnerable, including women, children, and the elderly. Beyond emergencies, the center plays a key role in strengthening community resilience through training sessions, awareness programs, and peace dialogues.
“These initiatives have helped equip community members with the knowledge and skills needed to prevent and mitigate conflicts, promote peaceful coexistence, and improve disaster readiness. By fostering open discussions and collaboration, we are building a safer, more united, and resilient community.""
Local leaders have highlighted the importance of partnerships in responding to displacement and emergencies. Western Highlands Provincial Administrator, Joseph Mangbil, acknowledged the province’s growing role as a refuge for displaced families seeking safety and opportunities, stressing the need for increased resources to support affected communities.
In Enga Province, Acting Provincial Administrator Kenneth Andrew commended IOM’s contribution to the response efforts following the Mulitaka landslide, underscoring the need for ongoing technical support to enhance disaster management and recovery strategies.
IOM states that it remains committed to collaborating with the government and communities to build a more resilient future.

The people of Garaina, in Morobe Province, and Goilala, in Central Province, are isolated from the rest of the country due to no road accessibility.
On Tuesday, March 25th, Member for Wau-Waria, Marsh Narewec led a delegation to Bapi village, in the Garaina Valley, to do groundbreaking for pilot tracks to continue for the Morobe Northern Highway.
From Bapi they got on a chopper and continued to the Sumu Airstrip for the ground breaking of the Waria-Goilala Highway.
“There are three missing links being constructed on the particular corridor; from Morobe coming in to Southern corridor,” outlined Works Secretary, Gibson Holemba, after their trip to Wau-Waria.
“We have one coming from Bulolo to Menyamya, down to Epo in Gulf. That other one that we just recently opened is from Waria coming in to Goilala then we have the other missing link, which is from Waria to Bapi; we just launched. And then, the other one is from Bapi all the way down to Simkira; a village in Sohe district (Northern Province).
“These are the three main missing links connecting Momase into Southern region.
“The scope of the work is basically, doing pilot tracks ahead then we have the next team who are doing re-graveling and widening the road. Also, building some culverts and drainage at the same time.
“We are targeting to connect Menyamya to Gulf by June of this year, before 16th September. We are also targeting to reach Garaina Station before 16th of September. And we are also targeting to reach the first village of Goilala before 16th of September.”

This year, the district has budgeted K2 million and has applied for another K10 million from Connect PNG.
Wau-Waria MP, Marsh Narewec, says funding is yet to be approved. That was why he had invited the Works Minister, Solan Mirisim, to accompany him to Bapi to see for himself the people’s need for accessibility, and push for funding approval.

Vehicle owners and police told to work together to clear traffic yard,27/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3760,"Accidents are happening every day in the city of Port Moresby, and the storage location at the traffic office in Boroko is filled with accident vehicles, some of which have been cleared by the police and the courts.
The Commander of the National Capital District and Central Provinces, Benjamin Turi, is now calling on the owners of the accident vehicles to visit the traffic officers and clear up space for other accident vehicles that need to be there for investigation purposes.
Commander Turi said the car park at the traffic office must be reserved for accident vehicles only while they are being investigated.
He said the officer in charge of the traffic office is in communication with him to find ways to relocate all the unclaimed vehicles to a location where they can be stored away.
“Vehicle hire companies or individuals that have their vehicles at the traffic office must visit the case officers and discuss how they will remove their vehicles home if the investigation has been completed. It doesn’t look good when the ragged vehicles are lying there. If the vehicles are there and the investigators are not doing their job, please write to us so my office can check on the investigators and find out why they are not attending to you. With that, I want you all to communicate with each other, especially the victims, the drivers, and the police investigators. Frequent communication will help speed up the investigation and also ensure justice is served to all parties involved,” Commander Turi said.
Turi further added that since the old police vehicles are now taken to Bomana Driving School to be stored there, the unclaimed vehicles should also be taken there."
"Respect privacy of citizens, says Tomuriesa",27/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3757,"Papua New Guineans have the right to hold the government accountable if and when decisions are made, especially amendments of laws that are not in favor of the people, says the Opposition Leader Douglas Tomuriesa.
Tomuriesa said the restriction to access Facebook early this week using the Counter-Terrorism Act 2024 is a testament of the government’s decision made without the favor of its people.
“What you have seen with the banning of Facebook is the beginning of communist practice in our country. These laws are becoming sickening; it's beginning to encroach into the privacy of ordinary Papua New Guineans.
“We’ve enjoyed democracy in our country for almost 50 years, and the democracy of this nation must be respected, and the rule of law must be respected.
“Papua New Guineans do not need the terrorism bill, the people need laws that benefit them.
“It's about time Papua New Guineans look at this law and tell your leaders this is wrong. Challenge your leaders.
Challenge your leaders in the provinces, challenge your leaders in the district, tell them that the changes you are making are not in the good interest of PNG.

Madang mayor assists self-help project,26/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3752,"The Ward 08 youths of Madang Urban Local Level Government have taken it on themselves to fix the dilapidated jetty at the DCA Boat Stop after witnessing the rundown state it was in and how boats were dropping of mothers and children at unsafe locations.
Madang is a province surrounded by islands, scattered off the mainland, especially within the Madang Urban LLG. In other areas of the mainland, there are access points along the coastline which boats use to pick up and drop off passengers instead of travelling on PMVs by road.
Many of these access points have long deteriorated due to agents of weathering, exacerbated by the effects of climate change. One of these access points is the DCA boat stop which accommodates more than a 1000 people daily from ward 08 all the way to ward 10. This area hosts the former timber company of Jant, Lutheran Shipping, Divine Word University residential areas, the settlements nearby and the working class renting within the area.
To their relief, Madang Town Mayor Peter Yalsy committed to assisting them and on Tuesday (25 March 2025), he purchased and delivered six cement bags to carry out foundational works on the already constructed frame and promised to deliver meshed wires later.
Mr. Yalsy praised the youths for the initiative.
Jacob Manu, a community leader of Ward 08 stated that at times when the weather is bad, they look for ideal spots to offload passengers. He added that mothers and the elderly sometimes have a hard time getting off the boats onto tree stumps or root areas. This has prompted the youths to seek ways in which they could rebuild the jetty from what was left.
He thanked the mayor for recognizing their efforts and expressed how this will impact the lives of ordinary Papua New Guineans.
Meantime, the same amount of bags and meshed wires will be given to the Jant boat stop as well."

Morobe Provincial Police Commander, Jacob Singura, directed men to “monitor and contain any gatherings in large numbers”.
“We are to ensure public safety and the protection of lives and properties. There will be no protests in our command and province as a whole.”
While the organiser of the purported March 26th ‘call for action’ remains anonymous, the widely circulated message outlined two main factors behind the protest:
1.	Limiting the Vote of No Confidence; and
2.	The recent Facebook shutdown in PNG
However, police have emphasised that authorisation was not sought for the proposed public gathering, while the nation needs to remember what had transpired in the last protest that was held in January 10, 2024.
Lae residents were reminded of how Lae police had swifty and effectively responded to the January 11th, 2024, attempted riot; a spillover from the Port Moresby violence and looting on January 10th, 2024.

Cynthia's journey in keeping the family art alive,25/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3739,"As women across Papua New Guinea come together on 24th of March, 2025 to celebrate the National Women’s day in Port Moresby, a beautiful story of passion, family and craftmanship emerges.
At 39, Cynthia Mai’s journey is one of resilience, passion, and a deep connection to her roots.
She was born and raised in Wewak, East Sepik, where her story begins in a small coastal tow. Cynthia is one of eight siblings, four sisters and four brothers, all raised by parents who were both from Angoram, East Sepik.
Growing up, the values of family, culture, and creativity were instilled in her, thanks to parents who were deeply involved in designing arts, crafts, and the sale of ancient artifacts.
From an early age, Cynthia Mai was surrounded by the beauty of handmade artifacts, and it was here, within her family, that her inspiration and motivation first took root. She would watch her family members work with skill and pride, crafting objects that carried the rich heritage of their culture. This early exposure to the world of arts and crafts would lay the foundation for what would later become her passion and livelihood.
After completing her primary and high school education in Wewak, she ventured to Port Moresby, where she pursued her tertiary studies at Port Moresby Business College. In 2010, she earned her Diploma in Financial Accounting, a qualification that led her to work in formal employment at PNG Air Freights and later, East West Transport. For six years, Cynthia Mai worked diligently in these roles, including a position as a Customs Office Manager.
Despite the stability and opportunities in her formal career, she couldn’t shake the pull towards something more meaningful, something that resonated with her heart.
In 2015, after years in the corporate world, Cynthia Mai made a brave decision to step away from formal employment. It was a leap of faith, but one that was fueled by a deep desire to connect with her culture and family in a more authentic way.
The following year, she secured a space at the Tabari Crafts Market in Boroko, Port Moresby, and began weaving and selling her own handmade artifacts alongside her sisters. This was the beginning of her journey into the world of craftsmanship.
The transition from corporate work to becoming an entrepreneur in the world of design and crafts wasn’t easy, but it was undeniably fulfilling.
Cynthia Mai, with her sisters by her side, began creating beautiful, intricate pieces that reflected their heritage. Pieces that told stories of their ancestors and their lands. Moreover, they didn’t just create and sell their own artifacts; they also bought artifacts from Wewak and resold them in Port Moresby, helping preserve and share the art and culture of East Sepik with a wider audience."
Media Council calls for transparency,25/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3738,"“For the government to proceed to conduct tests of new technology on its citizens without their knowledge borders on political autocracy, and an abuse of human rights,” says the President of the Media Council of PNG, Neville Choi.
MCPNG is calling for more transparency amongst government agencies in consideration of matters directly impacting free speech and freedom of expression.
It also voiced its concern that government agencies can ‘test’ new technology on Papua New Guinean citizens in community spaces like social media, without any warning, and without consideration for the democratic principles of full disclosure and transparent governance.
This is about what the police minister has described as the testing of new technology to enhance law enforcement against the abuse of social media platforms.
Inquiries by MCPNG Member Newsrooms to the Department of Information and Communication Technology (DICT) and the National Information and Communication Authority (NICTA), and a media statement released around midnight last night by the latter clearly indicate that both these agencies who should be leading any public agenda on social media were completely unaware of what the police minister was referring to.
MCPNG Media Members were also very critical of the lack of urgency by government agencies to provide credible information to the mainstream media to counter growing misinformation amongst the public.
Choi described the Police Minister’s statement as “vague”.
“The police minister in his vague statement voiced a sense of accomplishment at what he refers to as the successful testing of technology capable of combatting the abuse of social media platforms in the country.
Speaking on behalf of MCPNG, Mr. Choi said for the RPNGC to test new technology without the knowledge of both NICTA and DICT is now pushing the boundaries of jurisdiction into the private spaces of citizens, and giving too much power to one person to decide what matters constitute threats to national security and justify such action."
Constable Greg Wii apologises,25/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3737,"Constable Greg Wii has come out to publicly apologize for his inappropriate behavior to Dr. Jimmy Aipit and his family, the Royal Constabulary and the country as a whole at the Madang Town Police station in January.
Constable Wii and his four accomplices are facing seven charges for allegedly threatening, assaulting and discharging a firearm on the 17th of January, 2025.
Wii provided a formal apology to Dr Aipit and his family, the community of Regina Avenue and the Engan Community for inciting fear in the community.
“On the 16th of January 2025, I made a grave error in judgement. I pointed my firearm at a civilian, a situation that caught the attention of the nation. This was not only inappropriate; it was a violation of the trust you place in us as law enforcement officers. I am deeply sorry for the fear and distress that I caused. No one should feel threatened in their own community, especially by someone who is meant to ensure their safety. My actions were not reflective of the values we aim to upload as police officers,” Mr. Wii stated.
“To Dr. Jimmy Aipit and family, I am deeply sorry for my inappropriate actions and word. I regret the fear instilled and I hope to make amends. Your safety and dignity are paramount and I failed to uphold that in our interaction. I also want to extend my sincerest apologies to the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, Police Commissioner, Provincial Police Commander Madang, all the hard-working men and women in blue all across the county, my family and friends, civilians and colleagues that know me personally as a person and most of all, the general public of this great nation,” Mr. Wii further stated.
Officer in Charge of the Madang town police station, Steven Etna explained to those gathered during the peace ceremony that the event was conducted to fulfil the court orders of the summary offences. The committal proceeding will take place on the 27th March. Mr. Etna also highlighted the fact that the court cases are separate from his administrative decisions which will also come into play after court cases are done.
In addition, ACPfor Northern Command, Peter Guiness stated that times are changing and so police men and women need to show the public that they are trustworthy and can be counted on for protection. ACP Guiness also urged young recruits to work towards building confidence and trust within communities so that they can better assist police better."
Waigani Police pilot community policing initiative,25/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3734,"The Waigani Police Station has piloted a community policing initiative recently to create safer neighborhoods and strengthen relationships between law enforcement and residents in the community.
Through this initiative, the Waigani Police has encouraged citizens to actively participate in decision-making, problem-solving, and public safety activities. Community members will be involved in shaping the policing efforts in their areas, ensuring that law enforcement strategies reflect each neighborhood's unique needs and concerns.
This initiative is supported by the EU-PNG Partnership for Good Governance (P4GG), which is working alongside the RPNGC to strengthen community policing as part of broader efforts to enhance security, rule of law, and access to justice in Papua New Guinea. Through P4GG, supoort is being provided to equip police with the necessary skills and resources to foster trust and engagement with the communities they serve.
NCD/Central Divisional Commander Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi said, “Through this pilot project, we aim to focus on open communication, transparency, and proactive problem-solving. Our officers will be visible, accessible, and approachable, creating opportunities for meaningful interactions with residents. There are existing programs like the community watch programs in place which the police officers need to make themselves available to those in charge of those programs so they can work together. “
Key to this community policing initiative is the presence of dedicated community police officers who will build lasting relationships by being visible, engaging with residents regularly, and attending local meetings. These officers will not only patrol their designated areas but will also focus on open communication with the people they serve. By establishing trust and fostering cooperation, the community policing model aims to improve public safety and reduce fear of crime.
The Family and Sexual Violence Unit (FSVU) is an integral part of this initiative. Community members and police are encouraged to work together to spot early signs of crimes of this nature against children and women before they escalate.
RPNG’s Director FSV, Superintendent Delilah Sandeka said, “We all play a role in making our communities safer and ensuring that victims of family and sexual violence receive the justice and support they deserve.”
By promoting shared responsibility for public safety, the Waigani Police Station hopes to create a safer, more connected community where everyone feels valued, heard, and protected."
Paita back as Mining Minister,25/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3731,"Member for Finschafen and Former Minister for Planning, Rainbo Paita is back in cabinet as the Mining Minister.
Paita replaces Wake Goi, who’s been moved to the Civil Aviation Ministry following Walter Schanaubelt’s resignation as minister, to return to the province to participate in the leadership vacuum left behind by the late Sir Julius Chan.
Prime Minister James Marape made these announcements early this morning en route to New Zealand for bilateral talks.
“I spoke to the Honourable Wake Goi last night, and I have moved him to the civil aviation sector to be focused more on rural airstrips to ensure that our rural PNG is connected by airstrips also, as well as linking up with key priority airports that need to be attended to - Wewak Airport and Terminal, Tokua Airport and Terminal, Buka Airport and Terminal, are three priorities for us, completing Madang Terminal, completing Wapenamanda Terminal, as well as focus on Kerema and Daru Airport. These were instructions passed to him last night for him to work in this space,” the Prime Minister said.
The transport portfolio, which was also held by Schnaubelt is now being assigned to Finance Minister Miki Kaeok as Goi takes on just the Civil Aviation portfolio.
The Prime Minister said as Paita takes up this new role as Mining Ministers., he will work to deliver outstanding agreements for mining projects around the country.
“He was specially tasked to deliver Porgera CDA completion, deliver Mine Development Contract for Wafi Golpu.
“Also, certain instructions were given to him to make sure the joint study, the joint feasibility study by Kumul Minral and Ramu MCC Nickel mine, the study on downstream processing is complete. I asked him also to have a review on the process that has facilitated some of the mine permits thus far, mine licenses that has been issued, especially Oro and Mount Kare, those were asked for him to look into, progress of Frieda mine, as well as a special word has gone out that the proposed gold refinery concept that has been floating be stayed until we relook at the concept in totality. So those were instructions passed to him. “
Paita has also been issued instructions to look at the new mining regime.
“He was also tasked to look at the new regime that we've been discussing and that has been in circulation. The new regime, I just want to say, will not compromise investors' return on investment. Investors will have their place to make profit, but at the same time there will be a special look in the country, getting back more from our resources.”
The Prime Minister is also expected to review the current cabinet on his return from New Zealand with some reshuffle expected.
“And as I come back, I intend also as part of the review in cabinet performance, we'll continue run next week when I return, and after that entire cabinet review. Some reshufflings will take place with other ministers being moved to portfolios that I feel they could be better utilised in as far as their talent and experience is concerned.”
Marape said these changes are all in an effort to progress the national agenda, adding that him and the deputy prime minister are “not here to warm seats” as the nation faces its 50th anniversary."
Morobe Northern Highway project set for launch,25/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3728,"They have been neglected for decades, despite the Wau gold rush in the 1920s and the Garaina Tea Plantation in the 1960s.
Today (March 25th), Bapi village, in Wau-Waria’s Garaina Valley, will host a historic and ambitious Morobe Northern Highway project groundbreaking.
This missing road link will connect the people of Waria, Ono and Goilala to Wau, Lae and the Highlands Highway.
It was described as a dream that the late William Samb (former Goilala MP) and Sam Basil Snr (former Bulolo MP) once had; to connect their people to the main highways and facilitate the movement of fresh produce from the fertile soils of Goilala and Garaina to hoteliers and shops in the city.
Wau-Waria’s MP, Marsh Narewec, is taking the lead to connect the provinces of Morobe and Northern.
He described the initiative as “transformative”, saying: “The proposed Morobe Northern Highway will bridge Wau in Morobe Province to Popondetta in Oro Province, extending further to Abau in Central Province.
“Recognised as the ‘Northern Economic Corridor’ under the PNG Development Strategic Plan 2030, this vital infrastructure will traverse the rugged hinterlands of Biaru and Waria before descending into the fertile grasslands of the Garaina Valley.”
Narewec outlined that the project builds on the efforts of past Bulolo leaders; from the late Mathew Bendum to the late Sam Basil, who advanced the pilot track to Topai Mountain.
“The Wau Waria District Development Authority Works Unit recently extended this track to Bapi Village, overcoming formidable challenges posed by the terrain, weather, and the 100-kilometre distance from Wau Town,” outlined Narewec.
“While the District Works Unit continues to forge pilot tracks, contractors under the Connect PNG program, such as Tiare Construction, are upgrading these routes to rural Level 3 standard roads.”
The first-term MP has issued an invite to the people of Ono and Goilala to join him and his electorate at Bapi village tomorrow morning to conduct an official groundbreaking for the highway."

According to Marape, on October 31st, 2012, an instruction through a memo was issued to Yafai and former Finance Secretary Steven Gibson to stop outstanding payments to the law firm. Marape is the author of the Memo.
However, when made known that the first payment of K14 million was paid on November 1st, 2021, Marape held a meeting with Yafai and Gibson, to explain why the instruction was superseded.
At that time Marape had written another instruction to stop outstanding payments to the law firm.  So, it was about two instructions made at that time by Marape to stop the payments.
Gibson and Yafai were suspended from office and instructed to provide a statement as to how this payment was made.
Marape said in Court that he was instructed by former Prime Minister Peter O’Neill who was the PM at that time to stop payments.
The lawyer representing Yafai told Marape that there is evidence put before the court that the payment made to the Paraka law firm was taken out of a trust account, which the finance department used to pay Paraka law firm.
In response, Marape said that despite the payments being made from the trust account or another account, the fact of the matter is that instructions were on foot to stop payments.
After completing his evidence, Marape apologise to the court for his absence on Wednesday, March 12th for not appearing in court due to the Parliament sitting.
Presiding Judge Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika accepted his apology and adjourned the matter to a later date.
Meanwhile, about six state witnesses were brought to testify so far including the complainant former Solicitor General, Neville Devete.
Yafai faces one count of abuse of office and four counts of misappropriation for the alleged misuse of over K41 million, allegedly paid by the Finance Department to the Paraka law firm."

Hiritano highway needs immediate fixing,23/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3713,"Vice Minister for Works and Highways and Member for Kairuku, Peter Isoaimo, has expressed frustration over the failed rehabilitation works on the deteriorating road conditions along the Hiritano Highway.
“The highway, now riddled with massive potholes resembling volcanic craters, has become a death trap for motorists and commuters.”
On Saturday, March March 22, while on electoral duties, Isoaimo witnessed firsthand the bd road conditions and voiced his disappointment with the construction company responsible for the rehabilitation project.
He said the company, funded through the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program by the World Bank, was tasked with restoring the national highway from Vanapa to Bereina in Central Province. However, after digging up sections of the road nine months ago, the company ceased operations near Veimauri Bridge, leaving the highway in a perilous state.
Isoaimo said the neglected road has led to numerous accidents, including a tragic collision, witnessed by the MP last night (Saturday 22nd March) when returning from his electoral visits.
The accident, involving a Central Province Traffic Authority vehicle and a local PMV truck, resulted in multiple casualties and one fatality.
He said such incidents underscore the urgent need for immediate action to restore the highway and prevent further loss of life.
As Vice Minister for Works and National Highways, MP Isoaimo has vowed to escalate the issue, stating that he will bring the matter to the Minister for Works and Highways and the Department Secretary to ensure the road is repaired without further delay.
“The Hiritano Highway is a critical transport link for thousands of commuters, businesses, and communities in Central and Gulf provinces. The current condition not only poses a serious safety risk but also disrupts economic activities and essential services,” said Isoaimo."

UPNG’s Earth Science Dept boosted,23/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3711,"The University of Papua New Guinea’s Earth Science Department research projects were given a boost, with a donation of a 10-seater landcruiser vehicle and over K40,000 in school fee sponsorship.
The Mineral Resources Authority on Friday, March 21 2025, donated a 10-seater landcruiser vehicle and K45, 345.00 for school fee support to three Earth Science students.
In a small ceremony, witnessed by the Head of the Earth Science Department Associate Professor, Dr Joseph Espi, staff and students, the MRA Managing Director Jerry Garry, presented the keys of the vehicle to the Acting Vice Chancellor of the UPNG, Professor (Dr) Cecilia Nembou, and the school fees dummy cheque to the students.
Mr Garry said the MRA had been a strategic development partner of the Earth Science Department for a long time, and that the partnership would continue into the future.
He hoped that the new vehicle would be of great help and value to the school and students, especially in their field and research work.
“We want to give you that mobility so that you can go as far as you can, to see the different rock types in the field. And when you come back, try to recognise them, try to understand them. Because every piece of rock on earth is of use to mankind.”
Mr Garry said it was important that the MRA continued its support to the country’s future geoscientists, as they would contribute towards the sustainability of the mining sector in the future. He encouraged the students to start thinking about the sustainability of the mining sector of the country.
“When most of the current major mines, including Wafi-Golpu and the Frieda River Mine are closed by around 2060, the country would not have any new mines to continue to support the economy of the country.”
He said it was therefore important to support and prepare young geoscientists today so that they can meaningfully contribute towards the development of the mining sector in the future.
The students were encouraged to move away from conventional geoscience thinking and be innovative in their approach to deploying mining technology, to ensure the sector is sustained
Dr Nembou and Dr. Espi expressed gratitude towards the MRA for its donation and for being a strategic development partner for many years."

Bando highlights ambitious plans for the coffee sector,22/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3703,"The Coffee Ministry under the leadership of Minister William Bando is set to revolutionize the coffee sector to ensure funding reaches small holder and block holder coffee farmers.
Minister Bando revealed an ambitious plan where a Green Gold Card concept will be introduced to realize this.
K10 million kina has been earmarked for the coffee freight and price support initiative where farmers can access through the Green Gold Card concept.
When the coffee minister was asked today on the government’s commodity freight subsidy program, Coffee Minister William Bando was a little emotional as he described how farmers are not able to reach the markets due to dilapidated road conditions and went further to call on the government to prioritize these economic roads under the Connect PNG program.
“The epicenter of coffee is in Eastern Highlands and sometimes I tend to wonder, and the questions that are being asked on this floor, on the Connect PNG program that there are places in Eastern Highlands where 70 to 80 percent of our coffee come from, similarly to oil plam, to cocoa, to copra.
These are the places where we need to connect them up with roads. Connect PNG program funding is not a funding to connect one district to another within a province,” said Bando.
He also explained where the freight subsidy funds for commodity are being kept, saying this funding is with the Agriculture Department and his attempts to access these funds have been futile.
He then highlighted his ministry’s plans to introduce programs that will help farmers access funding for freight and price support.
“We will introduce what we call a Green Gold Card. That card operates on a similar way as the visitor arrival cards. When you go out of the country or any visitor that comes into the country, they complete a form called the “Arrival Form”. It’s the same principle but we will extend it to include the name of the village, the council ward, the LLG, the district and the province where that farmer is from. We will also include bank details of that particular farmer,” the minister outlined.
Every time a farmer sells coffee, whether ist green or dried beans to buyers, he/she fills out a form that will be put there by CIC. CIC then keeps all the data and will be able to identify who the real farmers, and provide them funding from the k10 million Price Support Money. He explained how this will work.
“Every month, that form will be remitted to CIC (Coffee Industry Corporation).
“That form will be lodged at CIC and CIC will enter it into a database that we’re developing. And at the end of each month, you get a print out of who is the real coffee farmer out there, that individual by name, by account details, by council ward, by LLG, by district and by province. So we as politicians, it’s a rare opportunity that’s been created by coffee that we can tap into the CIC system and then you get a print out every month and you will see who the coffee farmers are out there. And this can be emulated into oil palm, into cocoa and into copra.”
Bando described this as a paradigm shift and is certain this will work for the benefit of rural farmers."
Concerns raised about the delay of Porgera CDA,22/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3702,"Two members of parliament from Enga have taken the government to task over the prolongment of the Porgera Community Development Agreement.
Member for Laigaip, Amos Akem sought answers on the 14th of March last week from the Mining Minister about this subject. Yesterday, Enga Governor Sir Peter Ipatas directed the same question to the Prime Minister.
Governor Ipatas was concerned that the people of Enga were not benefiting from the Porgera Mine despite its reopening more than a year ago and sought answers from the Prime Minister on when the Community Development Agreement process would be completed and the people there start receiving benefits.
“Most of the cake has been cut. Now, there’s a lot of expectations – people think that there’s more to cut. I think that the CDA needs to be signed up quickly. The mine has been operating for more than a year now and people are not benefiting,” Sir Ipatas said.
“That can cause little bit of tension and problems so Prime Minister, if you can tell the people of Enga, especially people of Porgera and those affected (the riverine people) when we can conclude this.”
Ipatas questions come following similar questions that were asked on the 14th of March by the Member for Laigaip, Amos Akem.
“Wanem taim tru Community Development Agreement blong Porgera bai pinis?” Akem asked the mining minister last week.
Prime Minister James Marape explained the delay in the CDA process.
Now in that discussion of royalty as well as equity, the other three impacted sister provinces and landowners have a view that they also are entitled to a little portion of royalty and equity and benefits.
This possibly is one of the reasons why Mineral Resource Authority has been working to find out where exactly, they make the conclusion to giving respect to Western Province, West Sepik Province, Hela Province as well as the upload of power lines from Hides to Porgera,” the Prime Minister highlighted.
However, assured the governor and the rest of Enga that he would have an answer for them when he visits Enga next week to open the new Provincial Hospital.
“Governor, I want to give you an assurance – as I come for the hospital program in Wabag on 31st, if I have the conclusion of CDA, we would indicate there. If it is not, then in the moth of April,” assured the Prime Minister.
He also assured the people of Porgera that resettlement remains his government’s priority and part of the CDA will include this."
Solar Innovation Enriching Lives,21/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3700,"Deep in the lush green hills of Nambare in the East Sepik Province, Pastor Tania Parenduo and her husband Clement meticulously sort through cocoa beans in their six-by-five metre solar dryer shed.
As they work, the air is thick with the aroma of drying cocoa. For the couple, it is the smell of success.
For years they had dried their cocoa by heating the beans above a woodfired kiln. It was hot and labour-intensive work, constantly gathering firewood and monitoring the process. And there was the ever-present risk that woodsmoke would taint the drying cocoa, slashing its value in the market.
The solar dryer shed, provided through a partnership between the Australian Government and cocoa exporter Outspan Limited, has changed all that. Now they can dry their cocoa with much less effort and expense, and with much better results in terms of quality. Pastor Tania says having the solar dryer has dramatically improved their lives.
A lift in the quality of the cocoa they sell, combined with soaring global prices, it has substantially boosted the family’s weekly income, benefiting not only them but their community as well.
In addition to being a farmer, Pastor Tania is a community leader, and the extra income has enabled the couple to build a women’s resource centre, an early learning facility for children and a church for their community.
The tuition fees they needed to pay for their daughter to continue her education at the Pacific Adventist University are now within reach and their younger children now have bicycles to get to school.
""I am a happier wife and mother,"" Pastor Tania affirms. ""My workload has significantly decreased, allowing me to fulfil my other responsibilities more effectively.""
As a result of the Australia-Outspan initiative, 35 cocoa fermentary owners across East Sepik have been equipped with solar dryers, not only enhancing the quality of cocoa produced but cutting labour and production costs, reducing tree felling and air pollution and empowering women farmers like Pastor Tania.
Outspan project manager James Suanga and other extension officers have provided valuable training and education to support the rollout of solar dryers, equipping farmers with the skills and knowledge they need to increase productivity and improve their livelihoods.
The solar dryer project embodies Australia’s commitment to work in partnership to improve livelihoods and help foster a resilient and diversified PNG economy."
Law and order awareness for Rabaul students,21/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3698,"The Rabaul District Law & Order Committee has initiated a comprehensive awareness campaign aimed at educating students about law and order.
Led by the East New Britain Senior Provincial Magistrate, Samuel Lavutul, this initiative seeks to inform students about the different types of offences, their respective charges and the legal implications of engaging in criminal activities.
The awareness is now into its third week with its awareness team, which consists of police officers, court and village courts officials and the respective LLG social development officers.
The aim is to equip young people with important information about their rights and responsibilities as students, as well as address the issue of juveniles unknowingly taking part in illegal activities.
The ENB Senior Provincial Magistrate, Samuel Lavutul, when speaking to students of Malaguna Secondary School recently, stressed on the importance of abiding by the law.
“As students, we have to make sure that we cultivate good thoughts, be careful what you think as your actions run your life,” Lavutul said.
He pointed out that a juvenile is between the age of 10 and 17 years 11 months, adding that a lot of issues in communities are mostly caused by juveniles.
Lavutul added that the students or youths are the future of this province and it is crucial that they understand how the legal framework operates.
He further said by educating them on the consequences of their actions, they hope to reduce the instances of crime and promote a safer environment for everyone.
Meantime, acting Rabaul District Administrator, Freddy Lemeki, has commended the District Law & Order Committee for carrying out the awareness and said the approach is good in promoting open dialogue between students and law enforcement officials.
He believes the program will encourage a culture of respect for the law and empower students to make informed decisions.
On Wednesday, March 19th, the team visited Iawakaka Primary School in the Balanataman LLG of Rabaul District. So far, seven schools in the district have been visited and about six more to go before the team completes the awareness."

Speaking at the Maopa Levapuka Tovi Cultural Program, NCC Executive Manager David Taim revealed that the new policy and bill are designed to address gaps in existing intellectual property laws, which currently provide only limited protection for traditional knowledge and cultural heritage.
“By developing this policy and bill, we aim to provide adequate legal protection for traditional knowledge and cultural expressions across Papua New Guinea. This will help safeguard them from misappropriation and commercialization,” Taim stated.
Stakeholder Consultations in April, Policy Launch
The NCC is set to launch the policy in May 2025, following consultative stakeholder workshops scheduled for April. Provincial cultural officers and key stakeholders will be invited to validate the policy before it is finalized.
“By the end of this year, PNG will have a law in place to protect traditional knowledge and cultural expressions,” Taim said.
Recognizing the Maopa Levapuka Tovi Festival
Taim also highlighted the importance of cultural festivals in preserving endangered traditions, referencing the newly launched Maopa Levapuka Tovi Cultural Program in Abau District, Central Province. The festival, showcasing the rare Tovi dance, is one of the first cultural events of its kind in the district.
“This festival is rare and was at risk of extinction. By registering it with NCC and supporting its revival, we ensure the preservation of this important cultural practice for future generations,” he explained.
A Boost for Cultural Tourism
Beyond preservation, Taim emphasized the festival’s potential to boost tourism in the Abau District and the Central Province.
“The Tovi dance and this festival are rich cultural products that can be sustained and passed down to younger generations. From a tourism perspective, this can serve as a key attraction for visitors, benefiting the local economy,” he said.
The NCC has officially recognized and registered the event, committing to ongoing support and funding to ensure its continuity in the coming years. With cultural preservation and tourism development at the heart of its mission, the National Cultural Commission is taking proactive measures to protect, sustain, and promote PNG’s diverse cultural heritage."

CPEM recognize lack of teachers,21/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3689,"The three-day 2025 Pacific Education Ministers Conferences (CPEM) that concluded yesterday, highlighted several pressing education challenges in the Pacific region.
CPEM Host and Minister for Education, Lucas Dekena and co-host University of South Pacific Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pal Ahluwalia highlighted the closed-door discussions throughout the 3-day conference.
""Our biggest concern has been the shortage of teachers; the ministers are really committed to supporting teachers in the region. A lot of discussion has happened, making sure that teachers are recognized for what they do, and that teaching itself becomes, as Minister himself pointed out, a noble profession; that we must improve the overall quality of teaching and that we must empower our students to be able to learn from the best,"" said Professor Ahluwalia.
He elaborated on several approaches that were discussed during CPEM and how each country in the Pacific will deal with the issue of teacher shortage.
""There are several approaches that have been taken which (are) high level. We've asked the Pacific Regional Education Framework or PacREF to prepare more detailed papers so that we can consider this,” he said. ""There are all kinds of different approaches that are being thought of. One is to increase the retirement age, accelerating teacher training for those who already have a degree to take post-graduate in teaching so they can start teaching if they are not doing anything, and encourage more students to take up the teacher profession.”
Apart from shortage of teachers’, other concerns raised include indigenous knowledge, culture and languages, Artificial Intelligence and the deployment in ICT, inclusive education, early childhood learning, and pathways to flexible learning.
The next CPEM will be held in the Marshall Islands in 2027. Recommendations from CPEM 2025 will be assessed and progress tracked in the two years leading up to the 2027 meet."

Lae police confirm cell breakout,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3681,"20 remandees at the Lae Top Town Police Station escaped the police holding cell in between 12am and 2am this morning.
Lae Metropolitan Superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, said they believe a small hacksaw that was smuggled in was used to cut the wrought iron bars and wire grill on a window.
The remandees squirmed through the small, rectangular-shaped opening and dashed for freedom.
“About 20 had escaped but one was recaptured at the new temporary market downtown, today,” said Kunyanban.
“The cell is housing most of the summary (offences) cases; not notorious criminals. So, we had to verify the names and type of offences the suspects were charged with.
“As soon as that is out, we will definitely inform the public and confirm the figure of those who escaped. That will be verified later. As I am speaking to you, the team is going to double-check on the information so that it is circulated for public consumption as well as to forward to our hierarchy.”
The hacksaw that was believed to be used could potentially be attached to a makeshift handle, like a toothbrush or a small stick, and used to cut through the wrought iron.
It would have taken painstaking hours to cut through the bars.
“When you look at the opening of this cell where they had cut open, you can see that it was done over a period of time without anyone noticing until everything was ready to go and they went.
“The hacksaw that was smuggled in, how it went in, all that will fall back on the investigation. As soon as the investigation is completed, we will confirm how it actually happened and how the hacksaw was smuggled into the cell.”
Kunyanban said the discovery was made during the 2am cell inspection, outlining that the breakout was during a time when the police personnel rotate shifts.
Cells are not inspected hourly but at two-hour intervals, with Kunyanban saying the remandees knew the timing of the change in shift."
LLG Administration amended Bill passed,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3680,"Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed parliament’s passage of the Local-Level Government Administration (Amendment) Bill 2024, describing it as a critical step towards strengthening governance, accountability, and service delivery at the community level.
The Bill, introduced by the Minister for Provincial and Local-Level Government Affairs, Soroi Eoe, was passed today with strong bipartisan support, reflecting the government’s commitment to empowering local governments, improving leadership standards, and ensuring better management of community resources.
Marape hailed the amendments as a game-changer for local governance, saying they will improve leadership accountability, prevent financial mismanagement, and ensure greater oversight over local-level administration.
“This is a significant victory for the people of Papua New Guinea. For too long, weak governance structures and mismanagement at the local level have hindered service delivery and development in our communities,” Marape stated.
“These amendments will ensure that local leaders are more accountable to the people they serve, ward members have clearly defined responsibilities, and misuse of public funds is prevented through stricter financial regulations,” he added.
Key Reforms in the Bill
The Local-Level Government Administration (Amendment) Bill 2024 introduces several key reforms, including:
Stronger Accountability for Ward Members:
-	Section 11 has been amended to include additional roles and responsibilities for Ward Members (Councilors), ensuring greater accountability and transparency in community leadership.
Higher Leadership Standards:
-	Section 14 strengthens the qualifications of Local-Level Government (LLG) members, ensuring that only competent and capable leaders are elected to serve the people.
Stricter Financial Oversight:
-	Section 45 removes and bans Chairmen and Board Members of Local-Level Government Special Purpose Authorities (LLG SPAs) from acting as signatories to bank accounts, preventing potential abuse of funds.
-	Section 50 grants the responsible Minister specific powers to take punitive action against LLG SPA Chairmen, Boards, and Management if they are found to be misusing public funds or abusing their authority.
The prime minister further emphasized that these reforms align with the government’s broader vision of decentralizing power, strengthening sub-national governments, and ensuring effective service delivery to the grassroots level.
“The National Government is committed to ensuring that local governments function effectively and are responsive to the needs of the people.
“This Bill gives us the tools to address governance breakdowns, improve service delivery, and restore public trust in local leaders. The people deserve transparent, accountable, and effective leadership, and this legislation moves us closer to that goal.”
Marape urged local leaders, ward councilors, and provincial governments to embrace the reforms and work together to implement them effectively.
“This law is only as strong as our collective commitment to upholding it. I call on all levels of government and community leaders to take this legislation seriously and ensure that it is enforced effectively for the benefit of our people,” he said.
He also reaffirmed his government’s commitment to further strengthening governance structures and ensuring that Papua New Guinea continues to progress towards stronger, more accountable leadership at all levels.
“The passage of this bill is a win for the people. It is a win for good governance. It is a win for the future of Papua New Guinea,” Marape said."

“We got about 15 plus million-kina worth of census materials burnt on the 10th of January last year (2024) on Black Wednesday and it brought us back to some months of preparation. To prepare for such major events, you need to do preparations a year in advance,” Igitoi stated.
NSO did a brief to the minister on the 05th of March, detailing the costings of the census materials that were burnt during the riots.
The report to the minister stemmed from a separate preliminary report compiled by NSO’s Procurement and Logistics team. In that report, it was stated that NSO has a binding Storage Services Agreement and a Logistics Service Agreement with Post PNG Limited, stating Post PNG has been a major partner in providing storage and logistics services since it was contracted to NSO in 2029.
The warehouse, located in the same yard as Deshbesh Konedobu, was leased to Post PNG by Budget Real Estate. NSO, a client to Post PNG, stored its items in that warehouse following the demolition of Post PNG’s former warehouse at the wharf.  During the January 10 riots looters broke into Deshbesh and NSO containers. They looted all items before setting the place on fire. The census materials were procured through a NPC tender in 2021. Apart from these materials, NSO also lost census-related documents and files.
Post PNG Ltd wrote a letter to NSO on the 29th of January 2024, expressing sincerity and regret over the incident, assuring NSO that they have reported the matter to police and that police were working to hold those involved responsible. However, to date, no formal announcements of the incident were made, nor of any arrests relating to the incident.
Igitoi also confirmed that NSO does not procure insurance as it is not part of its procurement process.
“So we were not able to insure those things, as a matter of fact,” he added. “But the major procurers, when they provide invoice to us, they consider the insurance part of it because they got to import from abroad and it’s a requirement that insurance is covered.”
“For us, it was distributed by our SOE (Post PNG Ltd) and we expected them to have an insurance arrangement in place,"" Igitoi said."

PM reaffirms commitment to building new hospitals,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3673,"Prime Minister James Marape has reaffirmed his government’s commitment to establishing eight provincial hospitals in Papua New Guinea.
The Prime Minister was responding to questions from the Member for Hiri Koiari, Keith Iduhu during Parliament session today. Iduhu queried the status of the proposed Central Provincial Hospital since it’s launching in 2021.
The Prime Minister clarified that funds were already allocated to the Central Provincial Health Authority for the establishment of the hospital.
He further highlighted that the establishment of these hospitals is part of a broader strategy to enhance healthcare delivery, reduce mortality rates, and provide comprehensive medical services to local populations.
“By investing in provincial hospitals, the government aims to ensure that citizens can receive quality healthcare closer to home, which is especially crucial in a country where geographic and logistical challenges often hinder access to medical facilities.”
The Prime Minister also emphasized the importance of collaboration with provincial governments and local communities in the planning and implementation of these healthcare facilities.
“The focus may include not only building hospitals but also training medical personnel, improving health education, and addressing public health challenges.
“Overall, this initiative is a key component of the government’s efforts to strengthen the health sector, promote equity in healthcare access, and ultimately enhance the quality of life for all Papua New Guineans.”"
Neville Devete testifies against Yafai,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3672,"Former Solicitor General, Neville Devete in his testimony against Yafai yesterday revealed that Yafai had defied instructions issued to him and other senior finance officials not to make any payments to Paul Paraka as there was a Supreme Court order in place.
The Supreme Court had issued a stay order in 2006, stopping further payments to Paraka Lawyers and the National Executive Council also issued a memo also instructing Finance Department not to make any more payments to Paraka Lawyers.
Devete who testified via a video link from Australia said he joined the Department of Justice and Attorney General as the Solicitor General in 2007.
Devete said when officially sworn in as Solicitor General, there were a lot of controversial issues regarding brief out-of-payments to private law firms engaged by the state.
He said in March 2012, a whistleblower from the Department of Finance informed him about a K30 million that was missing from the lawyer's funding account.
Having this information on hand, he wrote a letter to the police on March 14th, 2012 , outlining that payments had been made without following the right processes. Another letter was sent to the Secretary of Finance about the missing funds.
In his letter he outlined the process of payment to private law firms, stating that the payments to law firms are done by the Department of Justice and Attorney General, through the Solicitor General’s office and once approved, the Department of Finance makes the payments.
He stated that these processes were not followed because the K30 million was paid without following that process.
Devete said when investigating the matter, it was uncovered that five different payments were made to different law firms on February 17th, 2012. All payments were done on the same day and Paraka Lawyers was one of the recipients of this payment.
Following Devete’s testimony, lawyer representing Yafai, Edward Sasingian said copies of the NEC memo and the Supreme Court Order were not attached to the letter to Finance, which Devete confirmed that he never attached copies of the memo and court order.
Yafai’s lawyer also outlined that Devete’s complaint was based on the K30 million and not the K41 million payment in which Yafai is allegedly been charged and trialed for.
Devete confirmed that he filed a complaint with the police when he was made aware of the K30 million payment and further requested the police to investigate the K41 million too.
Meanwhile, Devete completed his testimony yesterday. The court adjourned the matter to March 24th for Prime Minister James Marape to testify."
Marape welcomes passage of Fire and Rescue Service Bill 2025,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3671,"Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed the passage of the Fire and Rescue Service Bill 2025, describing it as a major milestone in strengthening Papua New Guinea’s fire and emergency response capabilities.
The Bill, introduced by Defence Minister Dr Billy Joseph, was successfully passed in Parliament on Wednesday, repealing the outdated Fire Service Act (Chapter 64) and replacing it with a modern legislative framework to address the country’s growing urban landscape and evolving emergency response needs.
The Prime Minister commended Minister Joseph for championing this crucial legislation.
“For decades, our fire service has operated under an outdated legal framework that has hindered its ability to expand, modernise, and meet the increasing demands of our communities. The passage of the Fire and Rescue Service Bill 2025 ensures that we now have a stronger, more responsive fire service capable of handling emergencies more effectively,” said Marape.
The new law introduces regulatory functions for fire safety, expands firefighter responsibilities to include rescue operations and emergency response, and strengthens coordination between the National Fire Service and other government agencies.
It also establishes a clear funding structure in line with the Public Finance (Management) Act 1995, ensuring greater accountability and resource allocation for fire services nationwide.
Marape highlighted the government’s ongoing commitment to investing in firefighting infrastructure, equipment, and training to improve emergency response times and preparedness.
“Our government is committed to building a resilient and well-equipped fire service that can effectively protect our people and businesses from disasters. This legislation provides the foundation for greater investment in fire stations, manpower, and technology, ensuring that every province—including the Autonomous Region of Bougainville—has access to professional fire and rescue services,” he said.
The Prime Minister also urged all stakeholders, including local authorities, businesses, and the general public, to support the government’s efforts in strengthening fire safety awareness and emergency preparedness.
“I encourage all Papua New Guineans to work together with our fire service to ensure a safer and more disaster-resilient country,” he stated.
The passage of the Fire and Rescue Service Bill 2025 marks a new era for Papua New Guinea’s fire services, reinforcing the government’s commitment to modernising essential institutions and ensuring public safety."
CPL's Water Project Transforms Lives,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3670,"For many communities in Papua New Guinea, clean drinking water is a daily struggle. The City Pharmacy Limited Foundation Inc.'s new Water Harvest Project is more than just a corporate initiative—it’s a beacon of hope for families facing water scarcity.
At yesterday's launch of CPL Group’s Distribution Centre, CPL Foundation Chairman, Sir Mahesh Patel shared his vision of sustainability and public health. The initiative will collect and filter atmospheric water, reducing reliance on municipal supplies while promoting water conservation.
For many, this could mean fewer illnesses, safer drinking water, and a healthier future for children.
Waterborne diseases are a major threat in PNG, especially for young children. With this initiative, CPL Foundation is not only optimizing its supply chain but also proving that businesses can be drivers of positive change.
During the live demonstration, stakeholders watched as the system transformed air into clean water. For those present, it wasn’t just technology on display—it was a glimpse into a future where clean water is no longer a luxury.
""At the CPL Foundation, our mission has always been to empower communities, improve livelihoods, and create sustainable solutions to some of the most pressing challenges our people face. One such challenge—perhaps the most fundamental—is access to clean drinking water. This initiative has the potential to change lives across rural Papua New Guinea,"" Sir Mahesh stated."
Wautogik Road to Success,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3669,"For generations, the people of Wautogik Village in Papua New Guinea’s East Sepik Province carried their hopes, their crops, and their burdens on their backs.
A steep, rugged bush track was their only connection to the outside world, making even the most basic necessities difficult to access. But today, thanks to a rehabilitated road supported by the International Labour Organization (ILO) under the EU-STREIT PNG Programme, life in Wautogik is changing in ways once thought was impossible.
A Life of Struggle Before the Road
Julius Yahapin, a 79-year-old retired teacher, remembers a time when every trip to town was a test of endurance.
“To buy basic things, we walked down a steep track to the main highway. Mothers struggled, carrying heavy loads—especially in the rain,” he recalls.
Farmers like Julius cultivated coffee, cocoa, and coconuts, but selling them was a challenge. Women carried their produce down the track, often waiting days for buyers to arrive. “Sometimes they never came,” Julius says.
Urgent medical situations were even more dire. “We carried the sick on stretchers down the same path,” adds Tony Nindim, a village leader.
For Nancy Watia, a mother of three, selling vegetables in town meant long, exhausting journeys. “I could only carry what I could balance on my back. I made about PGK 100 per trip, but PGK 20 went to bus fare,” she says.
A New Path to Progress
In 2024, the EU-STREIT PNG Programme rehabilitated the 7.8km Banak-Wautogik road, serving over 2,000 villagers. The upgradesincluded gravel surfacing, 22 pipe culverts, two slab culverts, a reinforced concrete causeway, and a bridge, transforming access to the village.
“Now PMVs drive straight to our homes,” says Julius. Buyers arrive bi-weekly to purchase cocoa, saving farmers the grueling journey. “Before, carrying goods limited how much we could sell. Now we sell more,” Tony says, estimating a 20-30% increase in farmers’ incomes.
For Nancy, the difference is significant. She now earns PGK 150 per market trip—50% more than before the road was built.
ILO-STREIT Chief Technical Advisor Eav Kong confirms the impact: “Transportation costs for cocoa and vanilla have decreased by approximately 10%. Villagers can now reach healthcare and trade centers more easily.”
Health, Hope, and New Businesses
The road has become a lifeline. “Mothers in labor reach health centers quicker. The sick get help in time,” Tony says. A daily PMV service connects villagers to Wewak town for trade, shopping, and medical care.
New businesses are also emerging. A village store has opened, reducing the need for long trips to town. “With more income from crops, this store will grow,” Tony says. Villagers are even exploring fish farming—an idea that was once impossible due to poor access.
A Mother’s New Opportunity
For Nancy, the changes extend beyond the marketplace. She joined the Road Maintenance Group (RMG), an initiative by ILO to ensure the road remains accessible. Since September 2024, she has earned over PGK 4,000, providing her with steady income for the first time in her life.
“Before RMG, I never made this kind of money. I bought solar lights for my home. Now I can sew at night,” she says, beaming. Her next goal? Building a proper house for her family.
A Village Transformed
Hope now thrives in Wautogik. Julius reflects on the transformation: “I’ve seen this village without a road. Now, with it, our future is bright.”
For the people of Wautogik, the road is more than just a path through the hills—it’s a path to opportunity, health, and dreams that no longer feel out of reach. “We are no longer limited by what we can carry,” Nancy says. “We can build something now.”"
Educate young men,19/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3665,"As Parliament continues to debate on gender-based violence and gender equality. Many MPs highlight the challenges of the issue, calling for a real solution.
Member for Talasea, Freddie Kumai called for the education of boys and young men; He urged leaders to introduce policies and programs that will shape our boys and men into responsible, loving, and disciplined individuals in the country.
Kumai urged the leaders to educate young people from an early age on respect, dignity, and the sacred role of women in society.
“Let us establish mentorship programs, strengthen fatherhood initiatives, and ensure that boys grow up knowing what it means to be real men.”
“As we confront one of the most tragic realities plaguing our beloved Papua New Guinea-the rising tide of violence against our women and girls. “This is not just a crisis; it is a moral failure, a stain upon our nation that threatens the very fabric of our families, our communities, and our future.”
Kumai said Papua New Guinea can rise to a standard of equal opportunities but it starts with every one of us.
“It starts with holding our men accountable. It starts with teaching our boys the value of respect and responsibility.
“It starts with us saying: Enough is enough! We must no longer be a nation that buries its daughters before their time. We must no longer be a society where women live in fear. We must be a nation where our daughters walk freely, our sisters speak boldly, and our mothers rest knowing they are safe.”
Kumai strongly calls upon every leader in Parliament, every father, every brother, every man to be the generation that ends this cycle of violence.
“Let us build a Papua New Guinea where our women are honored, our men are responsible, and our children grow up in homes filled with love, not fear.”"

Enforce laws on GBV,19/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3663,"As Parliament address Gender-based Violence and Gender Equality and Women Empowerment, Member for Wabag Dr Lino Tom has called on law enforcers to enforce the law in the country if the Government is serious about addressing gender equality and gender-based violence in Papua New Guinea.
Dr. Lino in Parliament today emphasized the urgent need for law enforcement agencies in Papua New Guinea to take decisive action to combat gender-based violence and promote gender equality.
“We cannot come into this house and present some floury statements making us look good if we are not practicing what we preached.
“Many perpetrators who commit severe crimes about gender-based violence are still roaming g freely without being arrested. “What are we doing in this house? Dr Lino asked.
His call to action reflects a growing recognition of the prevalence of such issues in the country and the role that effective law enforcement plays in addressing them.
By urging the government to prioritize these matters, Dr. Tom highlights the importance of a coordinated effort among law enforcement, policymakers, and communities to create a safer environment for women and marginalized groups.
Provincial Member for Northern Gary Juffa supported the call from Dr Lino and call for greater assistance to police officers to enforce the law in the country.
Juffa stated, “We have to enforce tougher laws. Let’s enact serious laws and address the issue, and also have a dedicated police force.”
In addressing gender equality and GBV a focus on human development was emphasised by Member for North Waghi, Benjamin Mul.
His call highlights the understanding that tackling these complex challenges requires more than just legal frameworks and enforcement; it necessitates a holistic approach that nurtures social and cultural changes within communities.
“Every crime created in regards to gender-based violence was done by a human being. If we develop a holistic human being in all its social aspects, he/she will reason out things and will at all times avoid creating crime.
“We must have ‘haus man in our society and educate our young generation on the values of human beings.”
Mul advocated for educational initiatives that raise awareness about gender equality, foster respectful relationships, and challenge harmful stereotypes that contribute to violence against women and marginalized groups.
He also stressed the importance of community engagement and empowerment, encouraging both men and women to participate in discussions and actions that promote equality and justice.
Additionally, the development of support systems for victims of gender-based violence, including access to counseling, legal aid, and safe spaces, could be vital components of this social approach.
By addressing the social dimensions of gender issues, Mul aims to create an environment where equality thrives, ultimately leading to a reduction in violence and improved societal well-being."
10 rescued after 15 hours at sea,19/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3662,"Nine adults and a baby were rescued off the coast of Bilbil Island in Madang Province after spending 15 hours adrift at sea.
The boat they were travelling on capsized near Basamuk at Tabalig Point with the passengers which included a one-year-old baby together with more than K8,000 worth of store goods after leaving Madang on Saturday at 3pm.
The store goods belonged to one Lillian Anir from Saidor who had hired the boat to transport her cargo. However, all goods perished during the devastating encounter. The boat is believed to have been overloaded at the time of the incident.
Boat owner, Kali Jerry, who is also a survivor knew the boat was overloaded and that they were behind traveling time but decided to continue the journey.
In recounting the ordeal, Mrs Anir said as soon as the boat capsized, she got her phone and called her brother, alerting him of their situation before the phone died.
According to the survivors, they drifted with the tide unsure whether they would be rescued or not.
However, behind the scenes, Mrs. Anir’s brother promptly flagged one of his niece who lived in town, asking her to source help. Fortunately, she was a member of the Madang Rapid Response Network (MRRN) watsapp group that’s dedicated to emergency situations in Madang Province. She posted the plea for help in the group.
This set the ball rolling as group founder John Ariku, and his administrators sent distress signals to the police, disaster and hospital for assistance. A similar call was made to business houses and individuals calling for assistance with a Search and Rescue operation. They were able to secure two outboard motors from Klaus Sarang and a fuel drum with assistance from Paul Rooke of Rooke’s Marine Repairs and Gary Litz of Madang Butchery. Another two boats were sourced upon consultation with member for Raicoast, Kessy Sawang.
According to MRRN, the first boat was launched in for search at 8pm and the second boat left around 8:30pm from Basamuk on Saturday. The other two boats in Madang town also headed out for the search, however, returned due to bad weather.
Search was once again launched early hours of the morning on Sunday, eventually locating them off the Bilbil islands around 6am and rescued.
They were taken in for medical examinations and according to Clinical HEO Israel Lebani at the Modilon Hospital’s accidents and emergency section, all nine adults were stable. Only the one-year-old baby who swallowed a fair amount of salt water had to be monitored but was stable too.
The survivors were thankful to the boat owner for ensuring they were all safe as most of the young men were from inland areas and were unable to swim. Mr. Jerry (boat owner) was swift in his actions resulting in everyone being safe. He managed to put two empty fuel drums under the capsized boat so that some passengers could rest atop whilst he carried the one-year-old baby on his shoulders.
They have now called on their member, Kessy Sawang and Governor Ramsey Pariwa to look into their dilemma faced everyday as this is not the first-time lives and goods worth thousands have been lost.
The survivors are currently residing at the Binan residence of Klaus Sarang and MRRN have taken the responsibility in ensuring their wellbeing. They have been taken in for counselling at the Modilon Hospital with the one-year-old and mother admitted for further treatment and observation.
MRRN is making a public appeal for donations to assist the survivors who have lost everything. Food items, water, clothing, hygiene items, baby supplies, fuel donations and even financial assistance is being sought to assist these traumatized victims return home.
Discussions are going on with Member Sawang, the disaster office and other stakeholders to better assist these survivors."

"Saii Kay Defends Music, Integrity",19/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3656,"Renowned PNG artist Saii Kay has responded to social media criticism regarding his recent performance in the Solomon Islands, dismissing allegations of misusing taxpayer funds. He described them as ""baseless and malicious.""
The backlash stemmed from claims that the trip, organized by Aelan Riddim for a music festival, was funded by public money.
“It is truly disheartening to see such comments when the reality is that artists like us rarely receive support from our government,” he stated.
“We have built our careers from the ground up, often with our own resources, and we continue to support each other. The notion that we are misusing public funds is not only false but undermines the hard work we put into our craft.”
Beyond the performances, the tour also included engagement with local students, encouraging them to prioritize education. “We wanted to inspire the youth to study hard and strive for their dreams,” he explained. “Music has the power to motivate and uplift, and that was our goal during this festival.”
Addressing criticism of his personal style and appearance, Saii Kay acknowledged the feedback but emphasized authenticity. “I accept the criticism regarding my appearance, but I must be true to myself. I come from humble beginnings, and I refuse to pretend to be someone I’m not. My upbringing shapes who I am, and I believe it’s important to embrace authenticity.”
He also called for greater recognition and support for the creative industry in Papua New Guinea. “It’s time for our government to recognize the contribution of artists to the culture and economy. We deserve support, not scorn. I am proud of who I am and where I come from, and I will continue to represent that in everything I do.”
Highlighting the potential of the arts to address youth unemployment, he added, “The creative industry has a lot of potential to close the unemployment gap in PNG. Not everyone is going to be a doctor or a lawyer, but there are other means and ways of survival in this country, and the arts industry is one of them. If I can inspire 10 people, then to me, that’s 10 less criminals on the street or 10 less internet trolls.”
Saii Kay remains committed to his craft and stands firm against detractors while advocating for the growth of PNG’s creative sector"

Pindiu driver apprehended,18/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3652,"Police in Finschhafen, Morobe Province, have apprehended the driver responsible for an accident that caused the death of three people.
Gagidu Rural Police Station Commander, Inspector Dominic Livar, said the 35-year-old Kote man was taken into police custody on the morning of Monday, March 17th.
Police say the suspect, from Siki village, was heading to a ‘haus krai’ in Onsesu village, in the Hube Local Level Government, on Wednesday, March 5th, when he lost control of the vehicle at Garenggareng, in Pindiu.
Initial reports said there were 17 passengers at the back of the open-back dark blue Landcruiser that was on hire.

“Farmset Farmers Training is purposely to assist farmers in livestock care and breeding. We have a lot of farmers so we are trying to assist them in whatever expert knowledge we can as we are one of the top farming shops in the country,” said Ernest Tagai, Farmset’s senior sales person in Madang.
Farmset is a locally owned company and sells equipment, feed and chemicals for piggery and poultry in the nine branches they have nationwide including one in the Solomon Island. They also have a factory in Morobe province where feed is produced and tested for local distribution. This enables them to have nutritionists and chemical experts who meticulously ensure that their product is up to standard and provide the best nutrition for livestock.
Local farmer Pius Bokorum, who started his piggery and poultry journey five years ago after retiring from Divine Word University was appreciative of Farmset’s effort to empower local farmers who are venturing into entrepreneurship. He stated that his K20 has given him the opportunity to gain so much more and wished he had known the information disseminated five years ago. He is one of the local egg distributors in Madang with his own brand.
“Food security is something that we all should contribute towards that is why I started investing. I’m grateful for this workshop in terms of knowledge gained today. I’ve learnt the dos and don’ts which will go a long way in assisting me with my livestock program,” Mr. Bokorum stated.
Mr. Bokorum encouraged youths and those unemployed to turn to agriculture and livestock as there are vast opportunities there to ensure food security, employment and stable income. However, he also stressed on the challenges that him and other local farmers have faced and calls upon the Department of Agriculture and Livestock and other relevant government agencies to look into their plight.
“I’m facing challenges with regards to stock feed for layers, our costs are high, especially for us local farmers. Our politicians are talking about big things, but they are not actually coming down to our level to provide needed support. I believe, the government should seriously look into subsidizing stock feeds for us local farmers so we are able to grow our projects,” Bokorum added.
The sessions were very interactive and farmers learnt the basics of piggery and poultry care, including daily feeds per kilo of livestock feed, disease control mechanisms, development stages and weaning of livestock and even artificial insemination which might take a few years to be practical in some parts of the country like Madang.
All participants were additionally gifted with bags of stock feed, piglet milk, shirts and information brochures on the livestock products and starting a livestock project."
Morobe police urged to check drivers,18/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3650,"The Morobe Provincial Police Commander is urged to check drivers and vehicles in Finschhafen district.
President of the Hube Rural Local Level Government (LLG), Kay Takiseng, issued the appeal after a fatal vehicle accident on March 5th that claimed three lives while 14 others received serious injuries.
A hired open-back dark blue Landcruiser was involved in the accident when transporting 17 passengers and food to a ‘haus krai’ in Onsesu village, in the Hube Local Level Government, on Wednesday, March 5th.
The vehicle already had 14 passengers – some who had travelled from Lae – when it left Gagidu, in Finschhafen, at 2pm. At Yanzung village, three more passengers got on with garden food for the haus krai.
On its way to Onsesu, the driver of the overloaded vehicle lost control around a sharp corner at Garenggareng, in Pindiu. It drove off the sharp turn, throwing off all its passengers.
Due to the sheer drop – considering Pindiu is one of the mountainous areas of Finschhafen – a female nursing officer at the Braun Memorial District Hospital, a 13-year-old Grade 4 student and his mother reportedly died on impact.
President of the Hube Rural Local Level Government (LLG), Kay Takiseng, is now calling on the Morobe Provincial Police Commander to check the drivers and vehicles in Finschhafen.
“We have a lot of unregistered and uninsured vehicles while unlicenced drivers are ignorantly doing whatever they want. I mentioned this when we had an accident in Christmas, where two lives were lost. This will be the second time that I am appealing for police to check every vehicle,” he stated.
“Vehicles must be registered and roadworthy.”
Meantime, the Gagidu Rural Police Station Commander, Inspector Dominic Livar, said the driver of the vehicle was apprehended by police on Monday, March 17th. He is a 35-year-old man from Siki village, in Kote LLG."

HYTARC TVET students receive laptops,18/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3646,"The Port Moresby Campus of the Highlands Youth Training and Rehabilitation College presented laptops last week to students who had paid 70% of their total tuition fees for the 2025 Academic year.
The TVET college took this initiative onboard last year and is now in its second year running.
It aims to help students have easy access to online learning.
HYTARC living up to its motto of ‘Making Nobody to Somebody’ continues to open it’s door to those who are left out by the formal education system.
Laptops were introduced to the college last year when some of their courses were introduced online. According to the director and founder of the college Michael Goro, introducing online classes makes learning easier for even working people and those who are in remote areas of the country.
Last week, out of the 500 students registered for this semester, 110 received laptops. These were mostly self-sponsored students.  Most corporate-sponsored students such as those sponsored by their local MPS and those from resource areas are yet to get computers because of payments delay from their benefactors.
Students welcomed this initiative from the college.
“I’m proud to be part of HYTARC TVET College, and I thank HYTARC for issuing laptop to those of us who had paid 70% upfront fee and I’m privileged that I’ll be part of the online training in this institution. And it’s like the first time for me to be in the online training,” said Adrian Newton from Milne Bay.

NDOH staff demand appointment permanent secretary,18/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3643,"The staff of the National Department of Health refused to work this morning over the prolonged delay in appointing a permanent secretary for the department.
The staff demanded that a Secretary be appointed to lead the department as Acting Secretary Dr Osborne Liko has been acting in that position for more than four years with no progress in appointing a new Secretary.
The staff will draft a petition and present it to the Minister for Health.
Meantime, Prime Minister James Marape in a statement yesterday said the National Executive Council (NEC) has rejected the Public Service Commission’s (PSC) submission for the appointment of a Health Secretary, citing serious breaches in the integrity of the selection process.

NEC also directed an immediate investigation into the appointment of the Secretary for Health.
Prime Minister James Marape in a statement emphasised that public service positions must be awarded based on merit, not political lobbying or personal connections.
He revealed that some candidates had claimed to be shortlisted and attempted to use that information to lobby ministers for appointments and warned against such practices.
The Inquiry will investigate how confidential shortlist details are being leaked and whether the selection process is being manipulated behind the scenes.
It will also focus on the role of DPM and PSC in the shortlisting and ranking of candidates before Cabinet’s review."

PNG Gov’t Committed to Bougainville Peace Process,17/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3635,"The Papua New Guinea Government is commitment to the Bougainville peace process, emphasizing the significance of the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement (BPA) and the necessity for continued dialogue between Papua New Guinea and Bougainville.
Speaking on Monday (17th March) at the opening of the First Joint Consultation Meeting with Bougainville Moderator Sir Jerry Mateparae, Bougainville President Ismael Toroama, United Nations representatives, international stakeholders, and other distinguished leaders, Prime Minister Marape acknowledged the historical journey that has led to the current stage of the peace process.
“This process was born out of the sacrifices of many, and we must ensure that the intentions of the peace agreement remain the foundation for our discussions,” said Prime Minister Marape.
“August 30 this year will mark 24 years since the signing of the agreement, and for 24 years, peace has been maintained without the firing of a single bullet. This in itself is an achievement that we must continue to build upon.”
Honouring the Bougainville Peace Agreement and Constitutional Process.
Prime Minister Marape reiterated that the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement is enshrined in Part XIV of the PNG Constitution, providing a legal framework for dialogue and post-referendum consultations. He recognised the dedication of those who negotiated the agreement, stating that their work continues to shape the ongoing discussions.
“I was not there in 2001 when the agreement was signed, but as Prime Minister, it is my duty to study the records and ensure that we honour the spirit and intention of the peace agreement,” he said.
The Prime Minister acknowledged the results of the 2019 Bougainville Referendum, in which 97.7 percent of voters chose independence, and reaffirmed that Parliament will ultimately deliberate and decide on the matter.
“Let me make this clear – my government allowed the referendum to take place, and we stand by our commitment to the process,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
“However, it is now a constitutional matter that requires Parliament’s deliberation and decision-making.”
Prime Minister Marape highlighted that Section 342 of the PNG Constitution explicitly calls for post-referendum consultations, ensuring that both parties engage in structured dialogue before a final decision is made.
“The wisdom of the 2001 peace agreement is that it does not impose a strict timeline for resolution, but it does outline the importance of consultation and agreement,” he explained.
Economic Independence Must Precede Political Independence
Prime Minister Marape urged Bougainville’s leadership to consider the importance of economic independence alongside political aspirations. He pointed out that 95 percent of Bougainville’s budget is reliant on external support, including funding from the PNG Government and international donors.
“Economic independence must precede political independence. The long-term sustainability of Bougainville must be factored into these discussions,” he added. “Today, as we speak, Bougainville generates only 5 percent of its budget. This is a serious conversation that we must address as part of the broader negotiations.”
He acknowledged Bougainville’s resource potential but stressed that economic structures must be strengthened before full political independence can be realised.
“My duty as Prime Minister is not only to Bougainville but to the whole of Papua New Guinea. We must ensure that any decision we take is in the best interest of all parties,” he emphasised.
Addressing the Risks of Regional Fragmentation
The Prime Minister also highlighted the broader national implications of Bougainville’s push for independence, warning that other regions of PNG may also seek similar autonomy if the issue is not managed carefully.
“Papua New Guinea is the most diverse nation on earth. We have over 800 languages, 20 provinces, one National Capital District and the Autonomous Bougainville Government. If we do not manage this process responsibly, we risk opening the door to similar movements in other parts of the country,” he cautioned.
He stressed that PNG must preserve national unity while respecting Bougainville’s aspirations, urging diplomatic partners and the United Nations to continue supporting a structured, peaceful transition.
Commitment to Continued Dialogue
Prime Minister Marape reassured all stakeholders that the PNG Government remains fully committed to dialogue and consultation, as stipulated in the Bougainville Peace Agreement.
“We have held multiple rounds of consultations, and we will continue these discussions in good faith. There is no rush, as the Constitution does not impose a deadline. Our goal must be to reach a decision that ensures peace, stability, and prosperity for both Bougainville and Papua New Guinea,” he said.
The PNG Government and Bougainville leadership are expected to continue consultations in the coming months, with further discussions on the political and economic future of Bougainville."
Toroama calls for independence for Bougainville,17/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3634,"President of the Autonomous Bougainville Government, Ishmael Toroama has called on the PNG Government to take ownership and endorse the independence of the Autonomous Region in this 11th Parliament.
Toroama made this call during the Joint Consultation Moderator Meeting today in Port Moresby with Prime Minister James Marape, Bougainville Moderator Sir Jerry Mateparae, United Nations representatives, international stakeholders, and other distinguished leaders.
“In the same spirit, Honorable Prime Minister, I now expect your Government to take ownership and endorse independence in this 11th parliament.
“Prime Minister, I appeal to you to take the Bougainville referendum results and pass it to the National Minister for Bougainville Affairs to present to the National Parliament for endorsement through this moderation process in the same manner the National Constitution was amended to give effect to the Bougainville Peace Agreement.
“By this action of the Parliament of Papua New Guinea, to amend the Constitution in 2001, PNG was probably the first independent state anywhere to have accorded the UN Charter right and principle of self-determination of peoples to its people under its domestic laws and regulations.
“We recognize that the sessional order is a process that will happen in the national parliament and while we appreciate the engagement in this particular subject, it has diverted our attention from the core agenda of the political settlement on independence.
“The referendum Independence result must be endorsed. In the spirit of the Bougainville Peace Agreement, the two governments can jointly decide as part of the consultations to reach an agreement on a bilateral relationship for independence for Bougainville outside of parliament,” Toroama said.
Prime Minister James Marape on the other hand reaffirmed his government’s commitment to the Bougainville peace process, emphasising the significance of the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement (BPA) and the necessity for continued dialogue between Papua New Guinea and Bougainville and acknowledged the historical journey that has led to the current stage of the peace process.
“This process was born out of the sacrifices of many, and we have to ensure that the intentions of the peace agreement remain the foundation for our discussions,” said Prime Minister Marape.
“August 30 this year will mark 24 years since the signing of the agreement, and for 24 years, peace has been maintained without the firing of a single bullet. This is an achievement that we must continue to build upon.”
President Toroama stressed that Bougainville’s agenda is independence and in the post-referendum consultations both parties have made it clear, resulting in joint agreements such as the Wabag roadmap and the Era Kone Covenant.
“Therefore, I expect that the moderation process will have to address the Bougainville independence issue,” Toroama stressed."

In 2023, Nasfund reported approximately 34,000 new members, and last year they added over 27,000 new members which is a strong indicator of employment growth, particularly in the private sector.
The Prime Minister reaffirmed that the government is committed to supporting policies that strengthen superannuation, employment opportunities, and private sector expansion.
Furthermore, he said as the economy continues to grow, institutions like Nasfund must remain strong and well-managed to protect workers’ retirement savings and enhance their financial security.

Connect PNG audit underway,17/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3631,"A special audit into the Connect PNG Infrastructure Programme is in progress, aimed at ensuring integrity within the initiative.
The audit is being conducted by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in collaboration with Norths Projects Ltd, a globally respected engineering firm.

Newcastle ends 70-year drought with win over Liverpool in League Cup final,17/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3630,"Newcastle United has ended a 70-year domestic trophy drought, beating holders Liverpool 2-1 to win the League Cup and spark a Geordie party at Wembley Stadium.
Local hero Dan Burn gave Newcastle a deserved lead in the 45th minute when the defender thumped in a header from a corner.
Roared on by a sea of fans clad in black and white, Newcastle took complete control of the match seven minutes after the break when Swedish forward Alexander Isak swept a shot past Liverpool keeper Caoimhin Kelleher.
Premier League leaders Liverpool finally mustered a response when Federico Chiesa halved the deficit in stoppage time but the damage was done and the day belonged to Eddie Howe's Newcastle, which won the club's first domestic trophy since 1955.
Newcastle was beaten two years ago in the League Cup final by Manchester United but from the start on Sunday it looked likea team determined to stamp its name in the city's folklore as it plugged into the energy from fans.
Liverpool on the other hand looked flat and appeared to be suffering a Champions League hangover after being knocked out of Europe by Paris St Germain on penalties on Tuesday.
After a cagey opening, Newcastle looked the greater threat although it had little to show for its efforts apart from a Sandro Tonali effort that flashed past the post.
Liverpool seemed happy to reach halftime all square and looked like achieving that modest ambition until Burn, called up by England for the first time this week, sent the Newcastle fans into raptures in the 45th minute.
The towering centre back, who returned to his local club in 2022, found himself marked by the diminutive Alexis Mac Allister and it proved a no-contest as he met Kieran Trippier's corner to plant a header inside the far post past the diving Kelleher.
It was Burn's first goal of the season and Newcastle's first at Wembley for 25 long years since Rob Lee scored in a losing FA Cup semifinal against Chelsea.
They did not have to wait long for their next goal and it came from a much more likely source.
Seven minutes after the break, just after Isak had a goal ruled out for offside, Jacob Murphy headed a cross into the path of Isak who quick as a flash swept a shot past Kelleher in front of the massed ranks of black and white.
Liverpool's first shot on target saw substitute Curtis Jones force Nick Pope to beat away his fierce drive but it almost got worse for a stunned Liverpool with Isak denied from close range by Kelleher.
After such a long wait it was never going to be drama-free for Newcastle and Chiesa's neat finish, allowed after initially being ruled offside, ensured a few thousand chewed fingernails before the final whistle ended decades of despair.

Bugandi notes academic improvement,17/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3629,"The once-problematic Bugandi Secondary School in Lae, Morobe Province, has noted significant academic improvement following a change in management in 2022.
Being one of the oldest schools in Lae, it dropped in performance and management, with constant school fights, ailing infrastructure, unpaid bills and no stationery or office equipment.
In 2022, Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, intervened and changed Bugandi’s administration and board.
Bugandi Deputy Principal – Academic, Monica Samol Miapu, acknowledged a shift in students’ mindsets when the Lae City Authority started building them new infrastructure, paid off all outstanding bills and worked hand-in-hand with the Bugandi staff to clean up the mess left by the past administration.
This also reflected in their academic performance, when more students from Bugandi started securing spaces in tertiary institutions.
“That made them to focus on their studies,” she stated. “Results have improved gradually for Bugandi from 2022.
“Other than that, to change the students’ mindsets, the management of the school with the governing council had to make a commitment to actually have students begin wearing formal uniforms. That, one way or the other, added weight to changing Bugandi, with the students’ attitude, discipline – yes, we have disciplinary issues – but it has been managed.
“Students’ performance – both in school and outside – have received positive opinions and views. Indications of students performing well and advancing to tertiary institutions; all sectors of the tertiary institutions, that means technical schools, universities and colleges. Bugandi is among students progressing.”
In 2022, over 60 students went on to continue their education in tertiary institutions. That number rose to 84 in 2023, 83 in 2024 and 79 in 2025.
Miapu further noted an improvement in Grade 11 selection. She said in 2022, over 250 Bugandi students continued to Grade 11.
About 400 Grade 10 students from 2024 have continued to Grade 11 this year, with Miapu stating that they now can fill up the eight new classrooms built by LCA, compared to the previous years when only six classrooms were used."

Police funds queried,15/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3615,"The Opposition yesterday raised concerns about the safety of citizens as the crime rates in the country continue to soar.
Deputy Opposition Leader, James Nomane the government cannot guarantee the safety of its citizens and asked Police Minister what he is doing with the significant funds he is receiving, amounting to millions of kina.
According to Nomane, in 2023, the government allocated 549milllion kina to the police department. In 2024, it increased its funding to 629million kina,  an increase of 15%. Total allocation in the two years is 1.178 billion kina. In the 2025 budget, police was allocated 703million, totaling up to 1.8billion kina for the police department throughout the 3 years.
“We haven’t seen an improvement in discipline, improvement in professionalism and standards in the RPNGC. We haven’t seen any solutions in police housing, improvement in police capacity equipment and conditions and solutions to the fleet management. We are still hiring. We are not confident we will meet the manpower targets of 7000 by 2026. We have lost trust and confidence, police minister.
“What are the problem that is affecting the Royal PNG Constabulary that is seeing a spike in violent crimes throughout the country and what are u doing about it?”
Police Minister, Peter Tsiamalili Jnr again attributed the declining law and order standards to years of neglect and called for an  increase in reservists at the provincial level.
“The culmination of what is happening today is because over a period of time we have not necessarily as a government addressed our policing. And so at this point in time, our priority is to increase manpower. We created the Bomana Centre of excellence to increase our police numbers, we have now graduated over 500 young police men and women and in the short intervention we’ve also started engaging with provincial governments to increase our reserve numbers. The increase of funds to police was the increase manpower - our personal emoluments must also be the same. K200million is for PIP and K400million went to personal emoluments.”
For the question of police using hired vehicles, Tsiamalili said it was a challenge from the supplier’s end.
“Our challenge with hire of vehicles we use one source of supply which is Ela Motors and they have a huge challenge with vehicles coming into the country. So, while we have purchased we are still waiting for vehicles to be in the country and therefore puts us in a position where we are still hiring.”
Provincial Member for East Sepik, asked a supplementary question related to the impact of the significant funds given to the police department.
“The correlation of the increase of our numbers and the interventions that we are doing as a government will not happen overnight. It takes consistency and efforts to address and get results not overnight. The policy is to increase our numbers,” he said."

She shared that the Central Provincial land board members immediately began work since their swearing in  last year, however  they are yet to be formally inducted, leading to delay in addressing crucial land matters in the province.
“I am aware that the terms of the national board chairman and its members have expired creating a significant administrative vacuum that is negatively affecting land administration processes across the country including the operations of the CP Lands board.
“How soon the chairman of the lands board will be appointed? What measures have been put in place to ensure that the absence of national lands board does not continue to disrupt land administration processes at the provincial level?
“Are there future plans for the government to consider amending the law to allow provincial land boards to function independently in such circumstances?”

Late ToBaining Senior farewelled,15/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3610,"A special East New Britain Provincial Assembly was held yesterday (March 14), at the Degenhardt Conference Centre in Vunapope, Kokopo city, to allow provincial leaders to pay tribute to the late Ereman ToBaining Senior, the province's first premier and former regional member.
The casket of the late Ereman ToBaining Senior arrived in the province earlier that day, to a brief reception program at Tokua airport, to allow a formal handover of the casket, from his son and Kokopo MP, Ereman ToBaining Junior, to the ENB Provincial Government.
The late Ereman ToBaining Senior's entry into politics was said to have been rooted in his activism, as he was a firm advocator for indigenous rights and decolonisation, under the Warbete political group in the province during the 1960s.
His political career culminated with his election as the province's first premier in 1977; two years after the country gained independence.
The late Ereman ToBaining Senior served as the Regional Member for East New Britain province for a decade, from 1982 to 1992, under the PANGU Pati banner.
Chairman of the Provincial Assembly and Provincial Member, Michael Marum, in his acknowledgement, said the late ToBaining Senior is one of the rare leaders in the province and thus the province is fortunate to have had such a great leader.
“Under my government, let us also lead our people in a such a manner, with dignity and perseverance, as our predecessors,” Marum stated.
Among the provincial leaders who paid their tributes was Rabaul MP, Dr. Allan Marat, who said the purpose of the life of the late Ereman ToBaining Senior, was for him to be a leader.
“Late Senior ToBaining was blessed with a wealth of information he absorbed through his own observations and initial discussions and interactions with colonial masters and fellow leaders from the province,” said Dr Marat.
“Later he established contacts with other fiery leaders of Kokopo district like late Oscar Tammur, Sir Alkan Tololo, Melchior Tomot, Sir Rabbie Namaliu and others in East New Britain Province, to enter the political arena.
“After his election, he established himself as one of the most distinguished pioneer leaders, committed and always having deep spiritual convictions for service delivery to the people in our province. And he was most respected for that.”
Political heads of Kokopo City and Sinivit LLG also paid their respects, while Kokopo MP Ereman ToBaining Junior acknowledged all those that attended the program, including former leaders who worked with his late father and are still in the community today.
“My father faced a lot of challenges in his political career, but he stood firm and tried to bring unity among warring political groups in the province. Governor, let’s leave something here to capture our province's rich history, not just about the government but also about those in the private sector that helped to shape this province,"" he said.
The speeches were followed by laying of wreaths and public viewing, before the casket of the late Ereman ToBaining Senior was handed over again to his immediate family.
A program was also held at Malapau for a cultural tribute and vigil, while a funeral service will be held at the Bitapabeke United Church today, Saturday, March 15th.
The late ToBaining Senior will finally be laid to rest on Sunday, March 16th, at his home at Malapau in the Kokopo Vunamami Urban LLG.
Late Ereman ToBaining Senior, who hails from Balanataman ward of Raluana LLG, Kokopo District, died at the tender age of 92, just 4 months short of his 93rd birthday."
ENB police challenged,15/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3609,"The police department in East New Britain has been challenged to use resources at their disposal to improve law and order in the province.
Kokopo City Authority (KCA) Chairman and Kokopo MP, Ereman Tobaining Junior, highlighted this at a recent law and order press conference in Kokopo this week.
Tobaining Jnr said since resuming public office in 2022, KCA has supported the police department with six vehicles and accommodation.
While commending the police department for the festive operation which saw a reduction in lawlessness, the MP also raised concerns with the Assistant Commissioner of Police  for New Guinea Islands, Naua Vanuavaru, about public concerns over the lack of arrest in many reported cases in the district.
“We spent around K2.7 million in assistance towards the police department. The problem is that no arrests has been made on criminals. We can build infrastructure but when there is lawlessness, then it is a waste of resources when facilities like schools get burnt down,” said the MP.
Tobaining was also concerned about the misuse and abuse of donated assets to the police department, and the actions of some suspected rogue officers working with criminals, tipping them off about movements by the police force, saying this is not helping to address the escalating law and order issues in the province.
The district has been riddled with community fights and armed hold ups over the past few years and the MP is concerned on the lack of progress on most of the reported cases.
“We need to put in an operations order and get those suspects arrested. The KCA has financed past operations already and thus, needs the support of the police department to address the continous lawlessness in the communities.”
Tobaining Jnr further called on the provincial and station commanders to “tighten up their belts” and provide leadership for their officers.
Meanwhile, he said KCA will also use the KCA Act to put up measures to assist the provincial government in its strategies to address law and order issues in the province.
Likewise, Tobaining Jnr called on parents and community leaders to take responsibility for the youths and juveniles in their wards.
“Law and order is not the responsibility of the government, but it starts from the family home,” he iterated.
He further said KCA supports the initiatives and decisions by the provincial government, and has allocated funding for programs targeting youths and communities.
The KCA also has committed to assisting the Kerevat Correctional Services with K200,000, awaiting the public accounts to be opened this month."
PM delivers ministerial statement,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3607,"Prime Minister James Marape in Thursday’s Parliament sitting presented a ministerial statement highlighting five years of the government’s achievements since assuming office in 2019.
Marape said on taking office, he pledged for his government to restore a robust relationship with their departments and agency heads.
“This was necessary in order to make all of us accountable to the advancement of our agenda to improve services and services delivery to our people by aligning plans to resources,” stated Marape.
He underscored that on the 28th of June 2019, a list of priorities that aimed to articulate the government’s broad priorities and indicators taken from the Loloata Resolutions was issued to all ministers as part of the strategic plan to guide efforts towards achievement of the same goals.
These indicators included economic, state enterprise, social, law and order and administrative services sectors.
“Heads of departments and agencies in these respective sectors were requested to develop practical, manageable and achievable implementation plans and to progress them accordingly. My department – Department of Prime Minister and National Executive Council, which was included under the administrative sector was of no exception.
“It has been six years since these interventions were initiated by my government. Today I am pleased to inform this honorable House of the achievement of the ones that directly relate to my role as the head of government and Chairman of National Executive Council.”
Marape highlighted that his plans were to;
•	Restore effectively whole of government coordination
•	Promote best practice for policy implementation
•	Review and update National Executive Council procedures and legislative requirements
•	And digitalize National Executive Council processes.
In order to achieve the above, Marape explained that it was important that a clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities were needed to be established between the Prime Minister’s Department and the Department of Prime Minister and NEC.
The Department of Prime Minister and NEC structurally has three department heads;
1.	Secretary of the Department, who is also the Chief Secretary to Government,
2.	Secretary to the National Executive Council, and
3.	First Legislative Council.
Unlike the Chief Secretary to Government and the First Legislative Council whose positions are established by an Act of Parliament, the position of the NEC Secretary is established by the constitution, Section 150.
Thus, following the prime minister’s ministerial statement, Marape presented a Bill for an act to amend the Prime Minister and National Executive Council Act 2002.
The bill was passed in a vote of majority by eighty (80) Members of Parliament effectively enacting implementation of Section 149, Subsection 5, of the Constitution to provide for the implementation of the decisions of the National Executive Council; and implementation of Section 150 of the Constitution in providing the functions and responsibilities of the Secretary to the National Executive Council.
Prime Minister Marape said, “National Executive Council Bill 2025 strengthens the process of bringing submissions to the council by giving legal effect to the National Executive Council handbook and its implementation.
“In addition to this, the National Executive Council 2025 also addresses the recurrent issues of unauthorized disclosure or access to NEC decisions. Often times this causes stress and anxiety among members of the council the government and the public at large. It could be perceived as a matter of national security when confidential National Executive Council decisions and national interest matters are disclosed to the public or those who are not meant to be seen.”
Prime Minister Marape further stated that the NEC Secretary has the functions of managing and coordinating all affairs of the NEC, assists the Prime Minister in formulating, monitoring and reporting on the ministers’ key result areas, receiving all NEC submissions and ensuring compliance with NEC procedures and assisting in the coordination and implementation of NEC decisions among others.
He clarified that these functions are already being performed by the NEC Secretary and the bill passed in Parliament on Thursday was merely an affirmation that gives recognition to the purpose of the NEC Secretary’s Office.
Prime Minister Marape concluded, “It is the firm view of the Marape-Rosso government that by capturing the NEC procedures together with the functions and powers of the NEC Secretary in an act of parliament, this will eventually lead to whole of govt coordination, bets practice policy implementation and achieving the interventions we made when we took office in 2019.
“Reform and restructure is what we must do.
“We must construct a government structure that is fit for purpose to carry our country.”"
Aloi takes office,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3606,"Following months of infighting over the Madang Provincial Administrator’s role, Daniel Aloi has finally taken office following the dismissal of the stay order that was preventing him from taking office. He arrived in Madang Thursday and was welcomed by government department heads, landowners, the public and Governor Ramsey Pariwa. A welcome ceremony and handing over of the keys to the Administration building was hosted at the Madang Provincial Government Park.
Last year, the national Executive Council terminated the contract of Frank Lau as the Provincial Administrator of Madang Province and appointed Daniel Aloi to replace him. However, Lau obtained a stay order against this NEC decision, preventing Aloi from taking office and he continued to act in this role.
Aloi then filed an application to set aside this stay order. His application was successful early this week with the court setting aside this order, which automatically rendered the NEC decision active, making Aloi the acting provincial administrator of Madang.
Mr. Aloi in thanking NEC was also mindful of the time lost and how it had severely impacted negatively on the provincial indicators for health and education amongst others. . However, he plans to work in partnership with the government of the day through the integrated development plan 2023-2027.
He reminds public servants that time to relax was over as from today and onwards, major changes will occur to steer Madang into the right direction.
Madang Governor, Ramsey Pariwa who was never in good terms with the outgoing administrator Frank Lau, welcomed Aloi and assured the people of Madang that he will work with Aloi to deliver services to Madang.

Unemployed face more violence,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3602,"According to the National GBV Strategy 2016 to 2025 Review Papua New Guinean women who work for SMEs, live on subsistence livelihoods and unemployed women face more violence.
Senior Advisor and Chief Technical Advisor to the United Nations, Vilupti Corlis, emphasized the emerging trend on which type of women in the country who face more violence.
“Women who work for SMEs face more violence or live on subsistence livelihoods face more violence probably due to the economic dependency it could also mean women who are running SME have to travel far with their goods and selling in vulnerable areas, which causes them to have a higher risk. Unemployed women also face more violence which is also due to financial instability,” Corlis said.
Corlis added that those aged 30-39 are most likely to experience GBV, whereas those aged 40-49, although fewer in number, experience the highest severity and frequency violence.
The statistics show higher education increases the likelihood of being wealthier by 98.6% but also increases the likelihood of experiencing GBV by 58%.
She explained, “So, the more educated you are the more you are likely to experience GBV. Those who are married at 25 to 29 are at higher risk of violence and those who are single at 25-29 are at lower risk. From a theoretical point, as we earn more income and educated, we are more likely to stand our ground.”
In comparison to 2020, there have been some important improvements;
– 20 provinces have current GBV strategies and 8 are PEC approved.
–  20 provinces have GBV focal points, and
–  12 provinces include GBV in their budgets, bringing the total of all provincial GBV budgets to K8,845,000 per annum."
GBV attitudes worsen,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3600,"The attitude towards Gender-based violence has worsened according to statistics. This was pointed out as an emerging trend at today’s National GBV Strategy 2016 to 2025 Review.

Senior Advisor and Chief Technical Advisor to the United Nations, Vilupti Corlis, during her presentation shared those attitudes towards GBV has slightly worsened and 64% of women in PNG stated they experienced intimate partner violence.
“Even though many respondents understood what gender-based violence is and that couples should not beat each other, some think violence in relationships are still condoned,” Corlis said. “Some say they hit their wife because of burnt food, children neglection and forced sex. 83% of men and 77% of women believe men have the right to beat their wives.”
According to the statistics that were shown, of the nearly 4000 GBV Survivors in the survey, 58% said they told someone, but only 12% said they had reported the crime to the police and only 8% of those resulted in a conviction.
It showed that although 8% resulted in a conviction, the response pathway is ineffective and perpetrators cause further trauma.
Despite these alarming results, 90% of women and 86% of men believe ending gender-based violence is important to PNG."

This celebration aligned with the 2025 International Women’s Day theme, “Accelerating Action,” emphasizing the need to equip more individuals, especially women with the financial literacy skills to train others.
The five-day program, conducted from 3 – 7 March, was designed to train individuals not only to improve their own personal financial management skills but also to become financial literacy trainers within their respective communities and organizations.
Among the graduates, 10 were women, reinforcing CEFI’s commitment to bridging the financial literacy gap for women and marginalized groups. The participants represented various organizations, including Commerce and Industry (East Sepik), Niugini Health Link (Western Highlands), Tuhava Town Management Limited (Central Province), Rhodes PNG Limited, Ipili National Limited, Taragai Enterprise Limited, PNG Eco Solutions, and Women’s Microbank Limited, while six participants were self-sponsored.
In his keynote address at the graduation ceremony, CEFI Acting Executive Director, Peter Samuel, highlighted the significance of empowering women as financial literacy trainers.
""Instead of having separate events, we chose to combine this graduation with International Women’s Day because empowering women in financial literacy is a key step in accelerating economic empowerment,"" said Samuel.
""Women play a crucial role in building strong families and communities, yet their contributions are often overlooked. Today, we celebrate their achievements and their potential as change-makers in the space of financial literacy and financial inclusion.""
He challenged the newly trained participants to apply their knowledge by training others in their communities.
""Now that you have completed this training, the real work begins. How will you take what you've learned and implement it? How will you teach others about budgeting, saving, and responsible financial decision-making? This program is about more than just learning, it is about becoming trainers and advocates for financial inclusion.""
Representing the graduates, Sharon Woruba emphasized how fitting it was that the training concluded on International Women’s Day.

Rita Kari, from Manda village in Western Highlands Province, admitted that before the training, she lacked awareness of her financial habits.

""This training opened my eyes to the importance of financial planning. I am now more mindful of my spending and ready to teach others how to manage their money wisely,"" he stated.
The program’s core objective is to “’Building a Nationwide Network of Financial Literacy Trainers” by developing a network of skilled trainers who can deliver financial literacy training in their respective organizations and communities.
By focusing on savings, budgeting, and responsible personal financial management skills, the program ensures that participants do not just gain knowledge for personal use, but become advocates for financial inclusion, particularly for women, youth, and rural populations."

“We’re also announcing now that we will be taking this matter to court and will be filing next week to oppose these changes as being oppressive and not in the spirit of the constitution,” Nomane said during a media conference following yesterday’s sitting. “(It is) restricting members (of parliament) and prohibiting them from exercising their right under their mandate to move a Vote of No Confidence in the prime minister and in that, holding the executive government accountable and ensuring that we have an opposition in the whole process of parliament and parliamentary debate.”
The Marape-led Government, using its numbers in Wednesday’s parliament sitting, passed an essential amendment to Section 145 of the Constitution that now demands an 18-month grace period after a VONC motion has been moved against the sitting prime minister and government, and proven unsuccessful.
The Leader of Opposition said, “So if there’s another Vote of No Confidence and this prime minister successfully defeats that, then the amendment to section 145 comes in and he will have 18 months protection before another Vote of No Confidence can be moved against him.
“By that time, it won’t be relevant anymore, because it will be 12 months before the issue of writs for the next election,” Nomane said.
Parliament voted 81 to 4, in favour of the bill, which, as a constitutional amendment, requires a two-thirds absolute majority of over 79 members for it to be passed.
The prime minister addressed a media conference that afternoon. He said emphasized the importance of stability in the work of government and public service without the continued interruption of VONC motions.
He said, “This amendment provides stability. It is halfway between completely doing away with the VONC provision and allowing it to remain.
“I am a proponent of keeping VONC according to what our constitutional fathers wanted. It is an important instrument in keeping governments in check.
Meantime, the Opposition has filed a Supreme Court application on the validity of the Private Business Committee’s decision preventing a Vote of No Confidence on 27th November, 2024. The substantive hearing gets underway at 1:30pm today.
“Court will decide whether to recall parliament for Vote of No Confidence or declare that parliament was right in its actions,” Nomane said.
The Opposition anticipates a recall of parliament."
Government borrowings not reckless,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3589,"Prime Minister James Marape announced that funds borrowed last year was not reckless and used within last year’s money plan, after an unsatisfied Member for North Fly, James Donald, questioned the government about their “empty promises” in his district, to ministerial heads and also about the money his government borrowed externally last year.
Member for North Fly, James Donald recalled that in the previous years, several ministers who committed their assistance to the district, never honored them.
“About four or five ministers I approached to follow up on their commitment and they always respond saying they are running on air and they don’t have money. Several ministers are saying their departments don’t have money. Why are these ministries functioning without money? Is this an indication that this country does not have any money? How comes we borrowed plenty money and this problem is still coming up?”
Prime Minister, James Marape in response shared that all districts are given funds, and encouraged the Member for North Fly to not rely on the government only but work together to attract private sector as well.
“Whilst we have budgeted for programs, sometimes funds are delayed and not remitted. I want to dispel the accession that we are not credible and trustworthy in honoring our commitments to departments, districts and provinces.
“Government funding alone is small in respect to these sectors to be worked upon. We allocate funding to facilitate the office and assist partners to have investment in the economic sector. Key partner is districts were land and people can participate in this sector. Every district has a 10 percent allocation from there service improvement fund for economic sector. Sometimes sectors get delayed funding or lesser funding.”
Marape also defended his government’s borrowings.
“Last year’s borrowing was not reckless it was within our last year’s money plan. Stick to this government to see that by 2027 we come back to a surplus or not. The last time this country had a surplus budget was when I was Minister for Education in 2010. Since then we have been running deficit budgets till now. To turn a big economy to clear water will take reconstruction in the economy. We borrow cheaply to refinance expensive debt. We’re maintaining a fiscal consolidation pathway to come back to responsible balance budget by 2027.”"
First Female takes speakers chair,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3588,"For the first time in the history of PNG, a female parliamentarian took the speaker’s chair this morning to preside over today’s sitting.
Member for North Bougainville, Francesca Semoso is now chairing parliament as the Assistant Speaker and is receiving accolades from colleague MPs in the chambers for being the first female to take this seat.
When taking the seat this morning, Semoso acknowledged the government for recognizing a woman to take the chair this morning, after 50 years."
Semoso praised,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3586,"PNG’s first provincial woman minister and prominent activist, Matilda Pilacapio, expressed how proud she was when she saw the Member for North Bougainville chairing Parliament today.
Francesca Semoso sat in the Speaker’s chair today as the Assistant Speaker, making history as the first woman to take that seat.
With voice breaking, Pilacapio said: “I congratulate her from the bottom of my heart. I say this with emotion. I’m very emotional to see her on TV today.
“All I can say is, she learnt the tricks of her trade when she was in the Bougainville government. She was a speaker back then.
“Certainly, she made history because no other woman held a speaker position in the provincial government system, only her. And then, to make it today at the helm, I had mixed feelings. I was surprised but not at all shocked. I was happy and I was on top of the world. It made my day.”
Pilacapio, who was the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries from 1982-1986 in the Milne Bay Provincial Government, recalled the days when Semoso was a young broadcaster who would invite her into the studio for an interview.
“I can tell you that she was very fluent, very alert, very articulate with whatever issues that were trending at that time,” said the human rights and environmental activist.
“When I saw her today, I was proud of her, very proud. I say this because we come from a matrilineal society, where women are in charge of the land. Milne Bay, Bougainville and New Ireland. I knew she had it up her sleeve.
“It’s five days after International Women’s Day that we had this historical moment come into play. And also, our golden jubilee; 50 years of independence.”
Just like Pilacapio, Semoso is a trendsetter; becoming the first Bougainville woman to be elected into Parliament in October 2023. Semoso won the North Bougainville seat in a by-election following the death of William Nakin."
PPL Faces Multiple Unplanned Power Outages,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3583,"PNG Power Ltd is responding to multiple unplanned power outages caused by Cyclone Alfred, which has severely impacted electrical infrastructure across several regions.
Acting Chief Executive Officer Ivan Pekaea confirmed that Port Moresby experienced partial power outages due to adverse weather conditions.
Affected areas included Gerehu, Downtown, 7 & 8 Mile, and parts of Boroko. The outages resulted from fallen trees damaging power lines, a faulty transformer, a burnt high-voltage bridging cable, and other related faults. These incidents highlight the vulnerability of the city’s power supply during extreme weather.
In Rabaul and Kokopo, strong winds caused damage to power poles and lines, leading to outages. The Ramu Grid, which supplies electricity to the Highlands, Madang, and Lae, suffered a total outage at 11:23 PM on March 11, 2025.
While Lae and Madang were fully restored on March 11 and 12, respectively, restoration efforts in the Highlands continue, with isolated areas still affected.
Pekaea urged the public to avoid fallen power lines and report faults to PNG Power. He emphasized safety as the top priority, with technical teams equipped with proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) before conducting repairs. Restoration efforts will continue as weather conditions permit.
PNG Power remains committed to ensuring reliable electricity supply and appreciates public patience as crews work to restore power safely."
Polye queries 2024 revenue target,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3582,"Member for Kandep, Don Polye, in parliament today, called Treasury into question on whether Treasury or the Internal Revenue Commission has reached its 2024 revenue target of K17.3billion and what was implemented afterwards.
Treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey highlighted that IRC did well, however non-tax components let them down.
Commissioner General of the Internal Revenue Commission, Sam Koim, announced last December that the IRC collected K17.3billion at the end of 2024, a milestone achievement.
In parliament today, Polye queried the Treasurer, “If the target revenue was met by the treasury, were the funds sent to all implementing agents to implement the budget appropriation as per 2024 allocations to various implementers like provincial governments etcetera? Why did all the institutions not receive the implementation funds and rectify any issues with the target revenue?”
Minister Ling-Stuckey was happy to shared that the IRC did well and highlighted on the components.
“I can say that they just about did with some very large revenue assumptions that were placed for 2024, they did pretty well,” he said. “IRC were projected to collect K16,158 million, the 2024 outcome numbers still need to be finalized.”
“IRC collected K16,094million a short fall of K164 million they were tasked to collect.
“Customs had projected their budget revenue collection to be K2,537million they were able to collect K2,482million shortfall of K55million.
“Tax revenues one of the two revenue components in our annual budget at K18,695 we collected K18,576million a shortfall of 119 million,” the minister said.
The Treasurer highlighted that tax components of revenues did very well, however it was the non-tax component that was a let-down. He explained and this is why several departments and provincial governments did not receive implementation funds.
“When you look at it, overall, revenues which we had projected excluding grants was K21,189 million, we collected K19,774 and therefore last year’s budget revenues were down 1400 and K14 million.
“So that was the many reasons why we’re slow to meet some of the commitments for various government and provincial governments.
“But the good news is as we close our accounts for this year, we were able to close those accounts in a way that was in line with our 13-year plan and without exceeding our deficit target,” Ling-Stuckey said.
The minister said Treasury and the Department of Finance have a detailed implementation plan and can report to parliament after the budget management committee meeting.
“From the total outstanding expenditures from 2024 which summed up K3,608million of outstanding from last year, we paid out K1,825million,” said the minister.
He said the break-up is summed up to K704million and leaves a total of K1,783million to pay out from last year. Treasury and finance have a target of paying all outstanding by May this year."
Parliament declares PNG a Christian nation,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3580,"Eighty (80) Members of Parliament (MPs) have voted to amend Papua New Guinea’s Constitution, declaring the country a Christian nation in the parliament sitting on Wednesday 12 March, 2025.
In Parliament, commending the successful passage of the declaration, Minister for Justice and Attorney General, Pila Niningi said, “Parliament made it its business to establish Papua New Guinea as a Christian country. Christianity came to this country, and that’s why stability is established. Now that Parliament has spoken, that one of the important religions for this country is Christianity, may God bless Papua New Guinea.”
Prime Minister James Marape commended this historic amendment to the Constitution in a press conference after the sitting said, “This law does not stop people of other faiths or religions from practicing their faith and religion.
“We place God in His rightful place. When we look into Christian ethos and theology it recognizes God as creator of the universe, world and our country. It recognizes God as the creator of the resource we have and the creator of our lives so this law acknowledges God and places God in His rightful place.”
Marape further highlighted that Christian churches have long supported the development of the country.
“I am happy. “This constitutional amendment finally recognises our country as a Christian country. This reflects, in the highest form, the role Christian churches have played in our development as a country,” said Marape.
Only four MPs voted against the constitutional amendment declaration of PNG as a Christian nation. These MPs from the opposition ranks included Deputy Opposition Leader and MP for Karimui, James Nomane, East Sepik Province Governor Allan Bird, Abau MP Puka Temu and Central Province Governor, Rufina Peter.
Allan Bird took to social media airing his views in a Facebook post stating, “Congratulations PNG 81 MPs voted to make PNG the Richest Christian Country on Earth.
Adding in the comment section of that post, “All our problems are now fixed by Parliament. You may celebrate.”
The passing of this amendment now introduces a declaration in the preamble of the Constitution, stating, “(We) acknowledge and declare God, the Father; Jesus Christ, the Son; and Holy Spirit, as our Creator and Sustainer of the entire universe and the source of our powers and authorities, delegated to the people and all persons within the geographical jurisdiction of Papua New Guinea.""
Additionally, Christianity will now be reflected in the Fifth Goal of the Constitution, and the Bible will be recognized as a national symbol."

Major amendments passed in Parliament,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3577,"The Government in a show of strength passed two major amendments in Parliament on Wednesday 12th March.
The first was an essential amendment to section 145 of the Constitution that now demands an 18-month grace period after a Vote of No Confidence motion has been moved against the sitting Prime Minister and government, and proven unsuccessful.
Parliament voted 81 votes to 4, in favour of the amendment, while the second one, which recognizes PNG as a Christian Country was also passed with the same margin.
The amendment has been a long time coming and is part of extensive work carried out by the PNG Constitutional Law Reform Commission in 2022 throughout the country consulting communities, churches, provincial and local leaders, and the civil society who have all agreed to have the Constitution make these important declarations.
Prime Minister Marape, who has always been vocal about the role of Christian churches in the PNG in tandem with government service pre- and post-independence, said today (Wednesday) was “happy” to finally see the bill passed.
Parliament voted 81 to 4, heavily in favour of the bill, which, as a constitutional amendment, requires a two-thirds absolute majority of over 79 members to go through.
Soon after the passing of the amendment to section 145, Prime Minister Marape addressed a press conference after Parliament rose to commend Members of Parliament for agreeing to the change. The Prime Minister emphasised the importance of stability in the work of government and Public Service without the continued interruption of VONC motions against the sitting prime minister.
“Our MPs voted in big numbers. This shows that a VONC motion can be moved but the grace period applies both ways. “This is a good law according to the advice given to Government by the State machinery, congruent with our Constitution.
“This amendment provides stability. It is halfway between completely doing away with the VONC provision and allowing it to remain,” stated Prime Minister Marape.
“I am a proponent of keeping VONC according to what our constitutional fathers wanted. It is an important instrument in keeping governments in check.
“But at the same time, this amendment will stop those without numbers from making disruptive attempts at changing government. In my case, I have stood up to seven VONC attempts in a very short period of less than one year.
“The MPs who voted for this law know the importance of it. They know that political instability has disturbed them and the Public Service machinery from working effectively.
“So as the Opposition, if you are successful in taking over the government, your 18 months grace period starts; but if you are unsuccessful, the 18 months grace period restarts for the sitting government.”
Prime Minister Marape remarked that his government had the voting ability to completely remove the VONC provision, but has chosen against it and settled for the aforementioned amendment instead.
“We could have chosen to completely remove the VONC provision with the voting ability we have, but as a responsible government, we acknowledge that Section 145 is placed for a purpose – to provide a check and balance,” he said.
He said the Opposition had its right to go to Court to contest the amendment if they choose to do so."
Parliament passes bill to establish new authority,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3576,"The National Parliament on Wednesday 12 March 2025, passed the Oil and Gas Amendment Bill 2025, effectively allowing the establishment of the National Petroleum Authority that will now replace the Department of Petroleum and Energy.
Eighty-four (84) Members of Parliament voted in favor of the bill, an absolute majority.
Minister for Petroleum Jimmy Maladina when making his statement in Parliament during the second reading speech stated that the amendment bill is part of the overall national government’s key reforms in the petroleum sector to strengthen the institutional capacity of the regulating agency to better administer and manage the oil and gas industry in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
Minister Maladina highlighted that talk of transforming the Department of Petroleum and Energy into a regulatory statutory authority to be a more effective and efficient regulator of the petroleum industry has been around for over a decade.
“In 2013, National Executive Council Decision No.145 of 2013, the National Executive Council approved and directed the establishment of the petroleum and energy authority. Following that policy directive from the government, a separate energy authority was created in 2021 – the National Energy Authority.
“Consequently, NEC decision 156 of 2020 directed the establishment of the National Petroleum Authority. That in 2020 decision was made together with the proposed production sharing framework which involves the Kumul Petroleum Holding,” underscored Maladina.
He said without having to subject the regulator to various fiscal regime models at this point of time, Maladina is prioritizing the creation of the National Petroleum Authority as an independent, effective, and efficient regulator.
“This will bring industry confidence, while the authority play a key role in implementing policies such as production sharing contracts, downstream processing and domestic market obligation amongst other policies of national interest for our country,” he emphasized.
The proposed structure requires the authority to anticipate a budget of K80 to K120 million.
Maladina added, “Revenue generation from petroleum projects are anticipated to maintain and grow two to three folds. That is where the proposed National Petroleum Authority will enhance its role to facilitate more investment projects and policies to create more benefits for the state of Papua New Guinea and its citizens.”
Maladina stated that as minister he plans for the new authority to champion the state’s agenda by creating more investment to support PNG’s socio-economic development.
Emphasizing, “In order (for the) successful implementation (of) the proposed petroleum authority will require adequate reliable funding to conduct its operations and work program on behalf of the state and the people of Papua New Guinea.
The authority’s proposed funding streams are:
1.	Parliamentary budgetary allocation and support from treasury
2.	PIP allocation from the Department of National Planning and Monitoring
3.	Fees and charges, proceeds from the petroleum industry subject to Non-tax Revenue Administration Act of 2020 and determinations
4.	National petroleum levy at a rate of 0.5 % on the gross value petroleum product exported to be paid by the National Petroleum Authority by petroleum only produced similar to the mining sector.
The new authority will be governed within the framework of the Public Finance Management Act and the Tax Revenue administration act of 2022.
Maladina further assured Parliament that, “The proposed National Petroleum Authority is a key enabler for the better management of the oil and gas industry of Papua New. The establishment of the National Petroleum Authority will be the catalyst for the implementation of the government medium-term development plan four – 2023 to 2027 for the petroleum sector of Papua New Guinea.”
Prime Minister Marape remarking on the bill in Parliament commended the minister on his efforts to ensure the passing of the bill, stating, “We came into office in 2019 with a clear agenda, take back PNG.”
He also assured that although replacing the Department of Petroleum and Energy, the new authority will not duplicate functions or create a new organization, and no need for new staff. The department will only be renamed.
“This set up of the authority is not only timely because we are now 50 years on. As a country known for hydrocarbon extraction. We need to move into this space, structures that carry us that doesn’t go well in as far as resource accountability is concerned must be relooked at,” said Marape."

NEC approves Palm Oil Policy,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3574,"The National Executive Council (NEC) approved the National Palm Oil Policy 2025-2030 during its meeting on Monday, 10 March 2025.
Prime Minister James Marape acknowledged the contributions of smallholder farmers, industry stakeholders, and development partners who played a role in shaping the policy.
The comprehensive policy framework provides a clear regulatory direction for Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) thriving oil palm industry, which contributes K2 billion annually to the national
economy and employs thousands of Papua New Guineans.
Marape said the policy is a critical milestone in the government’s broader agenda to achieve a K200 billion economy by 2030, with K30 billion expected from the agriculture sector.
“For the first time in our nation’s history, the oil palm industry will have a structured national policy that ensures landowners, smallholders, and investors operate under a fair, transparent, and well-regulated framework.
""This is about putting Papua New Guineans at the centre of economic growth and ensuring that the wealth from our land stays with our people,” PM Marape stated.
Key Features of the Policy:
• Empowering Landowners and Smallholders – Creates opportunities for greater equity participation and direct financial benefits from oil palm cultivation.
• Stronger Regulation and Compliance – Establishes a dedicated regulatory authority to oversee industry operations, licensing, and environmental standards.
• Fair Pricing and Market Stability – Introduces transparent pricing mechanisms to protect
smallholder farmers from market fluctuations.
• Investment in Infrastructure and Research – Implements levy collection reforms to fund smallholder support programmes, pest management, and rural infrastructure.
• Sustainable and Inclusive Growth – Encourages responsible land use, conservation, and climate-smart practices for long-term industry sustainability.
Marape emphasised that this policy aligns with his ""Take Back PNG"" vision, ensuring that Papua New Guineans are the primary beneficiaries of the nation’s natural resources.
“This policy places resource owners in a stronger position within the industry, enabling them to participate as shareholders rather than just leaseholders.
“We are setting the foundation for PNG to become a leader in sustainable palm oil production while protecting our land and environment,” the prime minister said."
Paraka’s bail application rejected,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3573,"The Supreme Court yesterday dismissed an application filed by convicted lawyer Paul Paraka seeking his release to pursue medical treatment overseas.
The application filed by Paraka on February 17th sought release from custody and grant of bail on medical and humanitarian grounds to undergo medical treatment overseas.
Paraka was convicted by the national court on five counts of misappropriation and sentenced to 20 years. He appealed to the Supreme Court against both conviction and sentence. His appeal against conviction was dismissed, but his appeal against sentence is still pending.
In the meantime, he was advised by his cardiologist that his coronary illness required urgent medial surgery overseas. He lodged a request to the Correctional Services Commissioner to grant him leave of absence from custody, and he also applied to the chairman of the License Committee and the Minister for Justice to consider him being released from prison on license to attend to the recommended surgery. After two months of waiting for a reply to his request, he filed an application for enforcement of his constitutional rights, seeking orders that he be released from custody, or release on bail, or that the relevant state authorities decide his request.
The relief the applicant seeks is about enforcing his constitutional rights under section 57 of the constitution, which he alleges have been breached, and has sought the court's interpretation. Order 6 of the supreme court rules regulates the practice and procedure for filling an application to enforce constitutional rights under section 57 of the constitution.
A three-man bench consisting of Justice Kinsley David, Era Kariko, and Derek Woods presided over the matter.
The bench dismissed the application for being incompetent as it was not properly filed within the order 6.
As to the first order for relief sought to be released from custody, the court has no power to order the early release of the convicted offender; that power rests with other authorities, such as the Minister for Justice under section 50 of the criminal code.
Bail is considered pursuant to the bail act, which was not cited in the application. To be allowed bail and travel overseas, the applicant must apply for probation to leave the country at the same time as applying for bail. This the applicant did not do. Therefore, the court dismissed his application.
Meanwhile, his co-accused Jacob Yafai’s trial will continue on March 19th, 2025."
MPs encouraged to be like Sir J,12/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3570,"Second sitting of parliament began with continuous tributes to Late Sir Julius Chan. Members of parliament who gave their tribute gave thanks to his legacy, shared testament to his belief, reflection of his contribution, and encouragement to be courageous and committed like the Late statesman.
Member for Rabaul, Dr Allan Marat, on behalf of the people of Rabaul and East New Britain Province said, “Much more could have been said in tribute for this political herculean, but it is incumbent upon us all now and in the future to take the baton of his legacy and with the fiercest of commitment and determination run with it. I ask who is similarly committed and determined to do so?”
Enga Provincial Member, Sir Peter Ipatas added; “Let his life and legacy inspire us to be better leaders, citizens and stewards of this great nation. Let us rededicate ourselves to building a better Papua New Guinea that reflects the vision and dedication of Sir Julius and our great leaders that have gone before us.”
Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science, Technology, and Sport (DHERST), Kinoka Feo, took the time to highlight Sir J’s contribution to the education system in the country.
“His administration saw the expansion of higher education through the establishment of universities such as the University of Goroka, Divine Word University, Pacific Adventist University and University of Natural Resources and environment. His legacy of educational growth continues today with the establishment of three new universities further advance in PNG’s intellectual and professional capacity. He understood that investing in higher education was the surest way to secure a strong and prosperous future for our country and education was the cornerstone of national progress,” said Minister Feo.
Member for Kandep, Don Polye shared Sir Julius’s values and how leaders of today should grab onto those values to better the country.

Coral bleaching evident in ENB,12/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3567,"The devastating effects of coral bleaching have already reached Papua New Guinea.
With global warming, over 90 percent of the earth’s heat is absorbed by the oceans. This stresses the coral reefs, and when under stress, they expel the microscopic marine algae that live in their tissues. They then lose their vibrant colours, leading to coral bleaching.
Local conservation group, the East New Britain Sea Keepers, have confirmed what has been predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
“NOAA sent out an alert, warning us of the severe coral bleaching event unfolding on our reefs,” said marine biologist and the founder of East New Britain Sea Keepers, Emma Oliver.
“Now, we are seeing the devastating impact firsthand at Ialakua Village. Coral bleaching is not just a future threat, it is happening right now.
“The once-vibrant reefs are turning white, struggling to survive under extreme ocean temperatures. Fortunately, most of our coral nursery fragments have managed to survive.
“This crisis also presents an opportunity to identify resilient coral colonies that didn’t bleach and incorporate them into our nursery for future restoration.
“The next few weeks and into April will be crucial as our team works tirelessly to save what remains.
“It’s heartbreaking to see the little kids swimming in waters where corals are being wiped out. What does the future hold for them if our reefs disappear?
“The time to act is now. Every effort counts in the fight to protect and restore our marine ecosystems.”"

Witnesses say payment records missing,12/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3565,"The trial into the Paraka scandal continued today at the National Court. Five witnesses testified yesterday.
They are former Deputy Secretary of Department of Justice and Attorney General Miriam Kias, National Fraud and Anti- Corruption Chief Sergeant Basi Sopata, National Fraud and Anti-Corruption Chief Sergeant Timoty Gitua, former First Assistant Secretary to the Internal Audit and Compliance Division, Tress Wingi and Department of Attorney General Case Management Manager, Christine Gemos.
It was before the court that a few of the witnesses provided an update as to how the allegations of misappropriating payments were made to private law firms including Paraka Lawyers.
The Department of Justice and Attorney General (DJAG) is the authority responsible for paying outstanding legal claims to private law firms. DJAG would send the payment to the Solicitor General for approval before the Department of Finance makes the payout.
The lead investigator in this matter is Chief Sergeant Gitua and the arresting officer is Chief Sergeant Sopata.
According to Gitua, a search warrant was taken out to access Paraka Lawyers’ account with Bank South Pacific, following a complaint laid with police over the allegations.
Gitua testified that they found that the payments were made to Paul Paraka’s personal account and not the law firm’s.
Wingi, former First Assistant Secretary in the Internal Audit and Compliance Division of the finance department, said the accounts payable section could not locate records of these payments, even though the payable officer stated that payments were made to the law firm.
Other key points the witnesses highlighted are:
•	The distributing of bills that were paid to Paul Paraka Law firm did not follow the right processes of payment as stated above.
•	There was a Supreme Court Order that stay the payment of outstanding bills to Paraka law firm in 2006. This stay order was not attached to the letters issued to DJAG, the Solicitor General, and the Finance Department for making the payment. Hence, the payment was made without the knowledge of the supreme court
•	Audit investigations found that the original documents of the cheque payments were not located at the accounts payable files because it was issued to Mr Yafai.
•	The Case Management System records show that there was no record of outstanding bills owned by the state pertaining to the Paraka law firm.
State witnesses are testifying against Jacob Yafai, former Deputy Secretary for the Department of Finance, who was implicated in the Paraka saga.
Yafai faces one count of abuse of office and four counts of misappropriation for the alleged misuse of over K41 million, allegedly paid by the Finance Department to Paraka Lawyers.
The four courts of misappropriation are;
1.	K14 million, on November 1, 2012
2.	K13.8 million on December 20, 2013
3.	K6 million on March 15, 2023, and
4.	K8 million on May 3, 2013
Of the 23 witnesses, 7 are deceased."
CJ annoyed over PM’s no-show in court,12/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3564,"Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea and presiding judge in the Paraka scandal case, Sir Gibbs Salika, was disappointed with the state for not ensuring that Prime Minister James Marape, a state witness in the Paraka scandal, appeared in court today to testify.
The prime minister instead, attended to parliament duties. He was listed to testify today against Jacob Yafai, former Deputy Secretary for the Department of Finance, who is implicated in the Paraka scandal.
Lawyer representing the state made an application to the court, stating the reasons why the prime minister was not in court, and asked the court to allow Mr Marape to appear on March 24th, 2025.
The Chief Justice said, “That (has) never been my plan to extend this trial to the 24th. My plan was to complete this trial on Friday of this week. I will not extend for the convenience of the state or sit around for the next two weeks. In my court, once a matter is started, it started; I do not do start stop business.
“You had Monday to call him in. Parliament will meet on Tuesday of this week. To bring him now, it's not going to be possible because he is in parliament,” Salika said.
Also on the state witness list is Neville Devete, the complainant in the matter. Devete is in Tennant Creek, Australia, and will give his evidence via Zoom on March 19th, 2025.
According to the state, it will take Devete a week to travel by road to Darwin to utilize the office of the Public Prosecutor to give evidence over the internet.
The state further stated that Sinasina Yonggomugl MP, Karenga Kua, will be called in to testify as well.
Due to the unavailability of witnesses, the state submitted for an adjournment. However, the defendant’s lawyer objected to the submission, stating that his client was charged in 2013 and has a right to a fair trial.
After hearing submissions from both parties, Salika adjourned the trial to March 19th, when Devete will testify. Sir Gibbs said Mr Marape and Mr Kua will testify on March 24th."

Five new chambers opened,12/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3562,"About five new chambers of the National and Supreme Court refurbished by local contractors were officially opened today by the Australian High Commissioner John Feakes and PNG Chief Justice, Sir Gibbs Salika.
The project was implemented in partnership with the PNG and Australian government through the Australia High Commission and the National Judiciary Staff Services. It cost about K1.7 million to complete the project.
The project began in December 2024 and was completed in February of this year.
The official program started with a keynote address by Mr Feakes and Justice Salika, followed by the unveiling of the plaque and a tour of the chambers.
According to Justice Salika, the objective of initiating the new chambers is due to the shortage of chambers that can accommodate judges. Currently, there are about 10 chambers, which cannot cater for the 42 judges of the national and supreme court.
“I suggested this project because we recruit additional judges and for the other factor that when judges come here for the supreme court sitting, we don’t have enough chambers to cater for them.
“More than two judges are sharing one chamber while the supreme court is sitting, so having additional chambers will cater for them too,” he said.
Salika thanked the people of Australia for the support that will contribute meaningfully to the development of the law and justice sector of PNG.
Australian High Commissioner Feakes said the partnership between Australia and PNG through this project signifies an unwavering commitment to justice and the rule of law.
He said the collaboration reflects Australians' mutual desire to strengthen judicial systems in Port Moresby and other provinces in Papua New Guinea as well."

"Over 1,000 passports printed in Lae",12/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3557,"Over 1,300 passports have been printed and issued in Lae by the Papua New Guinea Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority (PNG ICSA) since December 2024.
The passport office at the Nambawan Super building, in Top Town Lae, within the PNG ICSA Morobe Regional Office, was officially opened on December 23 last year by the Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso.
To date, it has printed and issued 1,386 passports.
“Passport applications are being received from Morobe Province, and other provinces including those from the Highlands,” said Rosso.
“Lae is our country’s second largest city, and is in a central location that is more easily accessible by many provinces, and for this reason, it was selected as the first place outside of Port Moresby to print passports.
Rosso, who is also responsible for the Immigration and Border Security Ministry, said government services must be decentralised to reach as many people as possible.
In 2016, the Chief Migration Officer, Wellington Navasivu, was the Assistant Manager of the Morobe Regional Office.
“I played an important role in establishing the Morobe Regional Office in Lae about nine years ago, and in 2024, as the Chief Migration Officer, to also be able to set up and open the Passport Office there is special,” Navasivu stated.
“The new facility is helping to address any delays that may have been experienced in the past because all applications for standard passports lodged in Lae can be registered and printed there instead of in Port Moresby.”"

Sawang shines light on a grim truth - education and opportunity in PNG,11/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3547,"Education is a rare privilege and must be embraced. This was the message from the Labor and Employment Minister, Kessy Sawang to the graduating students of Divine Word University last Friday.
“Yes, less than one percent - let that sink in. You belong to an extraordinary minority. The most recent census, conducted last year, will reveal whether we have made progress, but the reality remains, education is a rare privilege in Papua New Guinea,” said Member for Raicoast and Minister for Labor & Employment Kessy Sawang who was the keynote speaker during the 43rd Divine Word Graduation at the Pope John Paul Hall.
She drove home this message to the graduands about their privilege and responsibility in having tertiary education and qualification, adding that the knowledge gained must be utilized to serve, uplift and transform the nation.
“Let me share with you the weight of the honor that has been bestowed upon you. Many in our beloved Papua New Guinea experience poverty in opportunities to pursue education. Consider these sobering statistics from the 2011 Census:
•	Only 6.6% of the population (aged 5 and above) attained a grade 12 qualification
•	Those with a tertiary qualification (vocational, teacher’s colleges, health, business, technical, apprenticeship) account for merely 3%
•	And here is the most staggering figure, less than 1% of Papua New Guineans hold a university degree,” she added.
Minister Sawang encouraged the 761 graduating students that there is greatness that comes with having the responsibility. That in some instances there will be a few that may be required to do more in their field of work more than others. She advised them to take on whatever challenges their role portrays in each workplace and rise to the occasion as patriotic citizens of the country.
Furthermore, she encouraged them to see the opportunities that lie ahead despite the uncertainties, by showcasing their knowledge, values and spirit of service that can transform their communities and nation.
“I urge you to live with integrity, lead with compassion and embrace the richness of your cultural heritage and Christian faith. The true mark of a leader is not in how high they rise, but in how many others they uplift along the way. Be the generation that fosters unity, drives progress and ensures that no one is left behind. In a world that often prioritizes personal gain over collective well-being, you must be different. The Christian principles instilled in you of integrity, humility, compassion and service must guide you as you step forward. Carry them with pride and let them shape your actions, decisions and leadership,” Sawang stated."

CLRC to preserve iconic Constitutional House,11/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3544,"The Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) is currently in discussions with the University of Papua New Guinea regarding a potential restoration and redevelopment of the historic Constitutional House located on Motupore Island.
“These discussions are still in the infant stages, and no final decisions, or agreements have been made at this time,” Secretary Dr. Mange Matui said.
Secretary was responding to a news article that appeared in a daily newspaper recently, concerning the state of the Constitution House. Secretary Matui, acknowledged the concerns raised in the news article, and agreed that something needs be done about the building.
CLRC’s negotiation with UPNG as the caretaker and owner of the site and building will hopefully result in a formal understanding between the two institutions, aimed at preserving the site for educational purposes and to honour its historical significance for future generations.
This collaboration with UPNG is important to ensure CLRC has the necessary space and organize resources to begin restoration work of the building.
As the country excels towards its 50th Independence Anniversary, it is fitting that such high esteem building be recognized and declared as a monument of historical importance while featuring as part of the Independence celebrations.
The CLRC recognizes the historical importance of the Constitutional House, given its inspiring nature as the designated site where the forefathers as members of the Constitutional Planning Committee (CPC) normally met and crafted the Constitution before it was adopted by the Constituent Assembly in September 1972.
The CPC was instrumental in guiding and facilitating the creation of a Constitution that would serve as the legal foundation for an independent Papua New Guinea, as well as designing legal, political and governance structures, and consultations and the decolonization process, tasks CLRC continues to carry out daily as part of its mandate as the only law reform agency of PNG."
French Navy vessel makes a memorable stop on Yule Island,11/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3542,"On Saturday 8th of March, a French navy vessel based in New Caledonia, the Frigate “Vendemiaire”, anchored at Yule Island in Central Province to carry out a memorial action through the cleaning and restoration of the grave of Lieutenant Léon Bourjade, a French flying ace in the First World War who died in 1924 on the island where he later became a missionary.
Famous for his ""acrobatic"" landings, his name is still associated with aviation through the expression ""landing like Bourjade"".
A ceremony was held in the presence of European Union Ambassador Jacques Fradin, French Deputy Head of Mission Khouira Drault, Managing Director of TotalEnergies Arnaud Berthet, Operations Director for TotalEnergies Eric Casse, Captain of the “Vendemiaire” Gauthier Guillaumat and his crew, and dignitaries of the island and their community leaders. The island's residents also turned out to attend the event.
It was not the first time that French officials and militaries paid tribute to the Lieutenant on Yule Island, many military vessels used to stop over there in the past. Last year, this tradition was revived when the French Navy Vessel “Auguste Benebig” came.
This year, it was the 101th year of Lieutenant Bourjade’s death on Yule Island. Captain Guillaumat, the officers and sailors of the ""Vendemiaire"" were very touched by the warm welcome they received and are proud to have been able to perpetuate this tradition of the French Navy.
The French Navy is part of the French Armed forces in New Caledonia (FANC); FANC enable France to have permanent military presence in the South Pacific in order to protect French interests in the region and maintain France's military partnerships in this area of strategic interest. With more than 1,650 military personnel, the FANC provide regular support for missions involving government action at sea. They have the capacity to intervene in the event of a security or climatic crisis affecting the area. The FANC regularly share their expertise in the field of HADR and maritime security with the security and defense forces of partner countries in the South Pacific.
As such, France, alongside PNG, is an actor of the regional security, for a free, safe and secured, prosperous and sustainable Pacific, and in particular South Pacific."

ENB loses pioneer premier,11/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3539,"East New Britain province has lost one of its most prominent and respected figures in politics with the passing of former Premier and Regional Member, Patuana Ereman Vin ToBaining. He died peacefully at his residence in Malapau, Kokopo, on February 24, 2025, at the age of 93. ToBaining's legacy lives on through his youngest son, Ereman ToBaining Jnr, who currently serves as the Open Member for Kokopo.
ToBaining's political journey began when he was first elected as the Premier of East New Britain province in May 1977, although he was soon replaced due to a compromise with the powerful Mataungan hardliners, who exerted significant influence over the Provincial Assembly, ToBaining continued to make his mark in the assembly, serving as Minister for Finance, Transport, and Works. He was later elected Premier again in September 1979, serving until his resignation in 1980.
His commitment to public service did not wane, as he continued to represent the Raluana district until April 1982 when he set his sights on national politics.
In June 1982, he was elected as the Regional Member of Parliament for East New Britain province, securing re-election in 1987 and serving until June 1992, when he was unable to garner the support of the Pangu Party for his continued tenure.
Tragedy struck ToBaining in 1988 with the passing of his eldest son, Kepas, followed closely by the loss of his beloved wife, Relvie, shortly after his election defeat in June 1992. These personal losses deeply affected him, leading him to withdraw from the political arena and allowing the younger generation to take the reins.
In his later years, ToBaining chose a quieter lifestyle in his home at Malapau, where he lived peacefully until his death. He left behind a legacy of political integrity and dedication to his province and its people.
Born to humble beginnings, Patuana Ereman Vin ToBaining was the son of Vin Ereman Tene, who served as a village police officer (Luluai) under both the German and Australian colonial administrations. ToBaining's early experiences with colonial governance instilled in him a sense of discipline, order, and a commitment to public service.
He completed Form 3 education at Bitapetep Lukbuk School but ultimately chose to follow in his father's footsteps rather than continue his academic pursuits, focusing on community service and leadership.
ToBaining was a father to seven children—five boys and two girls—Kepas, Piniana, Michael, Robert, Rubbie, and Ereman ToBaining Jnr. He also leaves behind a legacy of 30 grandchildren and 45 great-grandchildren.
His political aspirations ignited in the 1960s as he actively promoted indigenous causes and supported decolonization through the Warbete political group in East New Britain. His activism gained momentum, leading to his election to the first East New Britain Provincial Assembly in 1977, where he represented the Raluana local level government.
The passing of Patuana Ereman Vin ToBaining marks the end of an era for East New Britain, and the community remembers him as a dedicated public servant and a champion for the rights and aspirations of his people. His contributions to the province's political landscape will not be forgotten.
The body of the late ToBaining is currently placed at the Port Moresby funeral home, where it will remain until being repatriated to Kokopo this Friday. Upon arrival, it will lay in state, allowing family, friends, and community members to pay their respects before the casket is officially handed back to his clan.
A funeral service for ToBaining will be held at the Bitapetep United Church on Sunday, followed by his burial at his family tomb in Malapau. This gathering is expected to bring together many who were touched by his leadership and dedication to the community, as they honor his memory and legacy."
Sawang highlights importance of women in development,11/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3537,"In the PNG labor market, workforce participation rate for women is 50.6 percent compared to 53.1 percent for men.
However, they face a much larger gap in formal employment, where only 25 percent of the workforce are women.
Additionally, there is an average earnings gap of 13.7 percent between men and women, which is both unjust and economically counterproductive, says the Labor Minister and Member for Raicoast, Kessy Sawang.
She added that studies suggest that if women participated equally in the labor market, the national income could be 20 percent higher.
“With Papua New Guinea’s real national income estimated at K75.7 billion in 2025, this means we are forgoing an additional K15 billion due to gender disparities. “
“This is not just a call for fairness, it is a call for national prosperity. As part of my ministerial duties, I will be advocating for labor law amendments to eliminate workplace discrimination and enhance opportunities for women in business enterprises,” Sawang stated.
Sawang shared these data during the Divine Word Graduation in Madang last week Friday, 07 March 2025 as Papua New Guinea joined the rest of the world to observe and celebrate International Women’s Day.
Minister Sawang highlighted that the issue of gender equality ‘demands attention’, adding that the graduation was timely to reflect on the state of gender representation in the country.
While progress has been made, she said there is still a long way to go. Taking female representation at the National Parliament as an example, where there are only three women representatives among 118 members, she said this represents just 2.5 per cent despite women making up 47.9% of population.
Sawang concluded saying, “Gender equality is not just a woman’s issue; it is everybody’s business. Men must be active allies in creating an equitable society."

Manning provided this assurance after the Counter-Terrorism Joint Security Task Force (CTJSTF) had a meeting and set in place initial plans to combat current terrorist threats that present against the people of Papua New Guinea and overall national security.
At the first CTJSTF Meeting on the weekend in Port Moresby, the Task Force leadership headed by Police Commissioner, David Manning, and senior RPNGC and PNGDF, articulated operational requirements for the coming year.
“The creation of the JSTF, under the Counter-Terrorism Act, gives security forces stronger legislated authority to take down the criminals that terrorise, kidnap, rape and kill in our communities,” Commissioner Manning said.
“Terrorist acts are hurting our people and the Counter-Terrorism JSTF is tasked with assessing and planning counter-terrorist operations to apprehend the people who commit these atrocities. “The first JSTF meeting reviewed the legislative framework, considered current threat assessments, and examined immediate upskilling necessary to achieve proactive operational outcomes to stop terrorist activities.
“While details of what we agreed and the plans that are now in motion remain are classified for obvious security reasons, the people of our country can rest assured that they will be safer as these operations take place.
“Terrorists will be identified, located and arrested. The formation of tactical, intelligence and technical elements under the command of the JSTF will ensure that our operations are intelligence lead and conducted with surgical precision.”
The CTJSTF Executive is comprised of five members, with Commissioner Manning as Commander, a deputy from the RPNGC and the PNGDF, and three other senior uniformed personnel.
“Working together, supported through the authority provided by the Counter-Terrorism Act, we will turn the tide against those who terrorise communities and commit acts of terror.
“I thank the Marape-Rosso Government for its confidence in strengthening the laws of the Nation so that security forces can effectively deploy to remove terrorists from our streets.”"
Combating GBV in the workplace,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3531,"Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed a new partnership with the PNG Trade Union Congress (PNGTUC) in a collaborative effort to combat workplace harassment and gender-based violence (GBV).
The initiative aims to introduce stronger policies, advocacy programmes, and legal frameworks to protect women and girls in the workforce and beyond.
At a high-level meeting, PNGTUC General Secretary Clemence Kanau highlighted the critical role of trade unions in addressing GBV and workplace harassment, stating that this issue has never been formally tackled in employment contracts before.
“GBV is a serious problem. As unions, we have fought for workers’ rights for many years, but this is one issue that has never been properly addressed in our workplaces,” Kanau said.
“We want to collaborate with the Employers’ Federation and other stakeholders to develop a policy that will make workplace harassment a dismissible offence. This is something new, and we are committed to making it work.”
Kanau further outlined PNGTUC’s nationwide approach, which includes advocacy in schools, workplaces, and rural communities to educate young boys and girls about the importance of respect, safeguarding women, and rejecting violence.
“We must train boys and girls in classrooms so they understand why violence is wrong and learn to protect their sisters and mothers,” he added.
“This will not only empower women but also create a generation of men who stand against violence.”
Prime Minister Marape commended PNGTUC’s initiative and agreed that legal amendments may be necessary to incorporate anti-harassment and anti-violence clauses into employment contracts.
“This is a powerful and necessary step,” Marape said.
“We already have workplace policies that address harassment, but they are often confined to specific organisations. It’s time to expand these protections across all sectors and make them a national standard.”
The Prime Minister reiterated that combating GBV is not just about workplace policies—it starts in the home.
He noted that abusive behaviour, whether by men or women, must be addressed at its root cause to create a society where violence is unacceptable in every form.
“Leadership starts in the home. If a person is found to be abusive—whether it’s a man towards a woman or vice versa—there must be consequences. We must change our national mindset,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
Kanau also emphasised the importance of engaging international organisations, diplomatic missions, and development partners in this effort. PNGTUC plans to work closely with the United Nations, employers’ groups, and civil society organisations to ensure this initiative is well-resourced and effectively implemented.
“Unions have been fighting for workers’ rights for years, but often governments do not listen to us,” Kanau said.
“However, because of our democratic foundation, unions remain a critical voice in society. This collaboration is our first major step towards institutionalizing protections against workplace harassment and GBV.”
PNGTUC’s strategy includes:
-	Developing curriculum-based advocacy programmes in schools to educate young people about gender equality and violence prevention.
-	Strengthening link with rural communities to ensure that anti-violence messages reach all Papua New Guineans, not just those in urban centres.
-	Incorporating GBV protections into labour laws and workplace policies to ensure victims are protected and offenders are held accountable.
As part of PNG’s 50th anniversary of independence commemorations, the Prime Minister emphasised that addressing GBV and workplace harassment must be a key part of the country’s long-term development goals.
“This issue is not just about workplace policies—it is about creating a safer, more respectful society.
“As we reflect on our nation’s journey over the past 50 years, let us make a commitment to ensuring that our next 50 years are defined by equality, justice, and respect for all.”
The government, in collaboration with PNGTUC, will work towards legislative changes, workplace reforms, and national awareness campaigns to ensure that violence and harassment in any form are no longer tolerated in Papua New Guinea."
Cocoa Board focuses on expansion,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3528,"The Cocoa Board presented an ambitious 2025 strategy, focusing on expanding production, improving quality control, and enhancing export opportunities.
A key initiative in 2025 will be establishing a regional hub for cocoa development in Jiwaka Province.
""For the first time, we are introducing a large-scale cocoa development project in the Highlands,” Chief executive officer for Cocoa Board, Jesse Anjen announced.
""We have signed a MoA with the Jiwaka Provincial Government to establish a seed garden, a clonal budwood garden, and a regional cocoa distribution centre.”
This project aims to:
-	Increase cocoa cultivation in the Highlands region.
-	Provide improved planting materials to farmers.
-	Develop nurseries in key Highland provinces like Simbu, Eastern Highlands, and Western Highlands.
The Cocoa Board also plans to shift the industry towards more local processing and value addition.
“Instead of just exporting raw beans, we must invest in downstream processing to produce cocoa liquor, butter, and premium chocolate products locally,” Anjen stressed.
He said more funding will be sought to establish processing facilities that support local cocoa-based industries and public-private partnership is encouraged to build chocolate and confectionery processing plants.
Anjen said PNG will continue to expand its presence in global fine-flavour cocoa markets.
“Our goal is to increase PNG’s market share in the premium cocoa sector, particularly in Europe and North America.
“We will work with international partners to promote PNG cocoa in high-end chocolate industries.""
Therefore, Anjen said the Cocoa Board is requesting K20 million in funding under the Development Investment Programme (DIP) for 2025 to support its expansion plans.
“Government support is critical to helping our cocoa farmers thrive. We need more investments in research, extension services, and value chain development.”
""We are building a sustainable cocoa industry that benefits both farmers and the national economy. “With the right investments, infrastructure, and policy support, PNG can become one of the world’s leading producers of fine flavour cocoa,” Anjen said.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister James Marape acknowledged the Cocoa Board’s impressive progress and ambitious vision for the industry.
“Cocoa is a key revenue earner for Papua New Guinea, and we must invest in its future.
“The government will support efforts to expand cocoa farming into new regions, build better processing industries, and improve market access for farmers.”
He commended cocoa farmers and industry leaders for their resilience and commitment, urging more collaboration between government agencies and the private sector to drive growth.
With a clear roadmap for 2025 and beyond, the Cocoa Board of PNG is determined to expand production, improve quality, and enhance value addition."
New ablution for Butibam primary,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3527,"It has been years since Butibam Primary School saw a new building in the schoolgrounds at Bumbu.
Despite being located in Lae City, the school has termite-ridden buildings, no proper teachers’ resources and a lack of student learning materials. Even the blackboards in some of the classrooms have been eaten by termites.
School is suspended when it rains, while students are sent out of the classroom on windy days, in case the double-storey building comes crashing down.
The Butibam Pipeline Landowners Association came to the students' aid with the construction of a K350,000 ablution facility that was officially opened on Friday, March 7th.
The association, which is one of six impact landowner groups of the Wafi-Golpu project, has prioritised education and health using the infrastructure development grant from the State.
“We’ve focused on education institutions within the catchment areas,” outlined the chairman of the Butibam Pipeline Landowners Association, Peter Kesu-Sayama.
“So, Busu Secondary School, Amba Demonstration Primary School, Butibam Primary School, we’ve got Butibam elementary inside the village; we’ve allocated funding for infrastructure development.
“Busu, we’ve given them a bus with a total donation worth K200,000. Amba Demonstration we’ve built the same ablution facility for K350,000. Butibam elementary, we’ve allocated K200,000 to rebuild a rundown classroom.
“We’re also looking at the health sector within the community. We feel there’s a need for an aid-post in the village so we’ve put some money aside to construct a facility as well as look at the procurement of medication.”
After tax, the landowner association was left with an IDG value of K2.7 million from the gross value of K3 million.
Head teacher of Butibam primary, John Jigembe, said the school is looking forward to celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and the project was timely.
He said the primary school has been unable to maintain its infrastructure because the Government Tuition Fee Subsidy is insufficient. Furthermore, since he started in 2017, he attributed the school’s neglect to the lack of school fee payments by parents."
Strategy for street children launched,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3526,"The National Office for Child and Family Services (NOCFS) launched the National Street Children Response Strategy, a toll-free child protection hotline, and other key interventions aimed at addressing the growing concerns surrounding street children and child welfare in the country last Friday.
Minister for Youth, Religion, and Community Development, Jason Peter, alongside Secretary Jerry Ubase and heads of ministerial agencies, launched the National Street Children Identification and Response Program, National Child Protection in Emergency Response Strategy, National Street Children Report, Corporate Plan 2025-2027, Annual Operation Plan 2025, and the Child Protection Toll-Free Emergency Service Hotline Number – 1800234.
Minister Peter commended the Acting Director of NOCFS, Jerry Wap, for his leadership in taking the necessary steps to address child protection concerns.
“This is a milestone achievement for the Marape-Rosso government in safeguarding the safety and welfare of our children.
“The government through the NOCFS is working hard to tackle issues affecting street children and child welfare. But every time, parents and guardians must take responsibility. Children are not just our future; they are our present, given by God. We must take good care of them,” Minister Peter said.
He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to working with provincial and district authorities to decentralize child protection services starting from the National Capital District.
In his opening remarks, Wap acknowledged the minister, agency heads, development partners, NGOs, and other attendees. He delivered an emotional tribute to the late Simon Yanis, the former director who played a key role in establishing NOCFS.
“Today, we launch the achievements made during my three-month tenure as Acting Director. For too long, children have suffered from abuse, neglect, and exploitation. We cannot continue to ignore these issues.”
“Our theme is ‘Change a Generation, Shape the Future.’ We will start by identifying street children, collecting data, and integrating them back into their families.”
“NOCFS, in partnership with stakeholders, would begin identifying and processing street children in the National Capital District (NCD) from March 10, 2025, before expanding to other urban areas.
“We have no time to wait. Our hotline is now active to respond to street children and all child protection issues nationwide,” Wap said.
Department for Community Development and Religion Secretary, Jerry Ubase, provided insights into the governance structure of NOCFS, highlighting its alignment with the Lukautim Pikinini Act.
“The Council reflects a collaborative commitment to addressing child welfare issues. I thank development partners like UNICEF, Save the Children, government agencies, NGOs, and churches for their efforts,” Ubase said.
UNICEF Chief Child Protection Officer, Paula Vargas, praised the initiative, citing alarming global statistics.
“Eighty percent of children worldwide experience or witness violence. PNG’s commitment today is a step towards ending violence against children and we look forward to continuous partnership.”
The event concluded with a demonstration of the Hotline Number 1800234, which will be used to report and process cases of street children. The initiative will start in NCD this week and expand to other provinces."

SDP launches Morehead Health Centre,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3524,"The newly upgraded Morehead Health Centre in South Fly District, Western Province opened recently and is ready to provide vital health services to rural communities.
Morehead is one of the most remote communities in Western and in the country, with the hospital providing essential health services for over 30,000 people within the Morehead catchment area.
Over one thousand people including government and development partners gathered to witness the official opening of the SDP-funded newly upgraded Morehead Health.
The opening of the Morehead Health Centre reflects the vision of SDP’s Gutpela Community Strategy 2025-2030 to anchor its efforts and priorities in Western Province complementing the efforts of the local government and other key stakeholders.
In her address to the Morehead people, SDP Board Director Dame Meg Taylor expressed her gratitude to those who came to celebrate the occasion, including Minister for Health Elias Kapavore.
The health centre which was approved for construction in 2022, is a testament to the Public-Private Partnership between SDP and the Western Provincial Health Authority (WPHA).
“It has taken two and half years, 15 ship voyages, and 121 employees to complete this health facility at a total cost of over K52 million,” Dame Meg said.
The health centre boasts a suite of modern facilities, including a labor ward and maternity services, general inpatient care, laboratory services, a pharmacy, a central sterile services department, dental care and an operating theatre for minor surgeries.
As well as improving the range of healthcare services available to the Morehead community, the facility will also reduce referrals to Daru, ensuring more accessible treatment for the people.
Minister Kapavore, in his keynote address, applauded the effort of SDP, and stated that the facility was aligned with the government’s health vision of “all citizens having the fundamental right to accessible healthcare wherever they are”.
The Minister also stated his commitment to support SDP’s request to upgrade the facility to Level 4
accreditation elevating it to district hospital status. The centre is staffed with two doctors, two Health Extension Officers, and twenty medical and support staff. However, the Level 4 certification will mean further support from the government in allocating more health workers and doctors to the hospital.
South Fly MP and Minister for Livestock, Sekie Agisa was grateful for SDP’s partnership, voicing his confidence that the facility and its staff will be protected.
“It is our privilege to take ownership of this property”, he said, responding to Dame Meg’s comments about safeguarding the centre for future generations.
SDP’s health program is focused on strengthening drug supply chains, essential medical equipment, and health worker capacity through a new Nursing School in Balimo. SDP’s preventative health intervention employs health workers on 12 patrol teams serving 74 rural river and airstrip communities and reaching over 78,000 people across all four districts of Western Province.
Meantime, Western Province Governor, Taboi Awi Yoto recognised SDP as a key development partner, acknowledging its new strategy of investing in the people of Western Province."
ENB youths graduate with Commercial Fishing Operation Certificates,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3523,"Six young women are among 35 trainees in East New Britain who recently graduated with certificates in Commercial Fishing Operations Level One (CFO1).
Provincial Division of Fisheries and Marine Resources acting advisor, Enoch Pabon when speaking during the graduation at Rabaul Waterfront recently said the prerequisite for the CFO1 training follows an established MOA with the ENB Government and National Fisheries Authority (NFA) for fisheries management and training development in the province, and to pave way for formal employment.
The 6-week training held at Rabaul Waterfront in Rabaul town was facilitated by the National Fisheries College (NFC) for students from Woolnough, Milamila and Namatanai Vocational Schools. This is the second batch of students in ENB to graduate from this collaborative arrangement.
Mr Pabon said the CF01 is a competent course targeting trainees to seek employment on board fishing vessels and merchant ships either working as seafarers or deck hands and eventually make their way up to be captains or work in the engine room as motorman or chief engineers.
The CFO1 training packages include Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), first aid, seafarer’s handbook and fishing on board NFC MV Pokajam.
Team leader for NFC’s Commercial Fishing Operation Program, Captain Jerry Bagat highlighted similar trainings at NFC and ENB has seen more than 95 percent of students now working on vessels.
“Many females that underwent the CFO1 training are now working on vessels. This current batch is privileged to have 6 female trainees,” Cpt Bagat said.
“This field is dominated by males and I encourage our young women, if you want to become sea women, you must speak the same language as your male counterparts. To become a captain or a chief engineer is not impossible.”
According to the Provincial Division of Fisheries and Marine Resources, they will continue this partnership through the MOA to build capacity as ENB prepares to deliver fisheries investments projects such as the Rabaul Tuna Terminal, Rural/district jetties and onshore facility development that will ultimately create job opportunities."
Riverine communities call for CEPA’s interventions,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3518,"The Porgera Riverine Landowners have again called on the government and the Environment & Conservation Protection Authority (CEPA) to honor its commitment made to the Porgera Riverine Communities during the transfer of the environment permit.
The government of PNG and the CEPA are facing mounting criticism for their failure to conduct an environmental audit for the riverine communities adversely affected by the discharge of mine waste into the Porgera River.
According to a local leader representing the riverine communities and chairman of the Porgera River Alluvial Miners Association, Peter Papo, this negligence has been a source of ongoing concern, particularly in light of the controversial environmental permit issued in 1988, which was granted without a compensation agreement, and the recent transfer of this permit from Barrick to NPL without even conducting an Environmental audit to verify and assess complains raised by the affected communities.
Mr Papo said “During the transfer process, CEPA MD acknowledged and admitted past mistakes and committed to conducting an environmental audit before the recommencement of mining operations but, this promise now appears to be another instance of empty assurances, further exacerbating the distress of affected communities”
“We have raised environmental concerns since 1989 when the Porgera mine first began discharging waste into the river. The people of Lower Porgera, as well as the river communities, rely on this river for their survival, including the practice of alluvial mining. The government must not continue to ignore the plight of the river people”
“For over three decades, CEPA and the government of PNG have neglected the needs and rights of the Porgera River people, failing to conduct a comprehensive environmental audit despite repeated requests from affected communities,” Mr Papo emphasized.
He said “Three different Chief Secretaries to the government have issued explicit directives for CEPA to prioritize this audit, yet the agency continues to let down the landowners and communities that depend on the river.”
Considering these ongoing issues, Mr Papo is appealing to CEPA to urgently fulfill its commitment and conduct an environmental audit without further delay.
The health and livelihoods of the Porgera Riverine communities hang in the balance, and the government must take immediate action to address these critical environmental concerns.
“We call upon CEPA to act decisively and transparently to restore trust and ensure the well-being of the communities that have suffered for far too long.”"
Female police officers commended,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3517,"The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary NCD Command joined hands with the rest of the world to celebrate International Women's Day on Friday, March 7th.
This year, the command changed its location to host the event at Gerehu Police Station due to the many deaths involving women that are occurring in the Gerehu area.
Under the theme Accelerate Action for gender equality, the celebration headed by the PNG-Australia Policing Partnership (APP) brought together women of the force, both uniform and non-uniform, to remember and value their contribution to the police force.
The event was witnessed by NCD/Central Commander Benjamin Turi and representatives of the APP.
According to Turi, a proactive approach must be taken to address issues affecting women not just on special occasions but daily.
Turi said women in the police force have contributed enormously to the growth of the force over the years and have continued to do so despite facing challenges with their male counterparts or facing violence at home.
“Their efforts are a testimony to the positions they are holding in the force, such as the FSVU directorate and recent promotion of two female officers who are now second in charge of Boroko and Waigani Police Station,” said Turi.
He encouraged all female officers to work hard and excel in whatever role they hold in the force and not be discouraged by their male counterparts.
The ACP further urged male officers to respect female officers and work collaboratively with them to serve the community in the law and justice sector."

Reflecting on the significance of this global occasion, Prime Minister Marape emphasised that respect for women is the foundation of a strong and progressive society.
He reminded the nation that Papua New Guinea’s national anthem calls for ""all arise, sons of this land,"" and stated that now, more than ever, men must rise to defend, love, and protect the women of this country.
“It is our duty as men to look after our women, our girls, our mothers, and our sisters,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Leadership begins in the home, and the strength of our nation is measured by how we treat our women.”
Citing the biblical story of Adam and Eve, Prime Minister Marape underscored that women are equal partners in the home, workplace, and national development. He reiterated that men and women are one, and true progress can only be achieved when women are respected, valued, and empowered.
“As Papua New Guinea stands at the threshold of its 50th anniversary of independence, I call on all men to reflect on their role in ensuring that women are safe, supported, and given equal opportunities to contribute to our country’s growth,” he said.
Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed his government's commitment to gender equality and women’s empowerment, stressing that without fundamental respect for women, all other efforts for national
development would be meaningless.
“Women are the foundation of our society-they give birth to our population, they nurture, they lead, and they contribute immensely to our communities. We must ensure that our country is one where women can thrive without fear or discrimination,” he added.

"Claribel Waide, championing education equality",07/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3501,"As the world marks International Women’s Day on March 8, 2025, PNG Partnerships for Improving Education (PNG PIE) celebrates the remarkable journey of Claribel Waide, a dedicated advocate for Gender Equity and Social Inclusion (GESI) in Papua New Guinea’s education sector.
Hailing from Oro and Morobe Provinces, Claribel’s educational journey began at Okapa Community School, where her father was a teacher. She later attended Kafetina Community School before completing Grade 10 at Henganofi High School.
Inspired by her father, she pursued teacher training at Balob Teacher’s College in Morobe Province. However, during her second year, tragedy struck-her father passed away.
“As the eldest, I was devastated. I wanted to quit, but I remembered his words: ‘Study hard, secure a job, and look after your siblings,’” she recalled.
Determined to honor his wishes, Claribel persevered. After graduating, she returned to Oro and taught for over eight years, financially supporting her four younger siblings through university.
Inspired by their success, she pursued higher education, graduating from the University of Papua New Guinea with a degrees in Arts (Education) and Business Management (Public Policy Management).
With her qualifications, Claribel secured a role in the National Department of Education’s Human Resources Division as a GESI Officer. She spearheaded training, advocacy, and policy integration to mainstream gender equity across the education system.
Her efforts culminated in the launch of the GESI in Schools Policy at the Teachers Expo in September 2024, officiated by Pat Conroy, Kinoka Hotune Feo, and Lucas Dekena.
“I feel a sense of satisfaction, as it was a long and challenging journey,” Claribel said, acknowledging the support of colleagues and the Australian Government’s Partnerships for Improving Education program.
Claribel’s work focuses on breaking barriers for marginalised groups, including girls, children with disabilities, and students from remote areas. She conducts training workshops for teachers and community leaders, ensuring culturally inclusive and gender-sensitive teaching approaches.
Additionally, she supports research and data collection to inform policy decisions and track progress towards inclusive education goals.
Excited about the policy’s impact, Claribel believes it will promote accountability among stakeholders, ensuring all children-especially girls and those with disabilities-attend school and complete their education.
“This policy will hold everyone accountable for supporting children’s education,” she said.
As we observe International Women’s Day under the theme “For All Women and Girls: Rights, Equality, and Empowerment,” let us celebrate Claribel’s contributions and allow her story to inspire future generations."

EU provides grants support women’s empowerment,07/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3496,"The United Nation’s campaign around International Women’s Day this year, emphasizes the need to Accelerate Action to achieve gender equality. The theme, “For ALL women and girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment” underlines the increased momentum and urgency in addressing the systemic barriers and biases that women face, both in personal and professional spheres.
Globally, significant progress has been made towards achieving gender equality and women and girl’s empowerment. Despite the progress, women and girls’ rights continue to be violated around the world including in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
To address these ongoing challenges, the European Union (EU) has developed the Roadmap for Women's Rights, a strategic plan focused on advancing gender equality by combating gender-based violence, protecting women’s and girls’ rights, and ensuring equal opportunities in all areas of society. This is reflected in the EU’s targeted support, which provides funding exclusively to PNG Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) working to promote and protect human rights.
The EU sees CSOs as crucial for human rights, democracy, and stability, helping to improve livelihoods, support small producers and women, and shape policies that reduce inequalities. CSOs promote accountability, human rights, and transparency by providing free information and monitoring governance, corruption, and policy impact.
In 2024, the EU Delegation launched a Call for Proposals focused on 'Women’s Economic Empowerment and Leadership,' aiming to remove barriers to market access, investment, and business development for women, including marginalized groups, youth, and those with disabilities. The initiative promotes inclusive economic opportunities and supports the transition from informal to small or medium-sized businesses.
Today, the EU Delegation signed two new contracts supporting women’s economic empowerment in PNG, while commemorating International Women’s Day 2025. These two projects will be implemented by World Vision PNG and the Specialty Coffee Association of PNG.
World Vision will receive a 3.5 million kina (EUR 818,750) grant project to support 150 women entrepreneurs in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville. This project called, “Sapotim Strongpla Meri: Empowering AROB Women in Business” will support inclusive and equitable economic opportunities for women and youth by enhancing their knowledge, skills, capacity, and access to the market system in Central Bougainville.
The Specialty Coffee Association will receive a 3.5 million kina to enhance access to skills development, entrepreneurial training, financial services, and business leadership for women and girls in the specialty coffee value chain, including in the Highlands.
The ambassador thanked World Vision, the Specialty Coffee Association of PNG, the Government of Papua New Guinea, and civil society as a whole for their strong collaboration in advancing protect human rights, equal opportunity and gender equality.
The event was witnessed by Minister for Security and Bougainville Regional MP, Peter Tsiamalili Jr. and representatives from the civil society."
Collaborating to combat malnutrition,07/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3495,"The Child Nutrition and Social Protection (CNSP) Project Component Management Unit 2 (CMU 2) under the Department for Community Development and Religion signed a partnership contract with Save the Children on Tuesday 4 March, 2025.
The contract signing ceremony was witnessed by the Department’s Secretary, Jerry Ubase, CMU 2 team members, senior managers of the department, and Save the Children Country Director, Lisa Piper and her team.
CMU 2 Manager, Joseph Klapat, thanked Secretary Ubase and Deputy Karen Haive for their leadership in driving the rollout of this nutrition-sensitive project.
“It has taken extensive negotiations, but we are finally here to sign this agreement and formalize our partnership with a key organization that will help us move this project forward. We are very pleased to work with Save the Children,” said Klapat.
“Last year, we registered 1,760 beneficiaries (pregnant mothers and children under 2 years) across 11 wards in the four pilot provinces - East New Britain, Madang, Simbu, and Western, where a total of K115,530 in Child Nutrition Grant payments were disbursed.
“With this signing, we now look forward to expanding the scope of the project to new provinces and districts,” Klapat said.
Ubase commended Klapat and his team for their commitment to supporting children and mothers through the Child Grant initiative and also thanked Save the Children's Country Director, Lisa Piper, and her team for finalizing the partnership.
“Child malnutrition remained a challenge in PNG since independence, and the government has struggled to address it.
“With the National Social Protection Policy 2022-2030 now endorsed by the National Executive Council and set to be launched this month, we have a strategic framework to reduce stunting and improve the lives of marginalized and vulnerable people.
“With Save the Children on board, I believe the scope of the partnership would help expand the CNSP project’s impact in reducing child stunting in PNG,” Ubase said.
Piper thanked the CMU 2 Project team and the Secretary for the partnership, expressing her commitment to supporting efforts to reduce child malnutrition and stunting in the country."
ENB works to address crime,07/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3494,"A meeting was held this week in East New Britain to address its persistent law and order issues.
It was facilitated by the East New Britain Provincial Member, Michael Marum, and ENB Provincial Administrator, Levi Mano, to discuss the government’s strategies.
In attendance were also Kokopo MP, Ereman Tobaining Jnr, Assistant Commissioner of Police – New Guinea Islands, Naua Vanuavaru, Kerevat Correctional Services Commander, Superintendent John Poris, and provincial church representative, Pastor Anthony Kivung.
Provincial Administrator Levi Mano reiterated the three main strategies by the provincial government to look at law and order in the short, medium and long term basis.
He said the immediate response on law and order obviously lies with the responsible government agency on the ground, which is the disciplinary forces, who respond on a daily basis to law and order issues.
“The short term strategy is how we assist the disciplinary forces. We have a specific program where we assist the police department with resources, as in fuel, logistics and also rations. But the execution part of it belongs to the police department, the courts and then the Correctional Services,” he stated.
He said apart from the support to the police department, the districts are conducting awareness in schools to target juveniles, especially in Rabaul district, with Kokopo district to follow suit.
The medium term strategy depends on the type of programs and their duration, and one of them is the rollout of training programs through the Division of Community Development.
“In 2024, we signed eight Service Level Agreements with service providers to engage them to conduct life skills training for youths in the wards. Those training needs were submitted by the LLGs in the province. And one of those service providers has been engaged to collect data on Grade 12 school leavers, from 2022 up to last year,” Mano added.
A report on those service providers is expected by the end of this month (March), to see how they have fared in the provision of the training, and that report will be further provided to the provincial government.
Mano said this year, they are engaging the Tertiary Students Christian Fellowship (TSCF) to do awareness among students in educational institutions.
Long term strategies are captured in the ENB 10-year Strategic Development Plan (2023 - 2033), under sectors such as land mobilisation, agriculture and livestock, tourism and fisheries, apart from infrastructure, commerce via SME support and education through reforms.
In this year’s budget, the family and community empowerment program, which comprises of funded micro-programs for family units, has been progressed under the law and justice sector.
Also under the government’s long term measures are church run programs, and the establishment of four police posts targeting hot spot areas for criminals, especially at the Gelagela resettlement, and then around the Nangananga-Vunamurmur area in Kokopo District, Pere at Melkoi LLG in Pomio District, and along the north coast road between Gazelle and Rabaul districts.
The province will also have a police reservists program running this year, co-funded by the provincial government and the Police Department.
Mano said the provincial government also recently endorsed 36 by-laws to be executed by the LLGs.
“These by-laws give the power and authority to the LLGs and the wards to create a law in their locality to address and maintain good peace and order.
“Those bylaws would be executed by the LLG, Ward Development Committees and the village courts, but awareness would be done by the districts on how to execute them, from issuing a order to police then to CS.”
The PA iterated that law and order is a shared responsibility, and is not entirely the provincial government’s job. Hence, decisions made are implemented by the public service into communities as the recipients, who also contribute to the law and order issues.
“I urge the people of ENB to help the provincial government and the administration execute these strategies, so that we all can say that we have worked together to ensure we have a peaceful community.”"
Fatal Pindiu accident claims three,07/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3493,"A fatal vehicle accident at Pindiu, in Morobe’s Finschhafen district, has claimed three lives while 14 passengers have been admitted to the hospital.
The accident occurred when a hired open-back dark blue Landcruiser was transporting 17 passengers and food to a ‘haus krai’ in Onsesu village, in the Hube Local Level Government, on Wednesday, March 5th.
The vehicle already had 14 passengers – some who had travelled from Lae – when it left Gagidu at 2pm. At Yanzung village, three more passengers got on with garden food for the haus krai.
Gagidu Rural Police Station Commander, Inspector Dominic Livar, reported that the vehicle was traveling down a steep slope towards Mugi Bridge. As they approached the Garenggareng sharp turn, the driver applied the brake but the vehicle did not respond.
Instead, it started gaining momentum and drove over the edge.
“The vehicle tipped over, throwing off all its passengers.”
Due to the sheer drop – considering Pindiu is one of the mountainous areas of Finschhafen – a female nursing officer at the Braun Memorial District Hospital, a 13-year-old Grade 4 student and his mother reportedly died on impact.
Fourteen other passengers were taken to Braun with severe injuries, while the driver had escaped, with Inspector Livar saying he will be picked up for questioning.
The Finschhafen police station commander has recommended that a traffic officer from the Morobe Provincial Police Headquarters be involved in the investigation. He said the accident has revealed that the vehicle has no ownership documentation, no registration and insurance, roadworthiness is questionable and no safety documents."
Raicoast commits to develop center,07/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3492,"The Rai Coast District Development Authority (DDA) this week officially signed a contract with the Department for Community Development and Religion for the construction of a District Community Development Centre (DCDC).
Following the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 2024, the contract was signed by Minister for Labour and Employment and Rai Coast MP Kessy Sawang; Youth, Religion, and Community Development Minister, Jason Peter; Department Secretary, Jerry Ubase; Rai Coast District CEO, Hans Tanguri; and Linguan & CO Limited Managing Director, Yunlin Guan.
Minister Peter thanked Minister Sawang and her team for supporting the project, which aims to serve vulnerable groups, including women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.
“This project aligns with the government’s broader goal to strengthen services in rural areas through the ‘Going Rural Initiative.’ We are focusing on rural development and aim to build more such centers across the country,” Minister Peter said.
Secretary Ubase highlighted the importance of bringing government services closer to the people.
“Similar to other DCDCs, the new two-story facility will feature over 50 workstations on the upper floor, with conference facilities on the ground floor. The office spaces will be allocated to community development officers, various ministerial agencies, government departments, and partner organizations.
“We will also build a transit lodge to provide a safe house for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) and sorcery-related violence. The facility will be securely fenced, with a standby generator and water storage tanks,” Ubase explained.
Minister Sawang acknowledged Minister Peter and Secretary Ubase for their leadership and support in establishing the DCDC project.
“Rai Coast has lacked a proper district office for over a decade, making service delivery challenging. This new building will help bridge this gap and establish a stronger government presence in the region,” she said.
She also urged the contractor and the department to complete the project by September 16, in time for the country’s 50th Golden Jubilee celebrations.
“I want to give this building as a 50-year Jubilee gift to the people of Rai Coast. Now that the department and contractor are here, we must complete it before September 16 so our people can see that the government cares,” she added.
Once the district funding component is paid, the department will counter-fund the project and give the green light for the contractor to begin mobilization and construction."
DPLGA to station officers in provinces,07/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3491,"The Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs (DPLGA) is working on a new structure to strengthen the social contract between the State and the people through the sub-national governments.
Secretary Philip Leo said an officer each will be reassigned from the headquarter to 20 provinces throughout the country under this new structure, once complete.
“These officers will be on the ground providing technical support and ensuring that systems are functioning as intended.
“Their responsibilities will include monitoring the regularity of LLG and provincial meetings and ensuring that leaders and public servants fulfil their obligations.
“Provincial governments, district development authorities and their business arms are reminded that they are legally required to report through the established channels.
“Transparent reporting and adherence to legal requirements are important to effectively deliver essential services to our people.
“My department will be closely monitoring compliance to ensure these requirements are met,” he said.
DPLGA is taking this approach to ensure the leaders and senior public servants at the subnational government level comply with section 187A of the Constitution, the Organic Law on the Provincial and Local Level Governments, District Development Authority Act, the City Authority Act and the Local Level Government Act that forms the framework of the sub-national governments.
Secretary Leo emphasized these changes when he convened the first meeting for Maip-Mulitaka LLG in Enga Province on February 27, 2025.
The Secretary expressed dissatisfaction that this was the first meeting conveyed following the 2019 – 2020 LLG elections, following reports and complaints from across the country of ‘substantial gap in governance and representation’ at the sub-national government level between the people and the State.
He said the failure of the Maip-Mulitaka LLG to conduct its regular meetings since then is a case in point of ‘systemic issue’ across the country that holds people at bay from the State.
He said it was equally disappointing to observe from these reports about the frequent absence of leaders and public servants from their designated locations.
“This prolonged neglect by the leaders of the third-tier governments, who are constitutionally entrusted with legislative duties, is an issue that can no longer be ignored,” he said.
He pointed out that sections 53-55 of the OLPLLG nullified by the Supreme Court does not impact on their mandate to hold all levels of governments accountable for their actions.
“They must operate within their legal framework.
“The Constitution and the enabling legislations are in place to promote good governance and we will ensure their proper implementation,” Secretary Leo stressed.
Meanwhile, he revealed that the department is reviewing provincial governments and LLG assemblies’ Standing Orders to further strengthen the governance mechanism.
He said this review aims at enhancing clarity and enforceability to ensure the sub-national governments function effectively in serving the people.
Stressing on the crucial role of the leaders and the public servants at the sub-national level in the welfare and development of the communities, the DPLGA secretary challenged them to step up to their responsibilities come the country’s 50th Independence Anniversary on September 16, 2025 and in the years to come."
Overcoming challenges: Lillian Gurina,07/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3489,"Starting out cleaning office spaces on minimum wage, to now overseeing a G4S fleet team of 56 staff and 48 vehicles, Fleet Coordinator for TotalEnergies, Lillian Gurina, is a brilliant example of how hard work truly pays off.
Having worked in Construction, Transportation and now Oil and Gas, Lillian is no stranger to being the only female in male-led teams. She is an all-rounder who constantly challenges herself and those around her to aspire for more, believing that there is no limit to how much one can learn.
“When it comes to my work, I apply this saying: you don’t wait for things to happen to react to them - you have to foresee, so when you are planning, you have to take those things into consideration,” she says.
Proud of her Koiari heritage, Lillian is the second youngest of five siblings, raised by her older sister after their dad passed away when she was younger.
Completing all of her schooling in Sogeri, she attended Sogeri Elementary and Primary School, Iarowari High School and continued on to Sogeri National High School for her Secondary School diploma.
She had attended College in East New Britian, studying building and architecture, but was unable to complete her course.
After keeping herself busy with baby sitting and side jobs, Lillian participated in a short course, to upgrade her knowledge on computer hardware and obtained a diploma in Information Technology (IT) in 2014.
“In 2015, there was a Construction company, NC Civil Works, building our road and they were looking for someone to clean their office and I was recommended for the job,” she shares.
“I worked as an office attendant for a month and then the Managing Director noticed I was capable of doing more so decided to try me out for an admin assistant position. I did that from September 2015 to April 2016 and then I became Project Admin, until I left in 2018,” she adds.
Through her project admin role, she grew comfortable learning more about the roles of everyone involved in construction and engineering because she had a hands-on involvement on all administrative related operations.
“In 2019 I joined China Railway Construction Engineering. I was the Project site Admin HR and the only national woman (at the time), out of a project team of 100+ men from Indonesia, China and Papua New Guinea that built the Able Computing Office complex,” she states.
Taking a break in 2020, she returned to NC Civil Works in 2021 to help out for a few months, feeling grateful to her former boss Nicholas Constantinou for helping her with her starting position and credits him for shaping her into the professional she is now.
“He is the reason why I am, where I am. We were trained tough – he was a very tough boss but I got used that leadership style and appreciate it because it prepared me to always be on top of things and plan ahead,” she says.
While she was back with NC Civil works, she applied for the position of Fleet Coordinator with TotalEnergies after noticing it on LinkedIn. Although she was asked to go in for an interview, she was not successful but did receive a favourable offer from Ela Motors, so joined in late 2021.
Working as a Fleet Support officer with Ela Motors for one year and credits her time at Ela Motors for learning more about vehicles in general and the processes in place for fleet customers, which has come in handy for her current role.
“It was challenging (at Ela Motors) because of the number of branches and customers but I enjoyed my time there, I learnt so much. I was part of the team that looked after fleet customers and then we also provided guidance to the service departments of the 16 branches,” she says.
Joining TotalEnergies in March 2023 as Fleet Admin, she was promoted to the position of Coordinator in October 2024, working closely and learning as much as she can from the Fleet Superintendent.
“My job is to make sure that the vehicles are safe, that the staff are transported to and from, the drivers are happy and to make sure that the people who help us by providing us drivers are paid,” she says.
“It has been interesting thus far, my time with TotalEnergies. This is my first Oil & Gas job, which is what enticed me to apply in the first place so I’m enjoying learning from all my colleagues,” she affirms.
Grateful for all of her experiences, she would like to believe that she has left an impact during her time within the different companies.
“I’m not an avid Church goer but the main thing is that I have faith in the Lord and in where he is leading me. Learn to accept failure and rejection and rely on God to lead you to where he needs you to be,” she says."
Illegal miner falls to death,07/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3487,"Police and security personnel discovered the body of a local this morning in the mine pit in Porgera, believed to be of an illegal miner who fell from the Air Vent bench 20,23, a fall of approximately 400+ meters and landed on the Pit floor.
It is believed that there was a stone-throwing fight in the pit by the different factions of illegal miners at the 5C bench over rights to fossil material.
The body was retrieved by members of the community and taken to Kulapi.
Mine operations remain undisturbed with the general situation in the pit reported quiet and normal."
Inspirational Women in Leadership: Jean-Marie Yalibu,07/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3486,"Overcoming quite a lot to be where she is today, Jean-Marie Yalibu’s story serves as an inspiration to those currently going through a difficult situation that the Lord always provides and sees you through.
“Growing up in a mission home, I never thought that I would experience some of the struggles I went through in my life, so I firmly believe that God provides always and that the best teacher is life,” she says smiling.
Born and raised in Eastern Highlands, the Southern Highlands native and single mum of two is the General Services Manager for TotalEnergies.
“I’m the youngest of four and the only girl; I have three older brothers. My parents were missionaries, so I was born and raised in mission compound run by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), where missionaries come from all over the world, live and dedicate their life to the local communities by educating, training and translating the Scripture. SIL is in the outback of Eastern Highlands,” she explains.
Having been educated for most of her formative years in the quaint little mission compound, she went on to complete her secondary school at Aiyura National High School in 2009 and then moved to Lae to pursue a Diploma in Civil Engineering at the National Polytechnic Institute of PNG.
Completing her course in 2012, she got her first job with Shorncliffe 1965 Limited shortly after graduating, as a Site Engineer.
“I had the choice of whether I wanted to work or continue with my studies, but I chose to work because of the situation I was in at the time. My first job as a Site Engineer was for routine and emergency road maintenance works on the Highlands Highway from Lae Main Wharf to Yung Creek,” she said.
“I was pregnant with my first born and it was tiring but fulfilling to be out on the highway, in the hot sun during those ‘Road Doctor’ days, she added smiling.
Leaving Shorncliffe after a year and a half, she joined Regional Engineering and Construction (REC) Ltd in 2014 as a Site Manager working full time on site, for the construction of classrooms at Balop Teacher’s Training College in Lae Morobe Province.
“During that time that I was with REC, I wanted to continue my studies, and my employer granted approval to take courses at the International Training Institute (ITI) Lae campus. So, I worked during the day and studied at night – I took night classes,” she said.
In 2016, she was hired as Special Projects Manager at the Pacific Adventist University (PAU). Relocating to Port Moresby, she was with PAU for four years as a newly single mum, following the birth of her baby, even managing to complete the course she had started in Lae at ITI and graduated with a Diploma in Business Management from the Port Moresby campus.
“I chose to focus on my career and it became the support that I needed during the difficult times – I had found a purpose and a way to block out all the negative. Even if things were falling apart in my personal life, I would always show up to work on time and dedicated myself 100% to my career,” she explains.
She eventually moved on from PAU and joined Brian Bell Group under the Property Division. She continued her passion for her studies and decided to get her degree. Accumulating all her entitled days off, she studied at Divine Word University and graduated with a Bachelor of Business Management.
Noticing an ad for her current position posted on her social network page and then recommended to her by friends, she felt compelled to apply.
“I was interested but hesitant at the same time because I did not have experience in the Oil and Gas industry. I was encouraged to apply nonetheless so I took it upon myself to do research on TotalEnergies globally and the type of work they were doing in PNG,” she says.
As part of a fully national team, led by a national female director, it is her job to ensure a safe and healthy working environment, overseeing all office related matters in terms of residential, commercial building, critical equipment and housekeeping for the Upstream Logistics site in Gulf, the office in Port Moresby and the logistics site out at AES.
“There’s a common respect of how far someone has worked to be where they are and so I appreciate that. Working for a big company such as TotalEnergies has really helped take me out of my comfort zone,” she attests.
She credits God for bringing her this far in life, her children as being a huge driving force, and her parents, to be better for them.
She shares a reminder that when you join an organisation, if you have the right attitude and are willing to learn, you will go far in life.
“My educational journey is not over yet; I am planning to pursue my master’s in management by God’s grace and timing. I am grateful to be in a conducive working environment; there are colleagues here that have extensive knowledge in their own profession with Oil & Gas and I am privileged to work with them,” she says.
“I have good support from my managers and the team around me, everyone is supportive, it excels me to want better for myself and the services I manage here at TotalEnergies,” she added."
Women in STEM: Hua Morea,07/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3485,"The only female in a technical, male led team, Geographical Information System (GIS) Officer at TotalEnergies, Hua Morea, is completely in her element.
“I never feel challenged or like I have to compete with the guys. There is so much respect, understanding and support within the team and everyone has different strengths and we all work together to build that up,” she says.
“That’s what contributes to my growth, both professionally and personally. From the beginning of my time here, I would say that I wasn’t as professionally equipped, but the team has helped me sharpen the edges, they have helped me improve/grow so much,” she adds.
The 29-year-old from Hanuabada, is the first of four siblings in a family of six. She began her early childhood learning in her village, then went on to the Institute of Christian Academy, before graduating from Marianville Secondary School in 2015.
“I was at Marianville and then the following year I moved to Lae to pursue my degree in GIS. It was a completely new experience for me, I’m a family girl, so it was my first time to really be exposed to a new environment and different way of life,” she reveals.
“All my decisions up until that point, were or had been essentially centred around that (my family) so when I was away, I had to learn to take care of myself for the first time,” she added.
She attests that, even though she had not seriously thought about what she wanted to be, she knew that she had a passion for geography after finishing from high school and saw that as her deciding factor when she was choosing a path for university.
“I would say that my education, from high school all the way to completing my bachelors, I did that for my family and I think I did well. Right after me, my cousin sister followed and that made me proud,” she said.
“I’d like to feel that what I did was more than just attain a degree, I was out there breaking barriers, building a pathway for the next generation of my family to be inspired to go to school, all the way to tertiary and maybe beyond,” she added.
After she graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) from the PNG University of Technology (UniTech), she had been hit with the stark reality of finding a job during the pandemic.
“Covid-19 was also happening, making it really hard to find work, but around the same time, there was a need for greater awareness on Covid, so I was paid to volunteer and raise awareness in the Motukoita villages,” she shares.
“We would go set up in the heart of the villages, in the public spaces and people would be invited to come and listen. It was a new experience and it was nice because it was in our language so I feel like the message was well communicated,” she added.
Following this she joined Darkon Consultancy firm as a GIS officer, working there for a few months, building up her professional capabilities before joining TotalEnergies initially as a GIS intern in 2021.
“The working environment here is great, being the only girl is not something I’m intimidated by. I believe, when you find your purpose in a team, you won’t let others diminish your value according to your gender; you know that your contribution matters,” she shares confidently.
She notes that her goals have changed since transitioning from an intern to GIS officer, as it is no longer just about job experience, she seeks to learn and contribute to her colleagues in any way that she can.
“I challenge myself on a daily or weekly basis, asking myself what I learn from this opportunity, in a company like this, with what is being offered to me at this point. How do I contribute in small ways, because over time, one person’s small contribution is going to leave a big impact,” she says.
“I have learnt so much, especially from the people I work with. This company has offered me opportunities, which I may have never been exposed to elsewhere, so I am and will always be grateful to TotalEnergies, because I get to take this knowledge with me,” she adds.
She views her role as a Sunday school teacher of over five years to children between the ages of 10 and 11 as a beautiful way of serving her community.
“It is also a challenging job because you’re not only a teacher to them, but you also become a role model, teaching them about life. I have to keep that in mind and try to apply it in all aspects of my life, even at work,” she says.
She advises that it’s okay not to have everything figured out at first or all at once, and to be pressured by external opinions, but that one should take time to sit with themselves and reflect on what’s really important in life to them.
“Do not take for granted the opportunities available to you, it will lead to what is meant for you. Take full advantage of all the opportunities, make use of everything, learn, grow, develop and be kind to everyone because you don’t know what they’re going through,” she says.
“God first in everything. Pray for it, pray through it and pray at it! Phil 4:13, I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength,” she affirms."
Rabaul private sector concerned,07/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3484,"The business community of Rabaul Town has expressed deep concerns over the escalating law and order issues that have recently plagued both the town and the wider province.
During a Rabaul Business Community meeting held on Tuesday, March 4th, at the Rabaul Hotel, business owners, together with provincial and district leaders, discussed ways to effectively address the issues.
Present at the meeting to receive the concerns and suggestions of the business houses was the East New Britain Provincial Member, Micheal Marum, acting Rabaul District Administrator, Freddy Lemeki, and Town Mayor, Changol Manuai. Also present was the ENB Senior Provincial Magistrate, Samuel Lavutul.
Rabaul Hotel owner, Susan McGrade, who hosted the meeting, said the business houses in Rabaul employ around five thousand to six thousand employees. She further said though they are assisting in terms of employment, their businesses and employees are also at risk.
Also speaking at the meeting was chairman of the Chinese community in Rabaul and representative of the Hongland Group of Companies, Tom Tong, who also voiced similar concerns.
“As an employer, we are struggling to keep our staff or have stable employees. Most of our workers leave out of fear. Though we provide good security, we are still at risk as we can only do so much,” Tong outlined.
Meantime, acting Rabaul District Administrator, Freddy Lemeki, said they are working with the provincial administration, provincial government, police, magisterial services, Correctional Services, churches and relevant stakeholders to address law and order issues.
Lemeki said a police reservist training is scheduled for the month of April, and added that this would assist in beefing up manpower, which is a major challenge for police in the province.
He said from this program, the reservists can be deployed to hotspots and do footbeats.
Lemeki also announced that an eviction exercise is planned for the coming months to evict illegal settlers in Rabaul Town."

An Australian Defence Force Mobile Training Team (MTT) is at Taurama Barracks, Port Moresby, where the PNGDF and ADF soldiers are developing their ability to work side by side.
Over the next three months, the ADF MTT will be supporting the PNGDF with foundational training to qualify new soldiers, sailors and aviators.

Major General Collingburn commenting on this visit said, “It’s wonderful to be back here in this beautiful country (PNG). I was last here in the middle of last year (2024) so its great to be back to visit our training team here.”
Underscoring the purpose of his visit, he said, “I command Australia’s 1st division so the training teams that we send over here are from my division.
“The training that’s occurring here today is foundation soldier training. So, what you’ll see is a section attack occurring out on the grass but really what our people are doing is enhancing the capability within the PNGDF and improving interoperability within our two forces.
“That’s the real focus.”
The Major General highlighted that ADF historically sends out three training teams every year. The ADF MTT that are facilitating the current training are the first team for the year. Each training duration is three months.
“We’ll send three training teams out throughout the course of this year. Our focus for this first Mobile Training Team will be very much on officer training and then as we progress throughout the year we’ll do more advanced training, including advanced combined arms training.”
Major General Collingburn used the opportunity to highlight Australia and PNG’s close and enduring defence partnership.
“It’s a natural partnership across the Australian Defence Force and the Papua New Guinean Defence Force – we have a shared history, we share a maritime border, we have shared customs and traditions, and we have really strong people-to-people links,” said Major General Collingburn.

He further highlighted the recent announcement made by Defence Minister Dr Billy Joseph and Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles on the shared commitment to negotiate a bilateral defence treaty, stating that this direction will take the partnership from interoperability to full integration that is based on strategic trust.
Inferring to the strategic trust between the two forces, he said, “Right now, within my third brigade in Townsville, the deputy commander of the third brigade is a Papua New Guinea Defence Force Officer, Colonel Bonnie Aruma. And I think that’s a very powerful demonstration of that strategic trust. We have a deputy commander of a fighting brigade who is a PNGDF officer.
He added, “Just yesterday I met with the CDF (Rear Admiral Philip Polewara) here and his Chief of Staff (Lieutenant Colonel Raphael Yapu), a classmate of mine from the Royal Military College Dunton, so it’s hard to imagine two closer defence forces working together.”
The demonstration between the ADF and PNGDF at Taurama Barracks presented a unique opportunity to witness how the capability and interoperability of the two defence forces has grown, and a demonstration of the strength of the defence partnership between the PNGDF and the ADF that has endured for more than 50 years.

Meantime, Major General Collingburn emphasized the significant efforts of the Australian Defence Force to ensuring full participation in its force from its citizens regardless of gender.
“We have a real focus on diversity across our army and across my division. The battalion that’s here at the moment, the first mobile training team is an armored infantry battalion and we have women serving in that armored infantry battalion so that’s a really good demonstration I think that there are no barriers for women serving in the Australian Defence Force.
“It’s a real focus for us to ensure that we have a really good diversity across the workforce,” said Major General Collingburn."
Late Constable Biape’s family aggrieved,06/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3479,"The family members of the late Constable Noah Biape are disappointed that they were not involved in the recent petition presentation hosted by the Police hierarchy and the members of Southern Highlands and Eastern Highlands on Tuesday, March 4th.
The grieving family, along with relatives, have been mourning in silence for seven weeks. They are now demanding an explanation for the perceived disregard shown by these leaders.
The family is particularly upset that their petition was not received alongside the one presented on Tuesday, which was the petition of late Constable Harry Gorano. They feel this sensitive issue was not handled with the respect and consideration it deserved.
Noah’s late father, who is the Koroba Kopiago Police Station Commander Sergeant Henry Biape described the situation as a significant insult to his son.
Sergeant Biape has dedicated 37 years of service to the police force. Combined with his late son's 10 years of service, the family has contributed an impressive 47 years to law enforcement. They believe this treatment is unworthy of their sacrifices and commitment.
Sgt. Henry Biape had previously called for peace and calm following the tragic incident, showing respect for the work of the police. However, the events of Tuesday, when the SHP, Eastern Highlands leaders, and police hierarchy met to receive the petition from the Eastern Highlands family, have deeply hurt the Biape family. They were not approached or consulted by the relevant leaders and authorities, which they see as a failure to address their grievances and concerns.
The family of the late Constable Noah Biape is now demanding answers from the SHP leaders, the Police Minister, and the Police Commissioner. They want to know why they were excluded from the joint media conference and petition presentation."
DPM called to take back PEA appointment powers,06/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3476,"The Papua New Guinea Teachers Association has called on the Department of Personnel Management to take back the power to appoint Provincial Education Advisors, a power they previously held.
PNGTA National President, Aita Sanangkepe said the appointment of these advisors was decentralized to the provincial level, leading to many appointments not made on merit.
According to Sanangkepe, the primary role of an Education Advisor is to fully manage the education of each province. They look at the appointment of teachers, teachers' leave fares, teachers' retirement issues, and other issues affecting teachers.
However, these issues seem to have increased in the recent past, indicating that the authority that is responsible for dealing with these issues is not doing its job.
That is why PGTA is now calling of the Department of Personnel management to take back the power to  appoint Provincial Education.
He said the association’s primary concern is the welfare of teachers, as quality education can only be achieved through the dedication and support of exemplary educators. Teachers' concerns must be addressed appropriately by the Provincial Education Boards and Education Advisors
The president urged the government to address these urgent matters to ensure a better quality of education for all Papua New Guineans."
BbP Opens new Learning Centre in Lae,06/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3472,"Buk bilong Pikinini (BbP) celebrated the grand opening of its new St. Steven Library Learning Centre (LLC) at 3 Mile in Lae yesterday, marking a significant step in advancing early childhood education and literacy in Papua New Guinea.
The centre, sponsored by Lae Biscuit Company through The Chow Foundation, aims to provide literacy, numeracy, digital learning, and nutritional literacy programs to children in Lae and surrounding areas.
Distinguished guests in attendance included John Chow, CEO of The Chow Foundation, Brenton Kanowski, Australian Consul-General in Lae, Keith Tangui, Morobe Provincial Education Adviso; and Anne-Sophie Hermann, Founder and Vice-Chair of BbP.
Ms. Hermann expressed deep gratitude, stating, ""This partnership highlights the private sector’s vital role in shaping young minds."" Similarly, Mr. Chow emphasised the collective responsibility of education, adding, ""This centre represents hope, opportunity, and progress.""
A highlight of the event was a traditional dance performance by the Parents Committee, followed by an official blessing of the centre. Former BbP students also shared inspiring testimonies on how the program positively impacted their education.
This new facility is a testament to public-private partnerships driving educational progress in PNG, ensuring children have access to quality learning resources."
A farmer’s quest to address malnutrition,06/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3471,"A poultry farmer in Kutubu is breeding egg-layer chickens as an alternate source of protein for the people there with the goal to improve nutrition and contribute to minimizing malnutrition in the district.
Alphonse Pani of Hedenia village in Kutubu, Southern Highlands Province tapped into this project  in his remote community after seeing the high prevalence of child malnutrition due to lack of balanced diets in a family unit everyday. He is hoping the production of eggs in the community can assist in addressing this issue as it can be accessed easily and at affordable prices as eggs are a good source of protein.
Alphonse started his chicken layer program in December last year, starting with 500 chickens. The chickens should be able to start laying at 17 weeks.
Alphonse plans to expand this project to include more chickens but has been faced with funding challenges. He explained his challenges on Monday saying raising chicken layers is expensive compared to broilers, highlighting the high cost of the chicks, the chicken feed, the time it takes for the chickens to mature and start laying eggs, and labour.
""Raising egg-layers is a different game. A box of 52 egg layer chicks from Niugini Tablebirds in Lae cost K1000. I arranged transport to bring the young chicks home to Kutubu safe by road,"" he said.
He bought a total of ten boxes of chicks for K10,000 and a total of 40 stock feed bags These stock feed bags comprise 15 bags of layer starter, 11 bags of grower and 14 bags of layer finisher.
But despite this cost, Alphonse says during the egg production phase, each chicken should be able to lay at least one egg per day. His target is to have 500 eggs per day by 500 chickens so in one week, he is looking to sell 3500 eggs and about 14,000 eggs in a month.
Alphonse is raising his chickens in a temporary shelter made of bush materials and intends to construct a permanent structure, but again funding remains a constraint. This project has cost him almost K20,000. He sourced this money from a small trade store he owns. Alphonse’s aim is to improve nutrition and create income earning opportunities for locals through the reselling of eggs."
NIP Assembly to elect caretaker governor,06/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3469,"With the passing of the late Governor of New Ireland Province, Sir Julius Chan, the main question now is, who will be the next Governor?
Upon Sir J’s passing, his Deputy, Sammy Missen, automatically took over as caretaker governor.
Pending a by-election date, yet to be set by the PNG Electoral Commission, the Provincial
Assembly will sit on the 26th of March and go ahead with the Election of an acting governor.
Per the advice from the secretary of the Department of Provincial & Local Level Government Affairs, Philip Leo, upon the passing of the late Provincial Governor, there is now effectively a vacancy in the seat of the provincial governor. This is pursuant to section 19(1)(e) of the Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments (OLPGLLG).
Section 21(1) reads: “(1) Subject to Subsection (3), if the Provincial Governor vacates his office in accordance with Section 19(1), or is dismissed from office in accordance with Section 20, the Provincial Assembly shall, from amongst the members of the Assembly who are Members of the Parliament, elect the Provincial Governor.”
However, section 19(1) (b) clarifies that if a member of Parliament is holding a Ministry, they are automatically disqualified from being eligible to be elected as Provincial Governor. In the event that they wish to be eligible to be elected, they will have to resign from their ministerial portfolios.
“If both of the Open MPs resign in time for the intended date to elect a Provincial Governor
on the floor of the Assembly, which is 26th March 2025, there will have to be an election, in accordance with the New Ireland Provincial Standing Orders,” clarified secretary Leo.
“If only one of the Open MPs resigns to become eligible for the Governor’s post, that Open
MP will have to be seconded and the Deputy Chairman will declare him as the Provincial
Governor.”
Secretary Leo also advised that should the Deputy Governor wish to be eligible to be elected as the Provincial Governor on the floor of the Assembly, he will have to tender his resignation to the Minister.
An assistant Chairman will have to be appointed by the Assembly from amongst the members of the Assembly, to perform the duties of chairman during the Assembly sitting that elects the Provincial Governor.
The clerk of the New Ireland Legislative Assembly, Ao Ure, confirmed that voting will be carried out through an open ballot."
Beon escapee surrenders to police,06/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3465,"After nearly a year on the run, Jeremiah George, also known as ‘Maia’, a prison escapee from Beon Correctional Institution, has voluntarily surrendered to police in Madang province. This significant development was confirmed by Acting Superintendent Robert Baim, the Madang Provincial Police Commander.
George turned himself in on Monday, March 03rd at 11:00am at Old Jant Compound, located in ward 08 of the Madang Local Level Government. His surrender was made possible through the concerted efforts of his family members and local community leaders, highlighting the crucial role of community cooperation in law enforcement.
The decision to surrender came after George narrowly escaped a life-threatening situation, which prompted him to reach out through the Transnational Crimes Unit and the National Criminal Intelligence Unit.
George was one of three inmates who escaped from Beon Prison on April 04th, 2020. At the time, he was in custody facing charges for the alleged willful murder of David Sole in 2019, a case that drew significant public attention.
The other two escapees involved in the breakout included Issack Jack, alias ‘Iceman’, who was killed shot and died, and Gerard Manase, alias ‘Comens’, who is still at large. The trio have been linked to various criminal activities across the provinces of Madang and East Sepik. These activities have been under investigation, with some cases already reported, underscoring the ongoing challenges faced by law enforcement in the region.
Acting Superintendent Baim has called on the public to remain vigilant and to report any sightings of Manase, emphasizing the importance of community involvement in ensuring safety and security.
“Police will track down the remaining escapee. We encourage the community to cooperate and provide any information that may lead to his capture,” Baim stated.
He also appealed to any individuals still evading the law to surrender, particularly as the country approaches its 50th Independence Anniversary, a time for reflection and unity.
Jeremiah George, originally from Somudo village in the Angoram District of East Sepik, and Manam Island in the Bogia district of Madang, is married and a father of three.
Police investigations into the activities of the escapees continue, with authorities keen on resolving outstanding cases to bring justice and closure to affected communities and individuals."
Ivingoi Secondary to Resume Classes Following Peace Agreement,06/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3464,"Ivingoi Secondary School in Okapa is set to resume classes next Monday following the official signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the warring Navu and Yagareba clans earlier this week.
The school was forced to close after violent clashes erupted on campus, endangering students and staff.
Following weeks of negotiations, Provincial Education Board (PEB) Representative Robert Williams confirmed that the school could reopen.
The Okapa District Development Authority (DDA) CEO Kalabe Yabaimanta, along with key education and government officials, witnessed the signing.
District Education Manager Cyndi Easy, Inspector Hellen Hutu, East Okapa President Kepi Anako, and local police and church representatives also attended.
During the event, CEO Yabaimanta urged the community to protect educational institutions and warned that law enforcement would intervene if violence occurred again.
He announced that all secondary and high schools in Okapa would receive 4x4 Dyna trucks to support operations.
While teachers and students have been instructed to return over the weekend, Principal McKenzie Agusave and Board Chairman John Yaigu assured the public that full classes would resume on Monday.
The PEB has issued a final warning that any further violence will result in permanent school closure."
Niningi satisfied with court's decision,06/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3463,"The Minister for Justice and Attorney General Pila Niningi has applauded the Supreme Court in upholding the doctrine of Separation of Powers as enshrined under section 99 of the Constitution.
The Constitution has vested powers and responsibilities in the National Parliament, the National Executive Council, and the National Judicial System.
“In so far as such bodies are created independence of direction and control, they would be seen to be exercising the power of the people given to them as a direct grant by the Constitution.
“The Supreme Court, in its wisdom, has considered that it does not warrant an incursion by the Court upon the lawmaking power of the Parliament and confirmed that the Court's function remains one of construction.
“This shows that we have a robust and vibrant Judicial System and a healthy democracy in Papua New Guinea,” Niningi said.
The Attorney General made this statement after the five men bench of the Supreme Court refused Deputy Opposition leader James Nomane's application to restrain Parliament from dealing with a proposal amendment to Section 145 of the Constitution when Parliament resumes on March 11th, 2025.
Nomane filed an application in the Supreme Court under section 81 (1) of the Constitution. He was seeking declarations and orders regarding a notice of motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister dated November 27th 2024, which was not placed on the notice paper of the Parliament due to section 165 of the standing order.
Section 165 of the Standing Orders is about the renewal of motions.
While the trial of his application is pending, he moved an application for an interim order to restrain the Parliament from dealing with any manner or form of a proposed constitutional amendment entitled Constitutional Amendment (Motion of No Confidence Law) 2024 regarding a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister.
Nomane, through the application, claimed that if no such order is made, there is a risk that the Parliament will amend the Constitution.
He argued that if that amendment is made, his substantive application will become futile.
However, the Supreme Court refused his application on the grounds that the application lacked jurisdiction and to the extent that there is jurisdiction, it has not been enlivened.
Niningi on the other end, clarified that the proposed amendment to S145 of the Constitution intends to protect the way leadership is governed and gives confidence to the conduct of leadership in the country.
“That bill is intended to protect and give confidence to the people. Every time a Parliament is sitting, the Parliament deliberates on VONC. When we continue to do that, we do not achieve anything. We must give confidence to our people and ensure that investors confidence must be maintained.
“The law simply deliberated that once you lose the VONC, incumbent government will take an 18-month grace period. That’s the bill that is before the Parliament.
“The bill does not deprive the right of members of Parliament to vote and change the government; rather it outlines responsibility, stability and good governance,” Niningi added."
Igam Barracks Chapel upgraded,06/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3462,"Igam Barracks in Lae, Morobe Province, proudly opened its newly-upgraded chapel on Tuesday, March 4th.
The construction of Igam Barracks started in 1960 with the intention of developing the Pacific Islands Regiment (PIR).
The Australian government’s plan in the early 1960s was to have three battalions and three new barracks. The barracks are Taurama in Port Moresby, Moem in East Sepik Province and Igam in Lae.
While three barracks were built, only two battalions were raised due to funding constraints at that time.
Deputy Chief of Defence, Brigadier General Larry Opa, said the chapel was also built to cater for the pastoral needs of troops from both the Australian armed forces and the Papua and New Guinea Voluntary Rifles.
“This place was meant to be the future home of the 3rd Royal Pacific Islands Regiment but circumstances took another direction, and now it has become the home of the engineer battalion,” he outlined.
“Over the years, the Joint Forces College was also co-hosted here, including the air transport wing, which eventually moved to Port Moresby.
“So, this building that we’re standing in front of, on this occasion of its reopening, after almost 60 years. Although it has gone through various renovations, this one has more significance as it is occuring on the 50th anniversary of our independence.”
Brigadier General Opa acknowledged the presence of the Director General Pacific Division of the Australian Defence Force, Air Commodore Jo Brick. He appreciated her for making time to travel from Canberra, underlining that this speaks to the long history between the two forces.
In response, Air Commodore Brick said, “A lot of these engagements highlight the importance and depth of our relationship, as Brigadier Opa mentioned.
“Our relationship is deep and incredibly strong so it’s a great honour to be able to open this chapel, which is both an important place of worship and the observance of spirituality, but also a place for our communities and our nations to be together.”
The chapel refurbishment started in August 2024 and ended in December. Aside from the chapel, a new multi-purpose facility was also constructed."
Police welfare issues under investigation,06/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3461,"The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary is conducting an administrative investigation into the way police officers are being protected while on duty.
Police Commissioner David Manning said this when addressing the recent death of two police officers in Mendi, Southern Highlands Province recently.
Manning said the administration investigation will coincide with the criminal investigation that is on foot, to establish the facts that led to the death of the police officers.
“The administrative investigation will look at how we can do better in protecting our members and we are hoping that the result of this investigation will recommend to the executives on how we can best protect our members, and how we can tweak our Standard Operating Procedures to ensure the occurrence of this happening again in the future is minimized.
“I do note the concerns of the grieving families about the lack of support or responsive healthcare, that is also being taken onboard, and it will be part of the administrative investigation,” Manning said.
“I reassure the immediate families of the two constables that through our police legacy, we will continue to support the families, we will continue to provide for their children’s education, and we will do the honorable thing to put them to rest,” he said.
Meanwhile, Manning also raised concerns regarding the politicization of their death.
“Politicize whatever you want, but do not chip into the death of my policemen by propagating false information through social media, and by using this as a political gimmick because lives are not gimmick and be mindful that the police force values lives of its members,” Manning said.
Police Minister Peter Tisamalili Jnr shared similar sentiments. “The other political leaders who maybe on the opposite, do not use this opportunity to sensationalize an insight. Allow ordinary Papua New Guineans to voice their concerns through social media or newspapers. Your space is on the floor of Parliament. If you want to criticize the government, say it on the floor of Parliament. That is the most appropriate space and time for you to share your grievances or your concerns over the government,” Tsiamalili added."
Misleading social media posts fueling problems,05/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3457,"Concerns have been raised about the adverse effects of unverified information that’s being circulated on social media platforms, exacerbating problems, and causing panic, fear and disorder in the community.
These concerns were raised following the recent activities in the Eastern Highlands Province by the relatives of two deceased police officers in an attempt to gain the attention of the authorities.
Police said many of the information that were circulated on social media were unverified, leading to the public being misled about the situation.
The political leaders of Southern Highlands, Eastern Highlands, and the police hierarchy condemned the disrespectful approach by citizens who published and spread misinformation on social media without getting their facts right.
They said social media users were publishing unverified information, causing fear and anxiety, leading to social disorder and chaos in the country.
Minister for Police Peter Tsiamalili Jnr said this can have devastating effects.
“To the many social media users, we will not entertain fake information in our country. No more fake misinformation about roadblocks in the highlands highway, no more fake information about compensation, get your facts right before posting information,” he said.
In sharing similar sentiments, Southern Highlands Governor William Powi said if Papua New Guineans are not mindful of what they post on social media, it can break the fabric of Papua New Guinea’s law and law enforcement in the country.
“Social media is causing a lot of harm and destruction for the governance and the good reputation of this country in terms of the law and justice sector.
“Sending fake information from one end to another and creating social disharmony can undermine the institutions of governance.
“Therefore, Papua New Guineans must understand that law and order is not the responsibility of police but it is a shared responsibility by the community as well,” Powi added.
Tsiamalili said that despite the negativity on social media, the government is working to ensure there is peace and that disputes are dealt with following the right processes of law."
Call to observe National Women’s Day,05/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3454,"As the world approaches the International Women’s Day celebrations on the 8th of March, 2025,  the Secretary for Personnel Management Taies Sansan has issued a circular addressed to all Departmental Heads, Heads of Statutory Authorities, all provincial administrators, public health authorities and all public servants to prepare for our own National Women’s Day which falls on March 24th, 2025.
Secretary Sansan said this annual event provides a valuable opportunity to celebrate the achievements of women across the public service.
“By embracing diversity, be it national, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic, or political , we can honour the contributions of women of all walks of life.
“This event is recognized by the United Nations and it aligns with the International Women’s Day and encourages us to strive further progress and equality for women everywhere.” She said.
The International Women’s Day theme; “For all women and girls: Rights, Equality and Empowerment” calls for action that can unlock equal rights, power and opportunities for all and an equal future where no one is left behind. Central to this vision is empowering the next generation- youth, particularly young women and adolescent girls – as catalyst for lasting change.
“Papua New Guinea is celebrating its 50th anniversary with the theme, celebrate our History, Inspire our Future. It is a time for the country to reflect on its journey and contribute to its future.
The theme of the National Women’s Day is; “Embrace 50 years, Take Action for Empowered future.” This theme encourages us to reflect on the progress and contributions that women had made across all sectors and walks of life over the years. It inspires us to continue acting towards a better future. It emphasizes the importance of celebrating the issue of women’s rights, equality, and empowerment in the public service, while also empowering future generations on their journey towards achieving equality.
Public service plays a significant role in being fair, equal and inclusive employer for all individuals. All agencies are encouraged to organize activities on National Women’s Day to commemorate  and celebrate within your respective agencies."
PNG’s security relationships built on trust,05/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3451,"Papua New Guinea has a shared history with Australia and values its friends.
These shared values have shaped the nation in its fifty years of nationhood.
‘Friends to all, Enemies to none’ formed the pathway to foreign relationships, many of which emerged from common land and maritime boundaries and shared values.
Minister for Defence, Dr Billy Joseph in a statement said the relationship developed together between Australia and Papua New Guinea, as close neighbors has provided the impetus to foster common national security interests.
“PNG Defence Force is committed to our long tradition of engaging with our Pacific partners to collectively meet and respond to regional security needs, as articulated in the Biketawa 2000 and Boe 2018 Declarations and as can be seen through multilateral institutions such the South Pacific Defence Ministers’ meeting and the Pacific Islands Forum.”
He said PNG values all of its bilateral relationships and partnerships, including the support received from its international defence cooperation through various bilateral and multilateral engagements.
PNGDF’s cooperation and engagement with international partners is conducted according to PNG’s foreign policy settings and principles for engagement.
This cooperation and engagement is crucial as it strengthens Defence's ability to meet its mandated tasks and provides an avenue for Defence to enhance its understanding of the regional and international security environments.
PNGDF has strong established relationships with its key partners, which include but are not limited to Australia, New Zealand, the U.S. and Indonesia.
“The support PNG has received from Australia, and the U.S on the Lombrum Redevelopment Project, on Manus is unprecedented.
“This facility will enable the PNGDF to conduct maritime operations combating illegal fishing, transitional crime and border protection.
“This enhances the ability of the Force to meet its Constitutional functions to defend PNG and its territory. Our partners understand the importance PNG places on the Treaty of Rarotonga.
“Papua New Guinea must also choose its bilateral relationships based on longstanding historical ties, intertwined security interests, deep interpersonal links, shared democratic values, and mutual interest for a safer and peaceful region.”"
"“There is no excuse”, says Unitech registrar",05/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3449,"The arrest of students at the Papua New Guinea University of Technology by police in Lae, should serve as a warning to the rest of the students.
Fourteen male students were arrested and charged for being ‘drunk and disorderly’ at the main Unitech gate on Saturday, March 01st, at 3am.
They made headlines when they were charged K4,000 each, or serve two years in prison, by District Court magistrate, Nasiling Bingtau.
Unitech Registrar, Veronica Thomas, said the Council and Senior Executive Management Team does not condone the behaviour of the 14 students.
She underlined the university’s ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy; a message that was relayed to students during the two weeks of orientation and registration.
Additionally, a large billboard with a similar message is displayed right in front of the gate.
“We have strict rules that we apply here on campus; however, if students are caught outside the university's fence, drinking, fighting, or breaking the law in general, the police will deal with them. We will not interfere with the process or come to their rescue – the law applies,” emphasised the registrar.
“There is no excuse for their actions.
“What these students have demonstrated at the beginning of the 2025 academic year is a complete disregard for their education and the efforts of their parents, guardians, and sponsors.”
Mrs. Thomas stated that university management and staff are making strides to improve the quality of education and systems, with the recent accreditation of engineering programs and ongoing benchmarking of non-engineering courses. This behaviour contradicts what the university has been striving to achieve.
“The majority of the students are serious about their education, but there are also irresponsible students whose behaviour tarnishes the university's image.”
She noted that the institution has academic policies in place that will determine the fate of these students’ education following the court case and the number of days they have missed class.
“If the zero-tolerance policy is breached on campus, rules for suspension will automatically apply. Penalty ranges from one to three years of suspension maximum,” she stated.
Thomas added that this will serve as a lesson to all university students throughout the rest of the year;  they are not immune to the laws, and they must behave as responsible citizens."
PNG benefits from ADF sports program,05/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3447,"The Papua New Guinea sporting community is benefiting from enhanced accreditation and development opportunities through the Australian Defence Force (ADF) International Sports Program. This initiative, conducted in partnership with several key organizations including the National Rugby League (NRL) Australian Football League (AFL) Sports Medicine Australia, and the Federation of International Touch Football, aims to deliver comprehensive training programs for coaches, referees, and sports trainers.
The program offers a range of educational and practical training opportunities, including:
- Level 1 Coaching Certification
- Referee Training
- Sports Trainer Certification
- First Aid Training
- Healthy Lifestyle Education
- Strength and Conditioning Programs
All these initiatives are facilitated by ADF personnel and internationally accredited sports experts.
Yesterday (04 March 2025), over 30 participants, comprising community-based coaches, trainers, and referees from rugby league and touch rugby, gathered at the Sir John Guise Stadium. The day's activities transitioned from classroom theory to practical outdoor drills, covering fundamental skills such as passing, attacking, and defensive techniques.
ADF Warrant Naval Officer, Head Coach and lead facilitator, Shane Bullock, alongside Nigel Hukula, PNGRFL Community Rugby League Development Officer, oversaw the rugby league drills. Their focus was on hands-on training that emphasized the fundamentals of the game, which they believe is critical for grassroots development.
Bullock expressed his admiration for the skill levels displayed by some of the participants, noting a keen eagerness to learn among coaches of all levels.
“To me, it shows that everyone is so keen to get in and learn more in PNG, which is really good. The skill level is actually really good with a lot of these coaches, varying from senior teams down to junior kids. The grassroots is the important part, and the participation has been really good so far.”
He further highlighted the importance of having a structured training plan. He emphasized that coaches should approach their training with a clear plan to ensure consistency and to foster a shared understanding among participants.
Bullock’s vision for coaching extends beyond mere technical instruction; he believes it encompasses instilling values such as respect-for oneself, fellow players, officials, and the community. He encourages coaches to focus on personal development alongside athletic performance:
“I think it’s big for them to learn that coaching is just about teaching everyone to play rugby league. It’s about teaching them values of respect-respect for themselves, for players, for officials and coaches, and for their community. This way, they can return to their communities not just as better football players but as better people.”

In a media statement made today, Governor Peter issued an immediate call to halt connect PNG Program to protect the Papuan region from the escalating security threats. Without proper security measures in place, the program is deemed to be a national security threat to the Papuan region.
She expressed concern that without proper security measures, these road networks are fast-tracking lawlessness, illegal migration, and land grabbing, placing enormous strain on provincial law enforcement, public services, and local communities.
Governor Peter has proposed a number of immediate security measures which includes security posts at provincial borders to monitor movement of people and the immediate halt to the Connect PNG program expansion into the Papua region through Central, Gulf and the nation’s capital, and.
Her concerns stem from the recent spate of violence across the country, especially in provinces that share a common border with the Central Province. She is now calling for backing from other members of parliament representing Papua New Guineans in the Papua region."
Petition for justice,05/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3445,"Leaders of the Eastern Highlands government have presented a petition to provincial leaders of Southern Highlands Province and the Royal PNG Constabulary executives in relation to the death of two police officers in Mendi recently.
The petition was presented by the relatives of the deceased to EHP Governor Simon Sia, in Goroka last week. Sia today presented the petition to the leaders of SHP and the Police.
Present to receive the petition was Governor for Southern Highlands, William Powi, Member for Mendi Raphael Tonpi, Police Minister Peter Tsiamalili Jnr, and Commissioner of Police David Manning.
Governor Sia said the petition presentation was to ensure the rule of law is upheld and proper processes followed to deal with this issue.
Member for Goroka, Aiye Tambua highlighted the content of the petition making the point that it does not contain compensation requirements. Rather, he said it calls for justice to be served before both men are buried.
Governor Powi said they have taken a collective approach to deal with this issue. Directives have been issued to the Southern Highlands Provincial Police Commander to work with his counterpart in Eastern Highlands in the investigation.
Powi said so far three suspects have been arrested, and a firearm returned to police in Mendi.
Commissioner Manning reassured relatives of the deceased that police will continue to support them through their investigations and that justice will be served."
"Ijivitari DDA, SILAG partner in training",04/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3444,"The Ijivitari District Development Authority (DDA) in Northern province has launched a partnership with the Somare Institute of Leadership and Governance (SILAG) with a K140, 000 cheque presented to the institution this week.
The district is the first in the country to partner with SILAG to expedite funds to train its public servants and school leavers, according to SILGAG’s Chief executive officer, Michael Barobe.
Local MP and Vice Minister for Finance, David Arore, when handing over the cheque on Monday said, he was humbled to honor the DDA’s commitment made last year to partner with the SILAG to train its public servants and school leavers to boost its public service delivery mechanism in the district.
‘’We made a commitment last year to come into partnership with SILAG to train our public servants and school leavers who want to pursue careers in the public service and also provide pathways for them.
‘’And I am humbled to say that the commitment is realized today with the first batch of K140, 000 paid today.’’
He stressed that the main reason for the partnership with SILAG was to empower public servants in the area to deliver.
He said, ‘’We have three based LLGs that are rural based and it is within Ijivitari DDA’s interest that we work around the clock to making sure that we have enough trained public servants in our LLGs to move forward the district.”
He said with the training of school leavers in attaining basic public service courses is to empower their skills and knowledge to work in the district and deliver services within the district and LLGs where it is possible.
‘’Thus, I am happy to announce that we are making a pathway to improve public service delivery mechanism in the district through this partnership with SILAG,’’ he added.
Barobe said this initiative empowers the public service delivery mechanism in the district.
‘’Our courses and training programs are all based on government policies, transpiring in districts, provinces and at the national government level.
“We deliver training based on job descriptions. They become competent public servants when they go out from here,” he said.
A further payment of K255, 000 will be made later in the year that accumulates a fixed funding of K355,000 to SILAG for the training."
Expatriates sworn-in as police directors,04/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3442,"Two expatriates were sworn in as directors in the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC), in Port Moresby today.
Chief Superintendent Rodney Swain will be serving as the Director for the Training wing, and Chief Superintendent Glyn Lewis will be serving as the Executive Director of the National Fraud and Anti-Corruption Directorate. Both were sworn in by Commissioner of Police David Manning. Police Minister Peter Tsiamalili Jnr and other police executives witnessed the occasion.
As part of the PNG-Australian Policing Partnership, Chief Superintendents Swain and Lewis are the first front-line police officers brought into the force as international experts. They join the current 6,700 ranks in the force.
Minister Tsiamalili said, “Rebuilding a professional and modern police force means having police expertise where it is needed and when its needed.
“These officers will be operating under the laws of PNG guided by the conduct of RPNGC. They will work closely with our front-line police, bringing in with them a wealth of experience and expertise.”
Manning said the involvement of these expatriates bridges the gap that has been lacking in terms of international expertise in the force.
“They are sworn into the RPNGC under PNG law, and they will be serving our police force and serving our people,” he said.
Manning thanked the directors for putting their hands up to serve the people of Papua New Guinea. He said their involvement signifies their determination to contribute to the development of the force."
PNG expands visa-on-arrival to more countries,04/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3440,"Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, has officially announced the addition of three countries to the existing visa-on-arrival (VOA) eligible country list.
“Passport holders from the United Kingdom (UK), Canada, and Singapore, are now eligible to get visa-on-arrival in Papua New Guinea,” Rosso said.
Rosso, who is also responsible for the Immigration and Border Security Ministry, said that effective immediately, passport holders from the UK, Canada, and Singapore, travelling on ordinary and official passports can get visa-on-arrival for short-stays of up to 60 days.
The VOA facility is only available at the Jackson’s International Airport in Port Moresby for all eligible countries.
“The VOA will be granted to those who travel for leisure, holiday, tourism, and visiting families and friends for short-stay purposes only. Those who travel for employment and long-stay visas must apply online before they travel,” he said.
“Passport holders from these three countries are also eligible for a business short-term single-entry visa-on-arrival. All conditions under the short-term business visa apply, including the Migration Service Fee of US$ 190 Dollars.”
Rosso said the government is reciprocating VOA with countries who offer the same to Papua New Guinea nationals. These arrangements are based on strategic assessments and risks factors.
The inclusion of the UK, Canada, and Singapore, now adds to the list of countries who are eligible for VOA in PNG. Other countries include Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, New Caledonia, American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, the United States territories of Guam and Northern Mariana Islands, and the French territories of French Polynesia (Tahiti) and Wallis and Futuna.
Chief Migration Officer of Papua New Guinea, Wellington Navasivu, said that countries with existing VOA arrangements under bilateral agreements for stays up to 60 days, include Israel for all passport holders, and Japan, China, and Indonesia for official, service, and diplomatic passports.
Holders of Indonesian official and diplomatic passports can also enter through the Wutung Border Post under the conditions of the existing bilateral arrangement.
“ICSA and the Department of Foreign Affairs are negotiating VOA arrangements with other countries which Papua New Guinea shares common interests with,” Navasivu said.
Rosso said the new VOA arrangements will create more opportunities in tourism, business, and trade."
Academic integrity emphasised,04/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3439,"Academic integrity was emphasised during the orientation of postgraduate students at the PNG University of Technology in Lae, Morobe Province.
With the theme: “Empowering changemakers: Research for a better tomorrow”, Acting Dean of the Faculty of Postgraduate Studies, Research and Innovation, Dr Shoeb Syed, emphasised that postgraduate students deal with research, hence academic integrity must always be part of their work ethic.
“So, in academic integrity, plagiarism comes in. It plays a part in it,” he stated. “You don’t copy somebody else’s work and declare that ‘It’s my work’. That’s nothing but plagiarism. And it’s a very big sin in academia.
“That’s why you have to be careful about plagiarism.”
To avoid the consequences of plagiarism, such as disciplinary actions or damage to reputation, proper citation needs to be given.
“If you take someone’s work, you cite it,” continued Dr Syed, who has been at Unitech since 2019.
“You tell them that, ok, I am using from his work. When you do that, then you are free from plagiarism.
“In many universities, there are dire consequences for it. They will remove you from your studies completely. They’ll investigate you so you will not be able to complete your studies. In other countries, you won’t even be able to enter other universities.”
Dr Syed also encouraged the postgraduate students to aim for excellence in their respective fields.
Unitech’s postgraduate school offers 18 course-based master’s programs, 22 Master of Philosophy programs and 22 Doctor of Philosophy programs; a total of 62 programs offered by the 13 academic schools. This is the largest range of postgraduate programs offered in the country.
This year, 239 students have enrolled for the two semesters. This consists of 104 new students and 135 continuing students.
This year has seen an increase of 79 students for postgraduate studies, including a Queen Elizabeth Commonwealth Scholar who will be pursuing his Master of Engineering in Civil Engineering."
"Peace agreement breached, no compensation",04/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3437,"Controller of State of Emergency in Porgera, Chief Superintendent Joseph Tondop has ordered that no compensation be paid to the relatives of the men killed on Sunday at the Porgera Mine.
He said this is because there was a breach of an existing peace agreement as stipulated in Clause D of the Emergency Peace Agreement (EPA) about Illegal Mining.
The controller stated that the councilors of Sakar Mamai and Piande clans signed the EPA for and on behalf of their clan members stating that they will not engage in illegal mining activities of any kind or support anyone engaging in this activity.
Tondop further outlined parts of the agreement under this clause where the councilors on behalf of their people accepted and agreed in the EPA that they will not condemn or demand compensation of any kind from any other person or party, whether a party to this agreement or not, if a member of their clan is killed within the open mine pit. They declared that such deaths shall be considered, seen and accepted as ‘FREE DEATH'.
Chief Superintendent Tondop further stated that the open pit is a restricted area with blasts going off at any time. Nobody is permitted anywhere inside the pit unless duly authorised by New Porgera Limited. He said residents of the SML area have been warned numerous times not to enter the pit as it was dangerous.
The incident on Sunday was a result of illegal miners entering the pit with firearms ready to attack other illegal miners over territorial rights within the open pit – land that is State owned and leased to NPL and hence over which they have no rights whatsoever.
“I have directed SOE Investigative Task Force members under the Command of Senior Inspector Mack Anema to investigate events leading to death of IMs (illegal miners) in the pit, destruction of mine equipment, injuries sustained by mine staff as well as IMs, other innocent civilians and sabotaging of public road infrastructure at Yonge village in Laiagam by the Sakar Tribe.
This investigation is necessary to establish the facts surrounding this matter and ascertain criminal culpability by all parties involved including members of the security forces. Where criminal conduct is identified, appropriate actions will be taken. This is necessary to restore credibility in the criminal justice system and respect for the rule of law,” Tondop further stated."
Disaster Resilience Program Launched,04/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3434,"Papua New Guinea (PNG) has launched an advanced disaster resilience initiative to improve preparedness and response for vulnerable communities.
The Building Safety and Resilience in the Pacific Phase II (BSRP II) project was officially launched on Monday, March 03, 2025 at the Holiday Inn in Port Moresby, officiated by Secretary for the Department for Community Development and Religion, Jerry Ubase, and Director of the National Disaster Centre, Laso Mana.
Director Mana thanked the South Pacific Community (SPC) and the European Union (EU) for its commitment to strengthening PNG’s resilience to natural hazards, aligning with Mission 2050 and the Medium-Term Development Plan 4 (MTDP4).
“The effectiveness of early warning information relies on the establishment of multifaceted, multilayered, and integrated projects and programs. The BSRP project aims to improve and strengthen this framework.
“By understanding our common natural hazard risks and their implications for human security, we can optimize early warning systems to ensure effective information flow both vertically and horizontally,” said Mr. Mana in his opening remarks.
Secretary Ubase also thanked the support of the SPC and the EU in strengthening PNG’s disaster preparedness, particularly for women, girls, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.
“As the department committed to protecting rights and empowering all aspects of human life, we emphasize ensuring a safety net for women, girls, the elderly, and people with disabilities, particularly in disaster risk reduction efforts.
“To enhance accessibility to essential services, we are establishing District Community Development Centres (DCDC), which will serve as mini-departments at the district level.
“These centres will deliver mandated programs, including Social Impact Assessments on Disaster Impacts, to promote a healthier, safer, and more sustainable environment for all communities,” Ubase said.
Funded by the EU under the 11th European Development Fund, the EUR 14 million project spans 14 Pacific Island nations and Timor-Leste. Given PNG’s vulnerability to seismic activity, extreme weather, and climate-related disasters, this initiative is a crucial step toward sustainable development.
Joining via Zoom, SPC’s Geoscience, Energy, and Maritime Division Director, Rhonda Robinson, described the launch as a significant milestone in building resilient Pacific communities. She emphasized the importance of strengthening early warning systems, improving infrastructure, and ensuring inclusive disaster planning.
The project’s National Steering Committee in PNG includes representatives from the National Disaster Centre, National Weather Service, Port Moresby Geophysical Observatory, Department of Community Development and Religion, and Department of Education."

Partnership forged to address littering,04/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3430,"The Madang Provincial Government and PNG Fire Service have partnered to keep the Madang township clean by installing rubbish drums.
On Sunday (March 2nd) 20 rubbish drums were installed in town, at bus stops, shopping centres and the town market parameters to ensure people who congregated there dispose of their rubbish appropriately.
Seemingly, over the years, piles of rubbish have been heaped in certain areas within town becoming an eyesore for the general public.
Madang governor, Ramsy Pariwa said the town has gone filthy and the proper authorities who are supposed to ensure cleanliness within have not performed, prompting the provincial government to take up this initiative.
Pariwa has made an open call to the people of Madang to join him in a clean-up exercise on Saturday (8th March). He said the general public has to take ownership of the town and ensure that no one is unnecessarily littering.
Governor Pariwa stressed to the people that they should not rely on the government all the time and that town cleanliness is everybody’s business.
Provincial Fire Services Commander, Superintendent Albert Uramani said apart from emergency responses, they also have a duty towards community obligations, and are happy to be part of the community clean-up.
Commander Uramani is calling on other government sectors and business houses to follow suit and join in the cleanathon."
How Mt Wilhem's frogs are vulnerable to climate peril,04/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3429,"As dusk descends upon the misty slopes of Papua New Guinea's Mt. Wilhelm, a solitary chirp pierces the silence, soon joined by a multitude of tiny voices, swelling into a vibrant nocturnal chorus.
These harmonious calls emanate from the mountain's diverse and often-overlooked frog populations, residing in an extraordinary home high among the clouds.
A recent study led by Dr. Chris Dahl and a team of researchers has revealed that the diversity of frog species along Mt. Wilhelm-Papua New Guinea’s tallest peak-follows a striking pattern, one that could redefine our understanding of amphibian biodiversity in tropical mountains.
Their findings, published in the journal ""Biotropica"", show that frog diversity reaches a dramatic peak at mid-elevations, between 1,700 and 2,000 metres above sea level, before tapering off at the highest reaches of the mountain.
What’s more, species turnover-the replacement of one species with another along the gradient-happens at an astonishingly rapid rate, making this remote mountain a natural laboratory for studying evolution, adaptation, and the potential impacts of climate change.
A Rainforest rising into the sky
Mt. Wilhelm, soaring 4,509 metres above sea level, presents a unique natural experiment in species distribution. From the humid, insect-rich lowlands to the windswept, stunted forests near the tree line, the mountain hosts a diverse range of ecological niches.
To uncover the patterns of amphibian diversity, Dahl’s team established eight survey sites, spaced at 500-metre elevation intervals, between the riverine forests at 200 metres and the rugged, moss-covered slopes at 3700 metres.
Over 3,390 individual frogs were recorded across these sites, representing 55 species from five distinct families.
The Microhylidae family, known for its ground-dwelling species with direct-developing eggs (bypassing the tadpole stage), dominated the montane environments, while the lowlands harboured a mix of both aquatic and terrestrial breeders.
The mystery of mid-elevation peaks
The study uncovered an unexpected trend: species richness (the number of different species in a given area) peaked at mid-elevations rather than gradually decreasing with altitude, as might be expected in harsher conditions.
This so-called “mid-elevation diversity bulge” has been observed in other mountain ecosystems, such as the Andes and the Himalayas, but its exact causes remain debated.
Several factors could be at play.
Mid-elevations may provide the ideal balance of temperature, humidity, and food availability, with fewer predators like frog-eating snakes that dominate the lowland forests.
Alternatively, high rates of speciation in montane environments-where populations are often isolated-could be driving the emergence of new species with narrow elevation ranges.
In contrast, the lowlands, though vast and teeming with life, exhibited lower beta diversity, meaning that species compositions remained relatively stable across large distances.
Clues to climate change vulnerability
One of the most concerning findings of the study was the narrow elevational range of most species.
More than half of the frog species observed were confined to a vertical band of less than 500 metres.
This suggests that even minor climatic shifts-such as rising temperatures pushing species upslope-could lead to significant disruptions in frog communities. For species already clinging to the uppermost reaches of their range, there may be nowhere left to go.
Climate change isn’t the only threat.
Although Papua New Guinea’s amphibians have so far remained largely unaffected by the deadly chytrid fungus, which has devastated frog populations in Australia and Central America, researchers warn that the disease’s introduction could have catastrophic effects.
Monitoring efforts like those conducted on Mt. Wilhelm will be crucial in tracking potential threats and developing conservation strategies.
Why mountains matter for global bio diversity
Beyond its implications for frogs, this research unveils the critical role of tropical mountains as biodiversity hotspots.
The study found that species turnover along the elevational gradient was so steep that moving just 500 metres up the mountain led to as much change in community composition as traveling 200 kilometres across New Guinea’s lowland forests.
This highlights the fine-scale ecological partitioning that allows an extraordinary number of species to coexist in such a confined space.
The highlands of New Guinea have long been known for their biological treasures, but studies like this reveal just how delicate these ecosystems are.
As climate change, habitat loss, and disease loom on the horizon, understanding these natural patterns of diversity and adaptation is more important than ever.

Looking into the future
Dahl and his team hope their research will serve as a baseline for future ecological monitoring in Papua New Guinea.
Establishing long-term study sites could provide crucial insights into how mountain species respond to environmental change over time.
For now, the frogs of Mt. Wilhelm continue their nocturnal symphony, hidden in the mists of one of the world’s last great wildernesses. But their survival depends on what we do next.
Did you know?
Papua New Guinea is home to over 400 described species of frogs, with many more yet to be formally named.
• Some highland frog species lay their eggs in damp leaf litter rather than in water, an adaptation that allows them to thrive in cloud forests.
• The chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), which has wiped out amphibian populations worldwide, has not yet been detected on Mt. Wilhelm-but scientists are keeping a close watch.

Heavy police presence at Lae settlement,04/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3423,"Nawaeb Block, in Lae, is calm this morning as students and the working class are seen making their way to their respective busstops along Buimo Road.
Two vehicles with police personnel are parked in the middle of the road, with armed officers monitoring the area.
Police presence is heavy there due to a confrontation between a group from Kagua, Southern Highlands Province, and criminal elements at the settlement.
Lae metropolitan superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, said this follows an incident last weekend when a taxi belonging to a Kagua man was reportedly held up at Nawaeb Block.
The taxi driver allegedly retaliated and seriously injured one of the suspects.
“The suspect was rescued by his associates from the Angau hospital last week and they gathered in numbers and demanded compensation from the Kaguas on Sunday, and again yesterday (March 3) morning,” said Kunyanban.
“During that time, one Pangia and a Kagua received pellet wounds after the compensation meeting failed.”
Situation was tense yesterday morning with a large crowd gathering around a burning house.
Police intervened, with the situation looking to be under control, until a surpise attack was launched in the afternoon against the SHP group, resulting in several of their houses being burnt down.
Police responded and chased the criminal elements and their sympathisers up the hills behind Birdwing Homes, at Buimo Road.
Kunyanban said police presence will be maintained at the location. However, he is urging residents to take precautions when traveling that way.
“Some of the criminals might be injured,” he continued.
“Any reports or sightings of injured people, please inform police as soon as possible.”"

Free Health Checks For Police Officers,04/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3417,"More than 700 police officers at Boroko Police Station will receive free health checks later today as part of a partnership between Pacific International Hospital (PIH) and the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
The Basic Health Check Initiative, scheduled for Tuesday, March 4, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM, will offer Body Mass Index assessments, blood sugar tests, and blood pressure monitoring. This helps officers monitor their health and identify potential risks early.
The program is part of a broader effort to support police officers who often struggle to prioritize their well-being due to the demands of their jobs. Officers requiring further medical attention will also be eligible for a 20% discount on outpatient consultations at PIH.
This is the first in a series of planned health check initiatives targeting police stations across Papua New Guinea. Organizers are encouraging all officers at Boroko Police Station to take advantage of the free screenings.

"Law and order crisis result of neglect over years, PM says",03/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3416,"Prime Minister James Marape in rejecting calls for his resignation said the law and order crisis in PNG is a result of years of neglect by successive governments.
The Prime Minister in a statement said the law and order crisis the country is going through was not a sudden problem.
“We inherited a force in complete decline with little capacity at every level. Even the commissioner’s office lacked resources and trained personnel.”
Despite this, he stressed that he has personally taken steps to restore discipline, resources, and leadership within the police force, including:
• Increased police training and recruitment, which he says has been absent for over a decade.
• Major reforms to strengthen the police force, including re-training officers and improving command structures.
• And improved coordination between security agencies, including Defence, National Intelligence, and the Attorney General’s Department.
“Despite these challenges, we are rebuilding the system. These reforms take time. Simply replacing a Prime Minister, Minister, or Police Commissioner will not solve anything overnight.”
Responding to calls for his resignation, he described these calls as reckless and coming from political opportunists to exploit social tensions for political gain.
“From my end, I see a pattern emerging from the Deputy Opposition Leader James Nomane, and I am not surprised. Some in the opposition believe they can ascend to government by exploiting social issues and tensions on the ground. This modus operandi has become apparent,” Prime Minister Marape said. He even likened this trend to that of January 10, 2024, claiming that senior MP approached him back then in the presence of the Deputy Prime Minister and a provincial governor and urged him to resign, claiming he had lost public support and that lawlessness had worsened.
“Days later, the January 10 unrest happened, and suddenly, the calls for my resignation became louder. Now, I see history repeating itself,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister made it clear that resigning is not the solution to the challenges facing Papua New Guinea. “The job of a Prime Minister is not to resign at every crisis—it is to lead, coordinate, and allocate resources to address national challenges. That is exactly what we are doing.”
He emphasised that in 2024 alone, the government allocated the highest level of funding ever to police and law enforcement, taking real steps to fix the problems instead of simply shifting blame.
Meantime, the Pime Minister met with key security agencies, including the Police, Defence, Attorney General, National Intelligence Office (NIO), and Correctional Services (CS), and delivered a blunt message:
“It is time for them to step up and deliver. Our government is providing them with more resources than any past administration, and in return, we expect results. It is not the Prime Minister’s job to micromanage their responsibilities—they must work around the clock to restore law and order. If anyone should be working 20 hours a day, it is the police and all security agency heads.”"
Workshop to improve police training standards,03/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3414,"The National Center of Excellence recently conducted a two-day leadership workshop aimed at monitoring and evaluating the training component of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
A workshop was held on February 26 and 27, which brought together trainers within the Royal PNGC to review the training modules of the force, identify issues, and create dialogue on how to deal with those issues. The PNG-Australian Policing Partnership funded the workshop.
Assistant Commissioner of Police, Perou N’Dranou said misconceptions surrounding the training component of the force warranted the need to have this workshop and improve training standards.

The ACP hopes for similar workshops to be held annually to ensure trainers are well prepared to train recruits."
Public servants working remotely directed to relocate,03/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3412,"The Ombudsman Commission has directed all public servants operating out of their provinces to relocate to their designated locations.
The OC issued the directive on February 6th to all provincial administrators and staff, the district chief executive officers, and staff who are operating outside to immediately relocate to their rightful place of work. The directive takes effect on Thursday, March 6th, 2025.
In a statement, the Ombudsman Commission highlighted that they were aware of public servants operating outside the designated locations or in Port Moresby.
“Operating outside the designated location is improper as there are legally defined administrative boundaries within which these Public Servants must serve.
“This practice not only disrupts effective service delivery to the respective Provinces and Districts but it also undermines the principles of good governance, accountability and transparency,” said the Ombudsman Commission.
“It is imperative for all relevant Provincial Administrators, the Provincial Administration Staff, the Chief Executive Officers of the District Development Authorities, and the District Administration Staff to take note and cooperate with the Ombudsman Commission by relocating to their designated locations.
“As leaders, the provincial administrators and the CEOs of the DDAs are required under Section 23 of the Organic Law on the Duties and Responsibilities of Leadership to co-operate with the Ombudsman Commission.”
The Ombudsman further stated that the provincial, DDA and district administration staff, are persons to whom the National Goals and Directive Principles and the Basic Social Obligations apply and they must act in the spirit of the Constitution by giving effect to the National Goals and Directive Principles.
“You are therefore encouraged to comply with the Basic Social Obligations as far as it is within your respective powers to relocate immediately and perform your duties in the provinces and districts.
“Should you fail to comply with this Directive, you may be subject to enforcement proceedings in the National Court under Section 23 of the Constitution.”
The OC called for cooperation and adherence to this directive."
"Dreger students seek refuge, situation still tense",03/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3410,"Over 40 students are seeking refuge at the Gagidu Police Station, in Finschhafen, Morobe Province, following a drunken brawl at the Dregerhafen Secondary School.
Gagidu Rural Police Station Commander, Inspector Dominic Livar, said the fight was instigated yesterday by intoxicated individuals from Pindiu, in the Hube Rural Local Level Government (LLG).
Based on reports, Mape students retaliated after the group from Hube allegedly damaged their pots and plates when the Mape group refused to share food with them.
Fighting ensued and an old ablution building that was converted into a makeshift dormitory was burnt down.
“There was no loss of life but tension is very high,” said Inspector Livar.
It is also understood that three Mape students were cut around that time, however, police are yet to establish whether that is from the confrontation with Hube students or prior to that.
Innocent students are affected by the incident, with those from Sialum and Pindiu seeking refuge at the Gagidu police barracks.
“This morning, I went into Dreger, the school was having an emergency meeting. Currently, there are no classes as well,” said Inspector Livar.
“We will be monitoring the situation for the next few days then the board will reconvene and we will seek directions from the Morobe Provincial Education Board.
“We are anticipating a retaliatory attack from Pindiu, and our hands are tied because we are also attending to an attack on two of our police personnel at Sattelberg. They were grievously wounded by over 20 youths there on the evening of February 26th. We are investigating to determine the cause of the attack.”
Finschhafen has three regular police officers, around 15 reservists, and an additional boost of manpower from the Mobile Squad 10 from Port Moresby, brought in by the local MP, and have been on ground since December 2024."

Meri Freedom Bags Empowering Women,03/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3406,"As International Women's Day 2025 approaches, with its theme ""Accelerate Action,"" the spotlight turns to initiatives like Meri Freedom Bags that embody this call to expedite gender equality.
Founded in 2019 by Ipswich local Gay Muller, Meri Freedom Bags has made significant strides in empowering women and girls in Papua New Guinea by addressing menstrual health challenges and fostering economic independence.
The organization has distributed over 6,000 reusable menstrual hygiene kits across PNG, providing essential items such as washable pads, underwear, and soap. These kits not only meet practical needs but also challenge cultural taboos surrounding menstruation, promoting dignity and confidence among recipients.
Beyond distribution, Meri Freedom Bags emphasises sustainability by training local communities to produce these kits. This initiative equips women with valuable sewing skills, fostering economic opportunities and self-reliance.
Such efforts align seamlessly with the International Women's Day 2025 theme, as they represent actionable steps toward accelerating gender equality.
The organization's impact extends further by enhancing school attendance among girls, reducing health risks associated with inadequate menstrual management, and challenging societal stigmas.
Meri Freedom Bags collaborated with Pamili Ministries in December 2024 to distribute 500 reusable sanitary bags in Rabaul, East New Britain, Papua New Guinea.
These contributions resonate with the broader goals of International Women's Day, emphasising rights, equality, and empowerment for all women and girls.
As we commemorate International Women's Day on March 8, 2025, the work of Meri Freedom Bags serves as a powerful example of how grassroots initiatives can drive meaningful change.
Through dedication and community collaboration, they are not only improving menstrual health but also uplifting the dignity and status of women in Papua New Guinea, embodying the essence of accelerating action for gender equality.

Call for respect of indigenous people,03/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3402,"The total disrespect of the marginalized people of Motu Koita and Koiari of Central Province has resulted in the upsurge of law-and-order issues in the city.
Moresby Northwest MP, Lohia Boe Samuel has blamed the increased widespread lawlessness on the disrespect of the indigenous people of Port Moresby city.
“Our land has been taken away from us by illegal squatters and various governments over the past 50 years. Settlements have become a breeding ground for criminals because Members of Parliament have failed our people by allowing settlements to flourish.
“People in settlements have become our voters so we have allowed them to settle without proper planning.
“No proper planning has caused many of our kids to become illiterates and are without jobs and have been facing hardships,” Samuel stressed.
“When a community is neglected over a long period, the youths in that community soon build in their minds an “Us versus Them” mentality which eventually breeds competent and hatred in their hearts and minds. Like yeast it grows and grows and results in such heinous and disposable actions of rape and murder of innocent females.”
Samuel further stressed that it is no easy fix, and there is no easy solution as this time bomb has been created and has been allowed to brew by society and past and current governments for over 50 years.
“Fifty years of neglect and the marginalization of my people of Motu Koita has resulted in such law-and-order issues.”
Samuel said a joint task force or a Think-Tank should immediately be set up by the Governor of NCDC Powes Parkop which should include MPs in NCDC and Central, police and selected members of the public to discuss ideas to address pressing issues."

The session also explored transitional shelter options for internally displaced populations, ensuring that displaced families have safe and dignified living spaces while permanent solutions are being developed. Another key focus was risk assessment for selecting safe relocation sites, ensuring that affected families are resettled in areas with minimal exposure to future hazards. The training also emphasized simple construction techniques to strengthen houses, equipping participants with practical methods to improve structural durability using locally available materials. Additionally, new applications for timber construction were explored, highlighting innovative ways to enhance shelter safety and sustainability.

Gov’t to strengthen security enforcement,03/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3400,"Amid growing security concerns in the county, the government has reaffirmed its commitment to strengthening law enforcement with police operations to intensity across the country to crack down on criminals and bring offenders to justice.
The Prime Minister, James Marape in a statement released recently said, “I have issued a direct instruction to the Police Commissioner to step up enforcement. While resources may sometimes be stretched, I want to assure the people of Papua New Guinea that no crime is ignored.
“Every case is documented, every offender is pursued, and justice will be done,” he assured.
He acknowledged that policing alone is not enough and called for a coordinated effort between law enforcement and community leaders.
“Police will arrest offenders, but it is the responsibility of Governors, councillors, and local leaders to ensure that peace is maintained within their communities.”
As Papua New Guinea approaches its 50th year of independence, the Prime Minister urged citizens to act responsibly and reject violence.
“We are not a young nation anymore. We are turning 50, and we must act like a mature country. Lawlessness should not define our future. I call on every citizen—young and old—to uphold the law, respect the rights of others, and work together to build a peaceful and prosperous Papua New Guinea.”
The Prime Minister concluded with a final appeal to all communities, especially those along the Highlands Highway.
“Do not destroy your future. Your road is a lifeline—it brings economic opportunity, education, healthcare, and development. Blocking it, damaging it, or intimidating those who use it will only harm your own people. Let us work together to maintain peace and order for the benefit of our nation.”"

The incident occurred despite repeated warnings and community engagement that there would be no tolerance for illegally threatening critical infrastructure. He said things are made much worse when illegal miners threaten personnel and security forces with firearms or bush knives.
""During an attempted incursion into a restricted area of the Porgera facility, armed illegal miners discharged firearms at security personnel.

K1mil for community development centre,02/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3395,"The people of Koroba Lake-Kopiago will soon have a community development centre, a vital facility that will serve as a hub for addressing law and order, family and sexual violence, community development, and small business support.
Member for Koroba Lake Kopiago and Minister for Coffee, William Bando recently presented a K1 million cheque from the Koroba-Lake Kopiago District Development Authority (DDA) to the Department for Community Development and Religion, fulfilling its commitment to establish the District Community Development Centre (DCDC).
“This K1 million is a demonstration of our commitment to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed on October 15, 2024.
“This funding will enable us to build a modern two-story building in our remote district.”
Bando said the centre will serve as a hub for addressing critical issues such as law and order, family and sexual violence, community development, and small business (SME) support.
It will house over 50 workstations, conference facilities, and a crucial transit lodge for survivors of gender-based violence and sorcery-related violence.
“I'm incredibly proud to be part of this initiative, which will bring much-needed services and support to our people. Thank you to Minister Jason Peter and Secretary Jerry Ubase for their partnership and dedication to rural development.
“A big thank you to District Administrator Stanley Kutan and District CEO for their efforts in ensuring the land in Koroba Township is ready for construction."
PM calls on leaders to address lawlessness,02/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3394,"All local leaders from the community to national levels have been urged to stand against lawlessness, and actively maintain peace in their respective areas.
“For the first time, my government has placed councilors on the payroll. If you want government support, you must first ensure that your communities are law-abiding. Your role is not to stand idly by while young people engage in reckless behavior—you must be the voice of authority in your communities,” he stated.
He stressed that MPs, governors, and local leaders must work together to prevent violence from escalating.
“Governors must ensure that peace and mediation teams in their provinces are functioning. If conflicts arise between different provinces, then peace mediation teams must be deployed immediately to resolve disputes before they spiral out of control.”
Recognising Papua New Guinea’s deep cultural traditions, the Prime Minister called for the restoration of community-based mediation and customary dispute-resolution mechanisms.
“In our culture, compensation and mediation play a critical role in resolving disputes. But these processes must be handled within the bounds of the law, led by village councillors, elders, and local authorities—not by mobs taking the law into their own hands,” he said.
He called on local communities to work with police rather than against them.
“If a crime has been committed, report it to the police and allow the justice system to function. Do not take matters into your own hands. If the police in your area are slow to act, escalate the issue to their superiors. Justice will be served, but it must be done legally.”"
Kapavore clarifies circulation of ART drugs,02/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3393,"Minister for Health and MP for Pomio, Elias Kapavore has called on Papua New Guineans to always take precautionary measures against HIV.
Kapavore made this call after clarifying the misrepresented information on the recent announcement by US on the cancellation of USAID and Anti-retroviral medication.
The Health Minister clarified that all drugs and reagents are purchased by the Government of Papua New Guinea through UNICEF, while the Global Fund supports with operational funds and a few commodities through the principal recipient, World Vision.
“Our available stock is for more than a month. I already discussed with UNICEF and World Vision to fly some ART drugs into the country.”
Kapavore made this clarification after misinformation on the cancellation of USAID after pulling out of the World Health Organisation.
“To clear the misrepresented information on USAID and the Anti-retroviral relationship, our public must know that USAID does not buy any HIV commodities for PNG.”
He said PNG will not experience any shortage of ART as we received the Commodity Funds in March but the slow approval and cheque clearance process of the Central Bank is slowing down the circulation.
“We still have K3.2m at Bank of PNG yet to be cleared. The lead time from Order to drugs arrival in PNG is 6-8 months now so holdup along the process is affecting our supply chain. That is having a negative toll on us.
“Our full estimate for one year is K27m but last year was K10m (K17m deficit) and this year is thankfully K12.5m (yet K15m short).”
However, Kapavore said despite the circulation, all people in the country must always take precautionary measures against HIV.
He said the cumulative total has gone past 72,000 with 6500 new HIV cases a year.
Furthermore, he explained that 44,000 are on ART and PNG cannot afford to increase this number so all sexually active people must be sexually responsible ie:  keep sex within marriage, abstain from sex, and wear a condom if they cannot control themselves.
“Sex outside of marriage is a sin and wages of sin is death. Be responsible.”"
PM calls for respect of law,02/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3392,"Prime Minister James Marape has issued a powerful and unequivocal call to all Papua New Guineans to uphold the rule of law, warning that no amount of justification can validate criminal acts.
He has also condemned recent incidents of violence, destruction, and illegal roadblocks, stressing that these actions not only endanger lives but also undermine the country’s economic and social stability.
“There is no justification for breaking one law to seek justice for another crime. Lawlessness does not solve problems—it only deepens them.”
Prime Minister James Marape made these remarks when highlighting a recent case in Tari, where police, with the support of the local community, successfully arrested a suspect involved in the killing of a police officer.
“The perpetrator is now behind bars, and the legal process is underway. This is the correct course of action—justice through the law, not through retaliatory violence.”
The Prime Minister further condemned those who use criminal behavior as a means of drawing attention to grievances as no excuse and no justification can validate committing another crime to protest an existing one.
He added that resorting to violence, destruction, and intimidation does not solve problems but creates more victims.
Marape aimed at the destruction and disorder along the Highlands Highway, warning that such actions jeopardize the very livelihoods of the people involved.
“My government has invested over K2 billion into upgrading the Highlands Highway which is a national asset, crucial for economic activities such as agriculture, small businesses, trade, and tourism.”
Marape said blocking roads, setting vehicles alight, and destroying property is reckless and self-defeating."
"Breaking Stigmas, One Stitch At A Time",02/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3391,"On February 28, fourteen women and four men received certificates after successfully completing a three-day sewing workshop at the Ginigoada Centre at Tutu Beach Retreat.
The training, conducted by Meri Freedom Bags in partnership with Ginigoada Foundation Inc., focused on sewing reusable sanitary kits to support women and girls in Papua New Guinea.
Dame Carol Kidu, Patron of Ginigoada, and Gay Muller, Founder of Meri Freedom Bags, presented the certificates, recognizing the participants’ commitment to learning new skills that contribute to healthier and more resilient communities.
The program introduced sewing techniques and provided essential health awareness training on nutrition, reproductive health, and mental well-being.
Meri Freedom Bags, an Australian-based nonprofit, was founded by Muller after she witnessed the challenges faced by PNG women due to period stigma while working as a nurse on the YWAM medical ship. ""I saw that women were ostracized from their villages during their periods, and it affected their dignity,"" she said.
Participants overcame minor setbacks, including a broken snap locker, and completed at least one sanitary bag each. The remaining bags will be finished and distributed to girls in the upper grades at Pari Primary School on March 3.
Ginigoada has since established a sewing training room, allowing both men and women to continue developing their skills. With growing interest in future workshops, plans are already underway for further training sessions.
This initiative marks a significant step toward breaking stigmas, restoring dignity, and fostering sustainable local production of reusable sanitary kits to benefit more communities in PNG."

International bikers visit Snow Pass,01/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3386,"They have only heard of ‘Snow Pass’ until they woke up with a ‘million-dollar view’ of Usino-Bundi, in Madang Province.
This was expressed by a United States team of nine adventure dirt bikers who rode all the way from Lae, courtesy of the Lae-based operator, Niugini Dirt.
The team had toured countries like Africa, Nepal, Mongolia and Peru before choosing PNG on their 26th expedition.
The team chose Papua New Guinea through Niugini Dirt’s promotion of PNG as an adventure dirt biking destination.
From Lae, the team biked to Bulolo and up to Aseki, in Menyama. They then biked to Aiyura and Asaro in Eastern Highlands to meet the mudmen before arriving at Snow Pass, Bundi, on a cold and wet afternoon of Monday, February 24th.
Despite the wet weather and long ride, they were warmly welcomed by the community of Snow Pass. The team was lodged at Snow Pass Eco-lodge at 2,200m above sea level for the night.
Owner of the Snow Pass Eco-lodge and community advocate, Vincent Kumura, said:
“At the dawn of the 25th, the team woke up to the flames of the ‘Imure Burning Head Dancers’, a local cultural group of Karizokara, Bundi. The breathtaking rare performance was nothing like what they had seen before anywhere in the world.
“They left Snow Pass at 10.30am on February 25th.
“With the exceptional hospitality coupled with the striking cultural performance amidst a million-dollar view all around, there's no doubt that the team had left with an indelible rare cut of PNG’s tourism and hospitality, something we hope they would treasure and share with others for many years to come,” expressed Kumura.
Kumura further applauded Lae’s Niugini Dirt for promoting PNG as an adventure biking destination in the world."

This is following the circulation of an unsigned press release carrying the emblem of Papua New Guinea and a purported stamp from the National Court of Waigaini, advising citizens to meet at Unagi Oval on Monday, March 03rd 2025 in a peaceful protest to call on the Prime Minister’s resignation.
Turi in a statement said police in the National Capital District and Central Provinces will be on full alert on Monday.
He confirmed that police had not received any formal request for a protest and as such any protest on Monday will be deemed illegal and those involved will be arrested and charged with Unlawful Assembly or gathering.
""The police had seen the document circulated on social media and had enquired who the author of the document is, but no one had turned up. This shows that the document is fake, and the police will not entertain any public gathering regarding that on Monday at Unagi or anywhere in the city. I have directed my commanders to inform their officers to be on alert to arrest and charge anyone. We do not want another crisis in the city like Black Wednesday last year,"" Turi said.
He further added that the institution that had their stamp on the document can file a formal complaint for the police to investigate the matter. He said currently there is no complaint at any police station in the city.
Commander Turi also encouraged the public to address issues following the right process that will not affect anyone or anything in the future. He said everyone has the right to raise their concerns but must follow the right process when doing so.
""With that I as the commander of NCD/Central discourages anyone who want to take part in that gathering because its not a formal gathering. If you are caught, you will be arrested and charged, Turi said."
Police beef up presence along Highlands Highway,01/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3382,"Police Commissioner David Manning, has confirmed that a significant police presence has been deployed along the Highlands Highway to ensure traffic along the Highlands Highway remains unimpeded by issue-motivated groups.
The Commissioner’s comments follow two unrelated incidents that caused the temporary closure of the Highway, one being illegal activity and the other a vehicle fire.
“Both matters are under investigation and one arrest has been made with more to follow,” Commissioner Manning said.
“Our policing environment remains challenging, but our investment in leadership and the front line is ensuring we are able to resolve highly-volatile matters more promptly and more professionally.
“This critical roadway was opened promptly by police, and remains open for use by the public.
“High-visibility police patrols of the highway and community engagement will continue to address issues that led to this unacceptable effort to impede the Highlands Highway.”
The closures occurred over two days with police removing an illegal roadblock near Goroka on Thursday, 27 February. Police also attended to a vehicle on fire near Mt. Hagen, early yesterday morning, 28 February.
While unrelated, both incidents caused the temporary closure of the Highlands Highway that Commissioner Manning said is unacceptable.
“The Highlands Highway is critical infrastructure, central to the welfare of communities across the region, particularly our SMEs moving their crops to market.
“Police are working closely with community Leaders to address grievances and together identify those who would cause harm.
“Communities have every right to air their concerns, however interrupting the highway is not the right way to do it.
“I have been briefed that families and communities involved have since presented a petition, and I am pleased to see community leaders step up and receive this petition.
“I expect community leaders to deliver on their duty. This means working with their communities, and with police, to ease tensions.”

Guinness happy with barracks project,28/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3377,"Accommodating members of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary continues to be a challenge nationwide. Assistant Commissioner of Police – Northern Command, Peter Guinness, during the quarterly Northern Command conference in Madang yesterday, stated that many unmarried police personnel are renting and it’s proven to be an expensive exercise, and more so contributes to their welfare issues.
ACP Guinness condemned negative public perceptions about the recently built barracks in Madang, constructed by Pacific AR Limited at a cost of K160,000.00. He said this project is a positive step towards alleviating accommodation challenges faced by RPNGC members in Madang, and addresses issues like low retention rates of police personnel in Madang. ACP Guinness said police personnel would leave the Madang Command after a short while because accommodation was always an issue.

Young Yabob woman stabbed to death,28/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3374,"Twenty-three-year-old Shammika Pantumari of Yabob village in Madang Province died tragically from a stab wound she sustained during a confrontation with a known attacker on the evening of Saturday 22nd February, 2025, on Bagbag Island.
The young woman was part of a singing group from Yabob that had travelled to Bagbag for a funeral ceremony, when she was killed. Her alleged killer is 24-year-old Salul Kiari from Suwit Village in Madang’s Rai Coast District. He has since been arrested and charged with willful murder. Police allege that Kiari was under the influence to drugs and alcohol when he stabbed the young woman.
Kiari was also part of the Yabob singing group that went to Bagbag. While Police are yet to properly establish his relationship to the victim, they were reliably informed that Kiari was questioning Pantumari about her whereabouts during the funeral ceremony before he stabbed her in the left rib with a kitchen knife. The deceased is the daughter of Senior Constable Joe Pantumari of the Madang police. Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim, described the incident as shocking.
“The incident happened so fast. Villagers saw her bleeding as she ran for help before collapsing,” Baim reported. He added that despite efforts to get her medical help, Pantumari was pronounced dead on arrival at a local health centre on the island.
Police are currently compiling evidence for his court appearance at the Madang District Court next week. Kiari remains in custody at Jomba Police Station in Madang town."

Preserving the Kumul,28/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3368,"At the heart of Papua New Guinea’s rich natural heritage lies its national bird, the Raggiana Bird of Paradise, or the 'Kumul'. This bird, with its vibrant plumage and symbolic presence on the nation’s flag, is more than a creature of beauty-it is a testament to the cultural and natural wealth of PNG.
In a groundbreaking achievement, the Port Moresby Nature Park has successfully bred the Raggiana Bird of Paradise for the second time in just four years. This rare accomplishment reflects years of meticulous effort by the Park’s wildlife team.
Acting Conservation Manager, Francis Otto Gundu said, “So here at Port Moresby Nature Park we have breeding programs for different species of animals especially the endangered species and even the protected ones. Breeding of the Bird of Paradise is one of our breeding programs. The successful breeding of this species of the Bird of Paradise is like a great achievement for the park and the country.”
Behind the scenes, the breeding process was a delicate balance of science and care.
Gundu said, ""There are certain challenges that we faced while hand raising the chicks. Some challenges we faced is we need some appropriate items like incubators in order to make the successful breeding of these chicks. Because sometimes when we have the bird of paradise laying their eggs in their natural homes and the fact that we allow animals to coexist, they destroy the eggs and there is no chance of breeding system.”
“Apart from equipment we will need more aviaries for breeding more Birds of Paradise species.
""The last time that we bred this species was four years ago so during the three years we have been working really hard to come to this stage of re-breeding these species. There are certain techniques and skills in mastering these enclosures, (and) diet we have been working on improving.
A significant part of the Park’s mission is the 'Lukautim Bilas Bilong Yu' campaign, which aims to protect the Raggiana Bird of Paradise while respecting PNG’s cultural heritage.
""This is one of the three campaigns that we have here in the park. The main objective is to make sure that we don't hunt. Like most Papua New Guineans, we use the feathers to make traditional costumes. But if we continue to hunt, the number of wild birds will decline and eventually, we will not see this beautiful species.
“So as much as possible we are trying to educate our general guests to look after their feathers. So, during our talks we normally introduce different ways the general public can look after their bilas and we even give them alternatives like dying chicken feathers.
“Imagine, it takes 27 feathers of a bird of paradise to make one headdress. So (if) we are trying to have traditional costumes, imagine the destruction we are going to cause to the wild population,” he added.
Beyond conservation, the Nature Park plays a crucial role in educating future generations and engaging the community. Through various visitor programs, it connects people with the local flora and fauna, helping to raise awareness about how native species are linked to traditions and customs.
Building on the hands-on dedication, the broader vision and global significance of the park’s achievements come into focus through the insights of CEO John Paul Houston, whose leadership underscores the collective effort behind this conservation success.
Houston said, “All birds of paradise are well known as one of the more complicated things to breed, so we’re incredibly proud of all of our keepers who have worked hard to gain these skills necessary and grow with the species we have here. Everybody is massively dedicated to what they do, all of the keeping staff and animal team, and all of the staff in general around the park, all pitch in in some way or other. So to watch people get one step closer every time from egg to hatching the chick to rearing the chick to now having birds flying around in aviaries it’s been a testament really to what the staff here can do.”
The park’s global impact is also a key highlight, with Houston noting how this success puts Papua New Guinea on the world stage.
He said, “We breed multiple species of bird here, working towards sustainable populations for the park to display for educational purposes for the thirty thousand plus school children in a year that come through. It puts us on a great standing with the world.”
“Conservation of species, sustainability, education in terms of climate change and biodiversity in PNG is an endless job. And so, we call to anyone who can help, please do help through the Corporate Social Responsibility or otherwise, we always need the support,” Houston remarked.
As Papua New Guinea is set to celebrate its 50th year of Independence, the successful breeding of the Raggiana Bird of Paradise symbolizes what can be achieved through passion, innovation, and collaboration. It reminds us that preserving our natural heritage is not just about protecting a species but safeguarding the soul of a nation."
Buin hospital breaks ground,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3367,"A groundbreaking ceremony for the new Buin District Hospital, held earlier this week was an important opportunity to celebrate Australia’s continued friendship with the people of Bougainville.
Australia was delighted to provide a K76 million grant to develop the new Buin District Hospital. When complete, the district hospital will be able to provide the following services:
• general outpatient,
• accident and emergency,
• maternal and child health,
• dental and surgical services,
• medical imaging and physiotherapy services
It also will include a Family Support Centre, a mortuary, and other facilities. The Hospital will serve a catchment population of approximately 50,000 people in South Bougainville, and will also support Solomon Islanders living on the Shortland Islands, who often travel to Buin for medical services given its proximity.
The new hospital will also contribute to a wider network of health facilities whose construction was supported by Australia in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville: Orami and Kodora community health posts in South Bougainville; Karato and Kakusida community health posts in Central Bougainville; and the new health centre being built at Soroken.
In providing funding for each of these health facilities, Australia ensures that these projects are buying supplies from and creating job opportunities for local communities, ensuring they receive not just health but wider economic benefits.
Australia is committed to supporting the health sector in Papua New Guinea. In the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, this also includes funding for routine immunisation for children, strengthening HIV services, and providing strategic support to the Bougainville Department of Health."
District gears up for 50th anniversary,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3366,"As the country gears to mark 50 years of independence – focusing on projects to better the lives of rural Papua New Guineas are important in marking this milestone.
The Ijivitari District Development Authority (IDDA) in Northern Province is gearing up for a bumper celebration with the opening of new projects, which are in progress.
Local MP, David Arore says the DDA intends to deliver projects to the people with a ribbon-cutting ceremony and launching by September. He said the projects are a token of appreciation and a show of strength as a local government in providing vital services for the people.
‘’This is what the Ijivitari iDDA intends to do during the 50th anniversary celebrations. We will travel to all the LLGs, starting from Afore, Safia and Tufi, to launch and deliver projects during the 50th anniversary,” Arore said.
“We started from ground zero, but the momentum is picking up and we are running 100 miles. Each LLG will have a reason to smile and celebrate the country’s 50th-anniversary celebrations when projects are delivered to them.”"
Ijivitari allocates K1.5million for vital services,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3365,"The Ijivitari District Development Authority has allocated K1.5 million to improve water and install electricity in the district.
While delivering on the revised budget for the 2025 fiscal year last week, local MP and Vice Minister for Finance, David Arore stressed the importance of having a proper water supply system and electricity in place for the rural population in the district.
He said Afore and Tufi are the two main local-level governments that require a proper water supply system to be set in place to benefit the rural population.
‘’We need our people to have access to proper water supply system. ‘’That is the main reason that the Ijivitari DDA has allocated these monies to utilize on these projects,’’ he said.
Tufi LLG president, Luke Nunisa while thanking the DDA for the initiative, said schools in Tufi need proper water supply systems for students to use.
“With the current education infrastructure taking place at Tufi, water is essential for students. Students must have access to proper drinking water and that is the great initiative taken up by the Ijivitari DDA under the leadership of chairman Mr Arore to prioritize the water supply system in the district,’’ Nunisa said.
Meantime, Arore added that the energy sector was another important sector that the DDA has taken on board. Electricity is planned to be rolled out to rural households, and importantly to schools and health centres.
The building contract was awarded to Glory Investment, a well-established Korean company specialized in providing water supply systems and energy (electricity) globally.
The contracted was approved by the Ijivitari district procurement committee."

Reflections on Sir Michael Somare,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3363,"“My reflections on Sir Michael (Somare) have always been admiration and gratitude.
“I admired his ability to relate to people from all walks of life and his ability to inspire people from our many tribes to be one nation.
“I am also grateful for the opportunities that he gave me even when opposed by other MPs and Parties.
“Ministries are usually allocated according to the number of MPs a Party brings to the coalition.
“In both 2002 and 2007, the Melanesian Alliance did not have enough members to warrant giving me a Ministry but he ignored the objections from other MPs and firmly told them that it was not negotiable and gave me the Ministry that I wanted.
“I am grateful for his confidence in me and for the opportunity that he gave me to make some significant policy and legislative reforms in the social sector.
“We are truly blessed as a nation to have had him as our founding father.

TKCP accommodates 3 wards in Nayudo,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3360,"Eighteen ward councilors from Morobe and Madang province are proud they have delivered draft development plans, setting the foundations of having their community development needs met. The Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program (TKCP), established in the Yus LLG of Kabwum District, Morobe Province, provided the technical support in drafting these ward plans, managing to include 3 wards in the Nayudo LLG of Rai Coast District, Madang Province.
In Morobe, they drafted 12 ward plans for Yus LLG in Kabwum and three ward plans for Wasu LLG in Tewae-Siassi. The 18 ward councillors had to undergo a week’s planning meeting in Lae to put together respective draft ward plans. TKCP facilitated the program under its Financial Literacy program. Funding for this workshop was provided by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, through its Biodiversity Protection and Management Area program.
TKCP partners with Yus LLG and its sister LLGs in Wasu and Nayudo. It promotes conservation efforts that includes the livelihood of local communities and basic development needs in education, health and socio-economic activities like coffee and cocoa projects.  TKCP facilitates land use planning, which is a key development tool that helps local stakeholders to better plan and manage their land and natural resources besides other development needs.
Modi Pontio, TKCP Associate Director was thrilled to meet with the councilors and witness their progress. She reminded the councilors that their integrated ward development plan has to be completed in their ward areas in close consultation with their ward development committees, effecting the theme of ‘Strengthening Community-Based governance and management for Papua New Guinea’s Yus Conservation Area’. She added that service delivery and infrastructure is not part of TKCP’s program priorities, hence the ward development plan in draft will assist to cater for these.
Meantime, Tewae Siassi District Administrator Sam Engam emphasized that partnership and proper consultation with the government is crucial in all of this planning.
In support this government and NGO partnership, Nayudo LLG president, Senuka Kaku, pledged K15, 000 to the Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program to support the development of community-based organizations, including the 3 wards of Upper Nankina in Nayudo and into the Yus Conservation Area."
Madang Council of Women elects new president,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3358,"Theresa Kamau Kas, wife of former Madang Governor Jim Kas is the new president of the Madang Provincial Council of Women following her successful election on Wednesday (February 26th).
The other council executives elected include Beverly Peniel from Raicoast as Treasurer, Jessica Morosa from Sumkar as Secretary and Victoria Jano from Bogia as Vice President.
The women thanked the provincial electoral office for successfully coordinating their elections, and ensuring Madang women are represented in the Council of Women.
The women acknowledged the support of the provincial Electoral Commission in hosting coordinated elections in a bottom-up approach, starting from each ward, the local level government, districts, and finally to have the provincial election completed.
The Middle Ramu missed out on the election, as logistics could not allow for its inclusion and also due to its geographical location. However, they have coordinated their elections which will be updated once data is received. Most of the elections conducted in the five districts were qualified by a 50 percent plus 1 or 2 method due to remoteness, meaning so long as 50 percent or more of wards or LLGs present.
The 20 women elected were given an awareness of the background of the Council of Women and of how voting was to be conducted as many were new to the council that were elected. The voting system used was first past the post.
In her official speech, Mrs Kas did not waste time but made her intentions known as president of the Madang Council of Women to compete in the National Council of Women for the presidency seat.
“I’m not just standing up as President for Madang but I intend to contend the National Council of Women president seat as well. For far too long our issues have not been addressed, and I’m ready to put my hands up,” Mrs. Kas stated.
The women once taking office highlighted crucial pointers to raise internally, and also plan to attend the Women’s Convention in Kavieng from the 23rd – 28th of March, to coincide with International Women’s Day."

Woman injured in self-defense,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3348,"A young woman in Port Moresby almost lost her fingers whilst defending herself as a knife-wielding thug swung at her in an attempt to rob her.
Eunice Kanamabae in recounting her ordeal encouraged residents, especially females of Port Moresby to be vigilant and to prioritize their lives over belongings when they are confronted by thugs.
It was a normal morning for Eunice Kanamabae as she stepped out of her house at Hohola on Sunday, 23rd February. She was confronted by a thug and it all happened so fast and she is appalled at how this all happened within her neighborhood.
“I was waiting for my work pick-up at Hohola, as I took out my phone to message my driver. This young man approached me and removed a knife whilst asking for my belongings. I stood up and he swung the knife. I blocked myself and he cut my fingers. I ran towards a group of men (who didn’t see what happened) and they managed to chase him, however, he got away.”
Fortunately, Eunice works for Glorious Medical Centre and was able to get urgent medical attention. She regrettably recounted how she should have acted differently to avoid getting her fingers cut.
“I regret taking my phone out in public, I should have stayed at home and alerted the driver and I also should have given him the phone. But I was in panic mode and the things I thought I should have done, didn’t come to mind.”
Eunice went on social media to tell her story and advised young women in the city to take precautions and be on alert when in public.
“Port Moresby is no longer safe, especially for women who are walking around alone and I urged that women should take extra precautions and be safe. When the incident happened, I screamed and was able to alert other people around me. But if you are alone and there is no one around you just give in and give your belongings to these thugs, your life is more important, I could have lost my fingers just because of my phone.”
Now, Eunice is awaiting a medical report to take the matter to the police station for further investigations. She has a clear depiction of the young man and says she won’t back down until the young man is behind bars.
“I think the Government should look at these petty crimes because it’s the petty crimes that lead to big crimes. The government should look at solutions to minimize the crime rates in the city. Maybe provide more job opportunities to the youths living in those areas to watch the neighborhood or bus stop wardens. I think that’s a good initiative and they should carry that out more often.”"
MP dissatisfied with provincial budget,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3345,"Some MPs of Morobe Province were absent during Monday’s (Feb 24) budget session at Tutumang Haus to show their dissatisfaction.
Markham MP and Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Koni Iguan, outlined this after the Morobe Governor and provincial finance chairman, Luther Wenge, presented an expenditure budget of K723.96 million for this year.
“In the morning, I checked some of them and they gave their apologies for not attending as they are away, while others expressed their frustration, saying they do not want to attend the budget meeting because they believe that their districts are missing out in the provincial budget,” said Iguan.
“They are saying, what is the purpose of us attending and debating when we don’t get anything, and we don’t see anything in our districts from the provincial budget. So, the only thing to do is to abstain.
“I told them that I also want to abstain but I need to attend and speak my mind.”
Iguan thanked the Governor and budget committee for delivering the budget and noted that Zumara Primary School in his electorate has been listed as an impact project under the ‘infrastructure development grant’.
“It’s listed there but I don’t know how much is being allocated. I’m looking for Markham’s portion here but maybe I’ll go back and have a good look.
“Have you seen the condition of the Wantoat road? A lot of our people have died from vehicle accidents there. Never at one time has this provincial government allocated funding for the Leron-Wantoat Road.
“My district services improvement program (DSIP) funds are insufficient. I truly thought I would get a share of this pig,” he figuratively stressed.
“I will invite the provincial budget team including you, the governor, as the chairman, to my district development authority meeting.
“There’s no consultation in this budget,” he fired at the Provincial Executive Council.
He further debated Governor Wenge’s description of the IDG as “shadow money” that was enveloped in “a lot of controversies”.
“Tie it up with projects and name it in the budget. Don’t put it as ‘shadow’ because once it stays as shadow, it will be at anybody’s discretion. We might not know where that money is going.
“We cannot blame the governor. Those in the administration, are you aware of Markham’s challenges?”
He outlined that he and the Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, had already pledged a 4-in-1 classroom for Zumara Primary School while the Markham DDA will construct a teacher’s house. MPG’s allocation of a double classroom was not welcomed by the MP.
“If there had been consultation, we would have allocated that money to other schools that are in dire need of support.”"
Call for more classrooms in schools,26/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3343,"Tusbab Secondary in Madang Province faced challenges during the start of the 2025 academic year, due to lack of classrooms to cater for grade 9 students.
Recently the school authority and provincial education board were faced by disgruntled parents whose children were eligible to do grade 9 but were turned down due to limited space. This called for more school facilities, importantly classrooms.
The disgruntled parents were students from Tusbab’s feeder schools - Kusbau, Gum and Jomba primary schools, who believed their children should be prioritised.
With a growing number of grade 8 students coming out of primary schools in Madang, Tusbab when school resumed prioritised students who had achieved higher pass marks.
Tusbab deputy principal - administration Michael Camillus Kavagu said, “The cut-off criterion was 63 percent but unfortunately, students who did well over 70 percent were given priority and accepted.
This issue was escalated to the Acting Education director, Alphonse Igag to pursue the matter with Town Mayor Peter Yalsy to accommodate more classrooms. Over two weeks, Mr. Yalsy and the Tusbab administration sought avenues and accommodated two more classrooms. Today the unaccounted-for students are in class.
The school principal said, “Most times, it is the grade nines that require extra attention at the beginning of the year, mostly about selection and spacing.
He said roughly there are 500 students in grade 9 and with the inclusion of two new classes, there are eight grade nine classes – this is about 60 students in each class.
“With free education, the number of students graduating out of grade eight increases every year; and the call for infrastructural development in terms of classrooms remains.”

Rabaul roads upgraded,26/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3340,"Rabaul district, in East New Britain Province, is currently rolling out major road rehabilitation in some of its main roads in the district.
The roads that are currently being maintained include Blanche Bay Rd, Second 22nd Street along the Page Park Market, Bay Rd, and the historic Tunnel Hill Rd.
When giving a brief on the status of the infrastructure projects in Rabaul district, the acting District Administrator, Freddy Lemeki, said these projects were approved last year through the Provincial Procurement Committee, and work has started for most.
He outlined that these impact projects are important for fostering economic development and enhancing tourism.
“The Blanche Road along the beach front is a vital economic road that connects our sea ports with the market and business houses; it links our supply food chain. Not only does it connect us to the wharves but it is also the gateway to our cruise ships berthing,” said Lemeki.
He further thanked the contractor, Nivani Ltd, for completing phase 1 of the Blanche Road rehabilitation project, and also commended the Provincial Government for co-funding it.
Phase 2 of the project has started with the clearance of silt underway.
Meantime, Rabaul district roads supervisor, Jude Gigiala, also gave a brief on the status of the Tunnel Hill Road, outlining that this stretch of the road has been deteriorating over the years.
The project was awarded to Nivani Ltd last year for K2.2 million under the infrastructure development program and is 33 percent complete.
He said this is another historical and tourism road that leads up to the Haus Guria or Volcano Observatory, and also the Nonga Base Provincial Hospital.
“This project starts from Rabaul Police Station (Checkpoint) and goes down to Toleap Junction towards the Nonga Road, which is about 2.3km and so far, Nivani Ltd is doing drainage works and edge beams repairs,” said Gigiala.
He added that 2,000m of edge beams along the road have been constructed and after that, they would do pavement repairs and then sealing of the road.
The district roads supervisor further said they will also continue with emergency road works and attending to resettlement roads as part of their programs this year."
Change looming in NCD Police,26/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3339,"The NCD Police is expected to make major changes within the zone command, a move to address the escalating law and order issue and instill police discipline.
The change is imminent with the three zone commanders to be replaced with just one commander, says Assistant Commissioner of Police for NCD/ Central, Benjamin Turi.
He said these changes are necessary to address some issues that were brought to his attention.
When speaking to the media on Tuesday, Turi said law and order issues are escalating in the city with many investigations from years still pending and not completed on time and to the expectation of the force.
He said many members of the force have also been involved in certain crimes committed and blamed the lack of management by the three-zone commanders.
Turi said zone commanders are not performing to expectations, leading to negligence and complacency issues in the force.
Therefore, Turi has taken an approach to do away with the three-zone commanders and appoint one commander who will oversee all operations. This is to maintain command and control in the force.
“I am removing people who are weak without no strength of character to lead and discipline people in the command,” he said.
Turi said cutting down on police hire cars is another action that will be implemented to ensure fuel is preserved and used for operations purposes. This year, all police hire cars will be removed in both the NCD and Central Command.
ACP Turi said police officers are warned to make five arrests in a day and submit their report. Those who do not make an arrest will be given a warning to find another job or move out from the force. This approach is taken to ensure police officers are working."

Whilst addressing the media, Marape gave a brief report on his meeting with the Governor General of Australia, Samantha Mostyn in Sydney as well as other visits.
The Prime Minister also visited the Australian Museum, National Library of Australia, and National Archives of Australia.
His visit highlighted the profound and enduring relationship between the two nations, particularly as Papua New Guinea prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary of independence this year.
PM Marape expressed deep appreciation for Australia’s historical ties with Papua New Guinea following his visit.
“I was greatly moved by the historical collections preserved in these Australian institutions, which capture the depth of our shared past.
“These archives reflect the many chapters of our journey- from the early colonial days, through World War I and II, the Australian administration, and finally to our independence in 1975.
“They offer an important window into our identity as a nation and our long-standing relationship with Australia,” Marape said.

These archives hold invaluable records that trace Papua New Guinea’s journey from colonial administration to independence in 1975, shedding light on the deep bond between the two countries.
One significant moment that captured the Prime Minister’s attention was the 4,000-year-old Ambum stone found in the Australian Museum.
He further expressed his gratitude for Australia’s ongoing commitment to supporting PNG’s independence celebrations, noting the significance of Australian institutions dedicating spaces to commemorate Papua New Guinea’s 50th anniversary of independence."
PNG highlights commitment to ENBi,26/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3335,"Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources, Jelta Wong, this week addressed the gathering of Pacific Island Leaders on the East New Britain Initiative (ENBi) during the Honiara Summit on Sustainable Fisheries.
He emphasised the vision behind ENBi as a collaborative platform aimed at enhancing coordination and cooperation among Pacific Island countries to advance shared aspirations for sustainable tuna fisheries development.
In the first quarter of 2024, PNG committed to the success of ENBi through the allocation of over K1.8 million (US$500,000) to the Forum Fisheries Agency to fund the ENBi program and activities, recognizing the potential it holds for all Pacific countries.
ENBi ENBi not only focuses on hubs and spokes and the retention of tuna value in the region but also on the establishment of a Regional Fisheries Development Fund, which will benefit all Pacific Island nations.
“I am pleased to note that progress has been made to begin this work, with the support of our development partner, the European Union. I encourage the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) to work jointly with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in formulating the Regional Fisheries Development Fund,” Minister Wong said.
“When discussing the retention of value from our region’s tuna catches, we are reminded of the many challenges facing Pacific Island nations,” he added.
“These challenges include inadequate infrastructure, unreliable utilities, high operational costs, limited skilled labor, and geographical remoteness from major markets.”
“These challenges will persist if we continue to operate independently, with each Pacific country pursuing tuna fishing and processing investments in isolation. ENBi seeks to shift this paradigm by promoting regional collaboration and leveraging our collective strengths.”
Minister Wong emphasized that stakeholders recognize the immense value Pacific nations bring as custodians of some of the world’s best-managed tuna resources. ENBi serves as a platform for Pacific Island countries to identify strategic entry points, form alliances, and actively participate in commercial tuna ventures and supporting industries.
“The essence of our Pacific way of life is at stake if we allow ourselves to be controlled by external forces dictating global prices,” Minister Wong added.
“We are the rightful stewards of our resources.  We must unite as a cohesive region, rather than allowing ourselves to be picked off one by one. We must cultivate a narrative that reflects our collective identity, with ENBi as our vital connection.”
Minister Wong is hopeful that one day the ENBi logo will be on canned tuna products, signaling to customers that the benefits derived from the catch, processing, and sale of these products are shared by multiple Pacific Island countries. To realize this, all Pacific nations must work with eco-label organizations and internationally recognized NGOs to amplify their message.
“Papua New Guinea aims to position itself as a regional tuna processing hub, similar to several other Pacific countries. PNG operates six processing plants, with a combined designed daily processing capacity of over 1,000 metric tonnes,” said Minister Wong.
“While this is an achievement, we recognize the need for continued improvement, particularly in implementing policies that support investment, industry expansion, and operational efficiency.”
“We are working on securing fiscal incentives and developing Fisheries Special Economic Zones to attract investment from other Pacific countries and their respective partners. I know we’ve been discussing this for over a decade, but I am confident that ENBi can be the catalyst, and the participation of other countries can be the key to finally realizing this concept.”
In closing, Minister Wong highlighted that “ENBi has received strong endorsement from FFC Ministers and Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, reflecting its significance for our region.”
“I therefore urge each of us to actively engage with ENBi’s initiatives and collaborate with your colleagues and the ENBi Working Group. As Gandhi famously said, all good thoughts and ideas mean nothing without action.”
“Together, we can realize the vision of maximizing the value of our region’s tuna resources for the benefit of all Pacific nations. Our Pacific Islands Forum family represents 18 Large Ocean States, each with dreams and aspirations for economic empowerment. These 18 large Ocean states represent over 10 percent of the UN family.”
He concluded by quoting the Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum, Baron Waqa, “We are at the center of strategic geopolitical interest. We own the strategic potential of our collective, and together, we reaffirm that we act from a position of strength. We must not forget this.”"

Marape challenges Nomane to outline his district achievements,25/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3327,"Prime Minister James Marape has issued a direct challenge to the Member for Chuave, James Nomane, calling on him to show the people of Chuave and Papua New Guinea what he has achieved with the funds allocated to his district.
The Prime Minister made this challenge after Nomane issued a statement calling on him to show cause on what the Government has done in addressing the law and order issues in the country rather than boasting about the inclusion of a NRL Team.
“I challenge Mr Nomane to show the people of Chuave and Papua New Guinea what he has achieved with the funds allocated to his district.
Leadership is about action and delivering results, not just rhetoric. The people of Chuave deserve to see tangible developments, not just political grandstanding,” said Prime Minister Marape.
“The Member for Chuave seems to believe we are a single-task government, but I must educate him that we are a multi-tasking government achieving far more than he could accomplish in five years.
“NRL is just one of many initiatives we are delivering for PNG.
As I reflect on our achievements while enroute to my next engagement, I recall just a few of the many developments we have undertaken.”

“I could list many more, but time does not permit,” said Prime Minister Marape.
“Challenges remain, but our government is actively addressing them rather than merely complaining and bickering, as some opposition members prefer to do.
“While Mr Nomane talks about rugby league, my government is delivering development across all sectors, including a record K15 million development funds for every district in 2024, including Chuave. I hope he is effectively using the K50 million he has received so far for the benefit of his constituents, rather than just engaging in media commentary.”
“Leadership is about action and context, not just criticism. I urge all young leaders to engage in meaningful service to their electorates while advocating for their positions,” Marape said."
Forensic investigation into Baruni murder continue,25/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3325,"DNA samples and related evidence have been secured by Police Forensic experts following the arrest of three persons in connection with the murder of a 23-year-old woman in Baruni on Saturday, 15 February 2025.
The investigative breakthrough follows the appointment of two medical professionals as the Royal PNG Constabulary Special Constables, ensuring that critical DNA evidence can be obtained promptly and professionally.
Commissioner of Police, David Manning, confirmed the identification and collection of advanced forensic evidence was supported by specialist forensic advisory support from the Australian Federal Police.
""I am pleased to see the responsive support of the AFP in this matter, with experienced forensics officers providing on-the-shoulder advice and mentoring to RPNGC Specialists, Commissioner Manning said.
""This vulgar crime tears at the fabric of our society. It is right that we put every available resource into ensuring every criminal involved in this terrible offence spends the rest of his life behind bars. Our investment in advanced forensics means we are now able to secure and present irrefutable forensics evidence to be used in court to secure convictions,"" he said.
The breakthrough in forensics investigations follows the identification of a previously unknown offender during training of a digital fingerprint identification system. The application of a new digital fingerprint identification system identified a latent fingerprint from a historical stolen motor vehicle. This correlated with fingerprints recently obtained from the crime scene.
Commissioner Manning confirmed that while not highly-publicised, significant advances in forensics capabilities are being made in partnership with the support of regional policing partners.
""This is an area of policing where outcomes speak for themselves. Forensics evidence is critical in modern policing, and our forensics experts are now identifying criminals from fingerprints and DNA.""
""Fingerprints and DNA offer irrefutable evidence. Our investments in these capabilities are ensuring that those responsible for violent crimes are charged, tried in the Court, and sent to jail,"" Manning added."
Villagers appeal for police presence,25/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3324,"The people of Ainong, in the remote Simbai Local Level Government (LLG) of Middle Ramu, are appealing for police presence after their village was allegedly raided and destroyed by armed men.
The group of men, numbering at over 20, descended on the ward one village at around 10.30pm on Wednesday, November 14th, 2024, and chased residents, looted 21 homes, and burnt 14 to the ground.
While it has been three months since the incident, the ward one residents of Simbai LLG, in Madang Province, are unable to return and rebuild their homes as the group of armed men, from Womuk village, are still threatening them.
Currently, over 200 men, women and children have been displaced, and are seeking refuge at the Anglican Church.
Kovon community leader, Morrison Wiam, reached out to this newsroom on behalf of the displaced community, stressing that the community is living in fear.
He believes that the attack was in retaliation to the community reporting them for producing homebrew, gambling and disrupting the community, especially during a coffee show that was hosted on November 2nd, 2024.
“During that time, we saw drunkards chasing people so we reported to Madang police, including the Middle Ramu District Development Authority,” Wiam said.
“On November 4th, 2024, three policemen from Madang arrived with the District Administrator, Middle Ramu, Sucklyn Gi.
“The team were there in the early hours and ordered out the producers and suppliers of drugs and homebrew with their equipment. And at the same time, drunkards were also demanded by police to surrender.
“Locals were told to identify the suspects, who surrendered only a portion of their homebrew production equipment.
“The destruction was made 12 days later, after the three policemen left for Madang under a district chartered helicopter with Middle Ramu’s district administrator.”
Simbai is an inaccesible part of Madang that has no police station, no police personnel and no road connection.
The people are isolated and left to fend for themselves.
“We are appealing to our elected leaders, especially Member for Middle Ramu district and Governor of Madang, to work along with our village court officials and community leaders to deploy more manpower to strengthen law and order and make Ainong and Middle Ramu district a safer place,” said Wiam."

Although a small mine, SGCL continues to have a significant impact on the communities of Simberi Island and the Tabar Group of Islands in terms of providing employment opportunities and sustainable development through ongoing projects."
The sad state of Braun hospital,24/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3315,"It doesn’t matter how far they have travelled to access medical assistance; all patients at the Braun Memorial District Hospital are expected to find their firewood and cook their own meals.
The Braun Memorial District Hospital, run by Lutheran Health Services, is located on the southern side of the Mape River, in the Finschhafen district of Morobe Province.
It was initially constructed as the Butaweng Chest Hospital in 1958 – treating TB patients from all over Papua New Guinea – then upgraded to a health centre in 1974 when it was merged with an old World War II hospital called Buangi.
In 2011, the hospital had a national doctor, three expatriate doctors, 17 nurses and 25 community health workers (CHWs) serving the catchment areas of Finschhafen, Siassi and Kabwum.
Today, only a skeletal staff is on the ground; one national doctor serving over 30 patients a day, no health extension officer, and just a handful of nurses.
There is no running water, with patients – including mothers who have just delivered babies – forced to make the 5-7-minute walk to the nearby Butaweng Falls. Security is a major issue, with just 2 guards manning the gates on an ad hoc basis and no proper fencing. Patients and staff get robbed regularly; including those who walk to Butaweng to bathe.
Jelin Iveloks is from the mountain area of Pindiu, in the Hube Rural LLG. She has been at the hospital for 2 weeks now with two of her children and her teen niece, who has not enrolled in school but is taking care of her as her guardian. The teenager chops their firewood, prepares their meals and cooks for them, aside from washing their clothes and taking care of the children.
“We brought our own firewood from the village and are cooking our food,” she shared while struggling to hold her youngest son, a restless 2-year-old. “We have some relatives who live at Kiregen who bring the firewood to the boat landing at DCA, then we collect it and bring it up.”
The boat landing is at least a 5-minute drive to Gagidu Station, then it would take another 20 minutes to drive to Braun hospital.
“We live in the bush, on the border of Kabwum and Finschhafen. We’re right in the bushes; no roads for vehicles and our school is neglected so our children do not go to school.”
Jessica Sirip, who hails from the nearby Kolem village and Manus, was cooking with other women at the brick ‘haus kuk’.
“Patients at Butaweng have to provide everything. When it comes to firewood, those of us living nearby are ok, compared to our people from the mountains, who have to shoulder the burden. They have to bring everything; firewood, food, money, anything that is needed to survive here. The hospital also doesn’t have a proper mess to eat in, and our fathers and mothers, especially those with severe illnesses, are made to suffer even more.”
The last time the hospital had running water was in 2022. Since then, life has been difficult for staff, patients and students at the Braun Community Health Worker Training School.
It is hoped that the relevant authorities, including the district and Lutheran Health Services, can look into renovating the rundown infrastructure, boosting security at the hospital, installing a new water supply system, restocking their wards with much-needed medical equipment and look at lighting issues as well."
KPHL starts shooting seismic in Gulf Province,24/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3313,"Kumul Petroleum Holdings Ltd has this month started gathering seismic data in its Barikewa petroleum retention licence in the Gulf Province.
Kumul Petroleum Managing Director, Wapu Sonk said its contractor, OilMin Holdings Limited, has for the last few months engaged with landowners, building camps, helipads and bridging, drilling holes for explosive charges, and laying out the recorders over approximately 80 kilometres in six seismic lines in two licences, and this week we have started data collection.
Mr Sonk explained that this was a historic moment - the first time a 100 percent national company had engaged in petroleum appraisal work in the country. The seismic work would gather additional information on gas already discovered in the two KPHL licences, to increase known volumes of oil and gas they contain, and improve targets for possible further drilling.
“From seismic results from the Barikewa field, and later in the Kimu field, we will have a better idea of the oil and gas volumes in these licences and be able to assess the economic feasibility of monetising the gas, and select a development path.”
Mr Sonk explained that the seismic work was in a remote area and helicopter-supported; that line cutting was a labour-intensive activity and the OilMin managed operation employed more than 300 local casual employees.
He noted that OilMin and Kumul Petroleum were also involved in small scale community development in communities close to the seismic work activities.
Mr Sonk explained further, “KPHL’s role is to maximise the financial returns that PNG receives from the natural resources it has been blessed with, supporting our economy and development as a country.”
“Now Kumul Petroleum Holdings is actively involved in upstream petroleum appraisal we can progress further commercialisation of PNG’s gas resources, in licences where these discoveries had previously been considered uneconomic and ‘stranded’ fields.”"
NBPOL showcases growth and sustainability,23/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3305,"New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) has reaffirmed its commitment to the sustainable growth of Papua New Guinea’s palm oil industry during a high-level visit by the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC) delegation on Thursday, February 20, 2025.
NBPOL’s Chief Operating Officer (COO), Nik Maziah Nik Mustapha, presented an overview of the company’s operations and strategic direction to CPOPC Secretary General Dr. Rizal Affandi Lukman and other officials at the company’s headquarters in Mosa, West New Britain.
The visit comes as PNG formally became the fourth member of CPOPC on December 1, 2024, after a four-year wait. “Congratulations to the Papua New Guinea government, and we are very, very happy to be part of the palm oil industry for Papua New Guinea and contributing as well to CPOPC,” Nik Maziah said.
NBPOL, a subsidiary of SD Guthrie (formerly Sime Darby Plantation), operates across multiple provinces in PNG and the Solomon Islands. Nik Maziah emphasised the company’s adherence to sustainability standards, noting that “NBPOL is the only operation that has got 100 percent fully certified oil” under the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).
She highlighted that PNG’s oil palm sector is vital to economic development, supporting local employment and smallholder farmers. “Every fortnight… the kind of money that’s being churned out and traded after our pay week is significant to the economy of West New Britain and also to the other provinces that we operate in,” she said.
However, aging palm trees pose a major challenge for production. “Easily, 80% of our outgrowers’ palms are already above the age of 19, and 29% are more than 25 years old,” she said. She stressed the urgent need for replanting programmes and financial support for smallholder farmers, warning that “our CPO volume has been on a decreasing trend because of less productive farms contributing to our mills.”
With PNG now part of CPOPC, the country joins Malaysia, Indonesia, and Honduras in representing 84 percent of the world’s crude palm oil (CPO) production. “With including the observing countries, another four, it’s 88.9 percent,” Nik Maziah stated, reinforcing PNG’s position as a key player in the global market.
However, international trade barriers remain a concern. “The global palm oil industry is under scrutiny… and it should be a win-win situation where a country is expected to preserve its nature, then some other country who’s benefiting must pay for these carbon credits,” she said, about increasing environmental regulations on palm oil exports.
She also underscored the need for PNG to establish its palm oil certification system, similar to Malaysia’s MSPO and Indonesia’s ISPO. “If PNG can have its certification, it will be able to sustain itself to the larger markets outside of just Europe,” she said."
Watermark Estate residents meet to address security issues,23/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3304,"Residents of Watermark Estate in Port Moresby are concerned about their safety following the brutal murder of Magaret Gabriel on February 15th.
In a press conference held at the estate this afternoon, the residents called for an urgent intervention from the authorities to investigate the incident, apprehend those involved, and restore normalcy.
Spokesperson Dermott Bagasel recommended that a police post must be established at the estate to protect the community and deal with issues that are raised not only in the estate but surrounding communities as well.
Bagasel said another recommendation is to establish a community watch and partner with the police to recruit some of the residents to train as Police reservists.
He said establishing proper fencing and creating one gate entry are some of the interventions they are planning to implement.
“We will put our petition before Governor Powes Parkop and work with police to implement some of these recommendations,” Bagasel said.
Meanwhile, the residents will establish a committee to address community issues."
Badili police rescue woman from thugs,23/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3301,"Quick response from Badili Police officers and other support units prevented a woman from being harmed after a group of men dragged her from the Two-Mile Hill bus stop to the settlement on Saturday morning.
Police were notified by the public through the phone that a woman was dragged into the settlement by a group of men.
Officers on duty broadcasted the incident via the police radio and immediately responded and rescued the woman. However, the suspects escaped.
Commander NCD and Central Province Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi was pleased with the fast response from the police.
Turi said this issue reminds the public about the importance of knowing the police officers who are stationed in their electorate or suburb.
He called on the community to help police identify the suspects for police to apprehend them.
""Our mothers, daughters, and girls had been victims of such, and I am calling on everyone to help report such if they see it happening. If we don't report, we will later regret it when the victim got raped or killed. It's best to report it when the incident is about to happen. On that, I want to once again thank those who were involved in saving the female at Two Mile Hill, Commander Turi said.
Commander Turi also thanked the Koki Community Policing members who assisted the Badili units. He said they had been very supportive in their area of operation.
Turi warned the settlers that if issues such as rape and killing continue to escalate in their area, may result in demolishing of their properties."

Defence Chief directs payroll cleanup,23/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3297,"Chief of Defence Force Rear Admiral Philip Polewara has directed for 110 names to be removed from the force’s payroll.
The names are of personnel who are on official records as AWOL (Absent without leave), deceased or discharged; but whose names are still on the PNGDF payroll and are still receiving fortnightly salaries from the government.
“Those names will be deleted from the system and payments effectively ceased,” Rear Admiral Polewara said.
This payroll anomaly came to light during the course of investigations into the PNGDF payroll; an exercise that has continued since last year following pay discrepancies experienced by members of the force.
Rear Admiral Polewara said more issues in the payroll would come to light and would be resolved as the work on the pay system progresses.
“Service Personnel Payroll is an important aspect of the force’s management that involves counterparts from the Public Service, especially the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance. Hence, PNGDF is working accordingly with the departments to ensure these matters are addressed,” Rear Admiral Polewara said.
“Other payroll issues identified during the course of the investigations will be addressed unit by unit through the commanding officers. Furthermore, should any member of the force be found intentionally allowing ghost names to be on the payroll, they will be severely dealt with.”
Meanwhile, the Chief of Defence Force stated that there will no longer be any re-enlistments.
“PNGDF will now strictly bring in personnel through the recruitment process and will no longer entertain re-enlistment of former members who expresses interest to come back,” he said.
“If directorates and units identify that there is a need for a specialist, they will follow due process so that PNGDF will write to the particular person offering a slot in the force.”
Rear Admiral Polewara said recruitment and personnel management was a focus area of the PNGDF because it was the process through which a quality defence force could be built on.
“I am very intentional in bringing in quality people and looking after them so that they can contribute to building a defence force that we as leaders dream of for a stronger future and a force our people deserve,” he said."
K12.5 Million Education Resource Center Nears Completion,22/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3296,"The construction of a K12.5 million three-story education resource center in the Eastern Highlands Province is progressing well and is set for completion by mid-2025. This landmark project, funded by the Eastern Highlands Provincial Government, is expected to transform the delivery of education services in the province.
Last week, Eastern Highlands Provincial Education Director Wesley Albert led a team of senior education officers on their first visit to the site of the new complex. The officers, including Fay Kaimavo (OIC Salaries), Richard Fino (PEB Executive Officer), and Meroyn Sero (OIC EMIS), expressed their appreciation for the infrastructure, describing it as a game-changer for the province's education sector.
“For the first time, the Eastern Highlands Education Division will have its own dedicated building to house all education-related services under one roof,” said one senior officer. ""This is a tangible change in education service delivery, and we thank our director for his leadership.""
Since taking office in 2019, Wesley Albert has overseen numerous improvements in the education sector, including policy implementation, administrative reforms, and infrastructural development. The new education resource center stands as a testament to these advancements.
Director Albert highlighted that this will be the first education building of its kind, not only in Eastern Highlands but across the country.
""You will not see such a building in other provinces. Eastern Highlands is privileged to have this magnificent three-story complex, which will be a one-stop shop for all education services,"" Albert said.
The facility will house key education divisions, including school inspectors, salaries, appointments, TVET, elementary education, district education managers (DEMs), and other sections. Additionally, it will feature a provincial FORD office, an e-library, e-learning facilities, college and university centers, an internet café, ATMs, a cafeteria, and rental office spaces for SMEs.
""This building will not only improve education service delivery but also contribute to the province's internal revenue by leasing office spaces to local businesses,"" Albert added.
Albert extended his gratitude to former Provincial Governor Peter Numu for initiating the project and acknowledged the continuous support from current Governor Simon Sia. He also thanked Provincial Administrator Allan Los and his administration for ensuring the project's timely implementation.
Once completed, the building will be a significant landmark in the heart of Goroka. The state-of-the-art structure will be fitted with modern electronic systems and offer breathtaking views of the province. From the top floor, visitors will have a panoramic view of Goroka’s central business district, the airport runway to the south, and the bustling Goroka main market to the west."
Adventure Kokoda and TPA Clash Over Management Plans,22/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3295,"The Papua New Guinea Tourism Promotion Authority (TPA) and Adventure Kokoda’s Charlie Lyn are at odds over the future of tourism along the historic Kokoda Trail, following recent claims about governance and development projects.
Lyn, a long-time operator on the trail, has criticized TPA CEO Eric Mossman-Uvovo, accusing him of signing a ""suicide note"" for Kokoda tourism by supporting the establishment of the Kokoda Track Management Authority (KTMA). He alleges the proposal, drafted in Canberra during the COVID-19 pandemic, lacks proper consultation with local landowners and tour operators.
According to Lyn, shifting Kokoda’s management focus from tourism to environmental oversight will burden the industry with regulations that limit trek group sizes, reduce campsite availability, and restrict access to key areas. He argues this move will further harm Kokoda tourism, which has already seen a 42% decline since 2009, translating to millions in lost revenue for local communities.
TPA has strongly refuted these claims, stating that its recent Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with ABT Associates, signed at Owers Corner in early February, is part of a broader initiative to improve infrastructure and support tourism. The agreement, under the Kokoda Initiative Partnership (KIP), aims to build 190 new toilets at campsites and guesthouses along the trail, enhancing sanitary conditions for trekkers and benefiting local communities.
Mossman-Uvovo dismissed allegations of a “secretly drafted” KTMA proposal, emphasizing that TPA has engaged stakeholders through consultations. He clarified that the MOA does not transfer tourism oversight to environmental agencies but instead strengthens tourism-related businesses along the trail.
“The claim that PNG is ‘giving away’ the Kokoda Trail to foreign aid-funded influencers is misleading,” Mossman-Uvovo stated. “TPA remains committed to growing and protecting PNG’s tourism industry while ensuring sustainable development that benefits landowners and tour operators.”
TPA reassured the public and stakeholders that all tourism developments along the Kokoda Track are undertaken transparently and in line with PNG’s national tourism strategy. Mossman-Uvovo encouraged open dialogue, emphasizing that any future decisions regarding the trail will align with national interests.
As the debate continues, the future of the Kokoda Trail remains a critical issue, with both sides pushing for what they believe best serves the interests of PNG tourism and local communities."
ITI degree program of international standard,22/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3294,"Certified Practicing Accountants PNG (CPAPNG) recognizes International Training Institute as a school that can produce accountants of international standard. This was revealed during the launch of ITI’s Bachelor in Accounting and Finance program yesterday in Port Moresby.
Manager for Continued Professional Development Trainings and Branding with the Certified Practicing Accountants, John Varey, said that the capacity of higher education to accommodate the growing needs and population of students remains a significant challenge for the country.
Over 70,000 students graduate from secondary schools in PNG and only 12 percent of these students’ secure space in tertiary institutions.
“This is where private institutions like ITI have been exceptional in addressing this gap and making substantial contribution to nation building.
“This is a testament to the program's quality and its alignment with global accounting education standards. CPA has been admitted to International Federation of accountant that's a global body based in New York, they set the standards for the global accounting fraternity to adopt.”
Varey also shared the CPA’s Executive Director, Yuwak Tau’s reaction to ITI’s degree program.
“When the proposed scope for Bachelor of Accounting and Finance program was presented for review, Mr Yuwak Tau, our executive director, was extremely pleased to see that the program not only met, but exceeded the standards set by International Federation of Accountants Education Board.”"
Mendi-Munihu DDA Ends Tertiary School Fee Assistance,22/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3292,"The Mendi-Munihu District Development Authority (MMDDA) has officially announced that it will no longer provide school fee assistance for students attending tertiary institutions in the 2025 academic year. The decision, made during a recent meeting, aims to shift the district’s focus toward improving basic education infrastructure.
Local MP and Vice Minister for State-Owned Enterprises, Raphael Tonpi, defended the move, stating that while he sympathizes with struggling parents, the district cannot continue funding tertiary students due to financial constraints.
He explained that MMDDA’s priority is to rehabilitate schools, construct new classrooms, staff housing, and administrative buildings, as well as expanding education access in remote areas. So far, the district has successfully established 16 new primary schools and seven new high schools.
Tonpi highlighted that the cost of supporting tertiary students is unsustainable, as it could consume up to 50% of the District Services Improvement Program (DSIP) funds, affecting other development projects. He reminded parents that the government has already provided 12 years of free education from elementary to Grade 12 and urged them to take personal responsibility for their children’s higher education.
He also criticized the tendency of some parents to spend money on non-essential customary obligations, such as compensation, gambling, and ceremonies, instead of prioritizing education. ""We should be competing in paying school fees, not spending on unnecessary things for status and fame,"" he said.
Tonpi called on parents to start financial planning early and avoid last-minute struggles when their children are selected for tertiary education. ""This is a tough but genuine call. Parents must take ownership of their children's education and prepare for school fees instead of waiting for government assistance,"" he emphasized.
With this decision, MMDDA aims to create long-term improvements in the district’s education system, ensuring that future generations have access to quality learning facilities."

Member for Mendi-Munihu, Raphael Tonpi, emphasized the need for accessible healthcare, particularly for pregnant mothers.
“Our district has experienced maternal deaths because these facilities aren’t available. That’s why we’ve provided each health centre with an ambulance, an ambulance shed, and a maternity ward,” he said.
Mr. Tonpi, who is also the Vice Minister for State-Owned Enterprises, assured that local companies are contracted for the projects under SHPHA’s technical supervision to meet healthcare standards.
Additionally, K500,000 has been allocated for upgrading Munhiu Health Centre, while the Kip United Church Hospital project is set for tendering soon.
“Small things matter. Try your best to stay healthy, but if you fall sick, it’s our responsibility to provide the health services you need,” Mr. Tonpi stated."

The 24-year-old Yaks Linus Wanamari, originally from Manjuat village in East Sepik was involved in a confrontation with law enforcement officers early Monday morning.
The sequence of events happened when the Trans-Crime Unit and the National Criminal Intelligence Unit alerted the police about Wanamari’s violent intentions. Armed with a homemade firearm, he attempted to commit arson and murder a person, a resident of the RD Cannery Ltd backyard settlement. The victim and his daughter reported the threat to the police.
Upon receiving the report, police officers promptly arrived at the scene. Wanamari, however, fled into nearby bushes, prompting a pursuit.
Madang Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim, confirmed that Wanamari was shot during the chase after he resisted arrest and brandished his weapon at the officers. The injured Wanamari was captured and transported to Modilon General Hospital for medical treatment.
While undergoing treatment for gunshot wounds to his leg in the hospital’s emergency ward, Wanamari managed to escape, adding another layer of complexity to the already tense situation.
“Despite his injuries, Wanamari managed to flee the hospital. We are continuing our search for him and urge the public to remain vigilant and report any sightings,” PPC Baim reported.
Wanamari’s criminal record is extensive and concerning, with charges that include wilful murder, arson, armed robbery, rape, attempted murder and manslaughter. His known hangouts include the RD Cannery Ltd settlement in Madang province and Bumbu Wara Market in Lae, Morobe province, making these areas focal points of the ongoing search efforts.
The police have intensified their operations to recapture Wanamari, urging anyone with information about his whereabouts to come forward.
“We will not rest until we locate you, including those who harbor criminal elements. Let me assure you, the law will catch up with you, and you will regret going against it. This applies to everyone for our collective safety, so be warned. My policemen will not tolerate such criminal activity in Madang. We will weed you out,” warned PPC Baim.
The incident highlights the urgent need for community cooperation in law enforcement efforts and the dedication of the police force to maintaining safety and order despite the challenges they face. The search for Wanamari continues, with authorities committed to bringing him to justice and ensuring the safety of the public."

The full course program will commence in 2026.
ITI Chairman and Co-founder, Senthil Kumaran Sentheyval shared that this is a big milestone for the school from when they began.
“This was a dream for us to have a degree. I mean, we had lot of challenges throughout the last 25-26 years as being a private institution, it was not easy.

Three arrested for Baruni murder,21/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3284,"On Wednesday, February 19th NCD Police arrested three men allegedly involved in the rape and murder of the late Margaret Gamaru Gabriel at Baruni on Saturday, February 15th, 2025.
One of the suspects apprehended had on a necklace that witnesses identified as belonging to the deceased.

Madang gets GTFS school supplies,21/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3278,"Schools in Madang are picking school supplies for the academic year at the Marape Hall at Tusbab Secondary School.
The stationary, which arrived last October, were purchased as per the Government Tuition Fee Subsidy (GTFS) policy.
They are mostly teaching and learning materials.
Tusbab Secondary Deputy Principal Administration, Michael Kavagu, has put a call out to schools who have yet to collect their supplies, to do so immediately to free up the Marape Hall for school activities.
Mr. Kavagu said of the six districts, schools in Middle Ramu and Rai Coast have yet to move their supplies out.
Meantime, Tusbab Secondary is faced with enrolment challenges, particularly finding space for transfer-in students. This week, the school grounds was overcrowded as students and parents came in numbers to see if they made the acceptance list. Mr Kavagu said police had to be called in to calm anxious and disgruntled parents.
According to the town mayor, Peter Yalsy, the government has imposed its ‘Leave no child behind’ policy and they would like to help as many students and parents as possible. He said many parents want their child to attend Tusbab Secondary.
Tusbab Secondary recently opened two additional grade nine classrooms. Besides building more classroom infrastructure, the school has put to the government to upgrade primary schools like Holy Spirit Primary, Lutheran Day Primary or Kusbau Primary School to junior high schools, to alleviate overcrowding challenges."
Industrial engagement way forward for inmates,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3273,"Developing productive industries within the PNG Correctional Services could help reduce costs and contribute to local economic development, says Prime Minister Marape.
He was speaking during his address to the CS PNG Correctional Services in Port Moresby on Sunday 16th February 2025. The event was attended by the Acting Correctional Services Commissioner, Bernard Nepo, Minister for CS, Joe Kuli, and other senior members and staff of the CS.
Marape expressed that if prison labour is integrated into productive industries, the labour cost will be much lower.
“Instead of idly sitting, inmates can be training in industries that will help them reintegrate into society, while also reducing costs for the state,” he explained.
Meanwhile, Acting Correctional Services Commissioner, Bernard Nepo said CS already has rehabilitation programmes for the inmates including industrial skills, with the full support of the government.
“We have existing prison industries right around the country, taking a communal approach, but having given the support by the government, what we’ll do is maximize all the prison industries and we will try to commercialize them.
“The prisoners who are rehabilitated will be put in those industries, they will work in those industries, and if we generate enough money, at least they have some money in their account, and so when they are released, they’ll go out with the skills, with the tools that we’ll issue and them with their certificates,” Nepo said.
He said they will be partnering with institutions like Mapex, with whom they had already established talks leading soon to the signing of a MoU with the education department to pave the way for better plans for TVET programmes.
Further in his call, Prime Minister Marape urged the PNGCS leadership to think beyond short-term operations and work towards a transformative correctional system that will define PNG’s future by 2045.
Nepo said he is determined to secure funding so they will be able to put up extra classrooms for the training to eventuate, if not this year, then next year.
Prime Minister Marape also affirmed the government’s commitment to invest in correctional services, security, and rehabilitation programmes, ensuring that PNGCS is not just a detention facility but a key contributor to PNG’s development."
Gov’t support CS rehabilitation,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3271,"PNG Correctional Services has been commended by Prime Minister James Marape for being the most disciplined force among the country’s security agencies while challenging its leadership to elevate its role in nation-building and rehabilitation.
Marape outlined an ambitious 20-year vision for PNGCS, emphasizing discipline, rehabilitation, and economic contribution through vocational training.
Acting Correctional Services Commissioner, Bernard Nepo who was present with the Minister for CS Joe Kuli and other senior officers of CS and staff, received the commendation from the Prime Minister on Sunday 16th positively.
PM Marape had said the CS is not just about imprisonment; it is about correction and rehabilitation.
“Prison is a place where we have to have a positive outlook for people who are brought into our custody. So Prime Minister was expressing concern for how we can able to address the needs of prisoners, especially upskilling them, and so when they are released they can be able to contribute meaningfully.” Acting Commissioner Nepo said.
In reaffirming the PM’s commitment, A/Commissioner Nepo said the CS is now set to go, as under his leadership TVET programmes have already been rolled out under the rehabilitation programme within the prison.
“Previously it has been operating on a haddock basis, and so given the support by the current Marape-Rosso government we are now pursuing it aggressively so that the programmes will be replicated to the rest of the country,” said Nepo.
Nepo said the CS will be signing an MoU with the Education Department, for the TVET programmes, which in a few weeks, the PM will officiate at a ceremony so that it will pave the way for many positive things to come from the prison service.
He assures the public as well as key stakeholders that this programme will be done through the government’s triple ‘P’ policy; the Public Private Partnership. There will be community engagement through the churches, the education department, and the correctional service working as a team to get these projects to work throughout the country."
13 arrested for Popondetta robbery,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3270,"Popondetta police have so far apprehended about 13 suspects who were involved in the recent robbery in Popondetta Town.
Oro Provincial Police Commander Ewai Segi confirmed this. He said police are currently processing the suspects.
The Oro Provincial Government commended the police for their swift and successful operation in apprehending the suspects.
Oro Governor Gary Juffa reiterated the province’s firm stance against crime, stating that such lawless behaviour will not be tolerated. As part of the immediate response, the Governor has directed the provincial administration to proceed with the eviction of illegal settlers residing on government-owned land, which has long been a source of criminal activity in the province.
“The Oro Provincial Government has been working tirelessly to strengthen law enforcement, with a composite team from Southern Command stationed in the province for over a year and a half,” said Governor Juffa. “We will continue to maintain this team while building our police capacity, but we need urgent support from the national government.”
Governor Juffa emphasized the challenges faced by local law enforcement, particularly the insufficient resources allocated to provinces to combat rising crime rates.
“Our policemen and women are outnumbered and exhausted as they face increasing law and order challenges. The national government must take serious action to improve infrastructure, provide necessary funding, and address police welfare,” he said. “Provinces should be given block grants to deal with law and order issues effectively.
Simply cautioning, making recommendations, or discussing plans is not enough. We need immediate and tangible action to combat crime.”
The Oro Provincial Government urges the national government to take stock of the deteriorating law and order situation across the country and implement real, effective measures to restore safety and security for all citizens."

‘Who will be next?’,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3265,"The once peaceful East New Britain is becoming more and more unsafe for especially women and girls.
Rabaul resident and women’s advocate, Susie McGrade, expressed alarm at the spiralling law and order situation following the slashing of a Filipino woman on Sunday, February 16th, in Hot Rooster.
“Women are being slashed every day and we fear the next robbery won't just be bilum stealing and slashing on the way out. It will be rape,” she said.
“I’m third generation Rabaul. My (Scottish) grandparents who were here before World War II are buried here.
“I have spent pretty much my whole life here and I feel more Rabaul than anything else, and I have never felt so afraid in my life before,” expressed McGrade, who was one of the few expatriates who never left Rabaul during the 1994 twin volcanic eruptions.
“We need better police management and we want more police presence in urban areas, not at the police station but patrolling the streets.
“As a matter of urgency, we need radios on every police officer and in police vehicles.
“We want beanies or head coverings banned. We want loitering enforced. Mobs of youths, walking around, preying on women, need to be investigated or broken up.
“We women feel totally vulnerable and let down by the police. Whilst we have some police we respect and help us, we feel police management from the top is poor.
“Every woman in ENB is frightened. Who will be next?”
McGrade called for management and enforcement, saying island tourism has been obliterated because tourists do not feel safe anymore.
“Carnival cruise ships have pulled out of Rabaul.
“If tourists feel unsafe, how sad is it for the regular residents?”"
K30mil overhaul of Lae stadium,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3264,"Approximately K30 million is allocated for the complete overhaul of the rundown Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium in Lae, Morobe Province.
Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, said they aim to complete the first phase of the upgrade and open the sporting facilities to the public on September 16th; PNG’s 50th Independence anniversary.
The Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium was built for the 1991 South Pacific Games. Like other infrastructure in the country, it was left to deteriorate with betelnut-stained walls and floors, a badly damaged synthetic track, and worn-out and ill-equipped gyms.
Under the leadership of Lae MP, John Rosso, the Lae City Authority took over the stadium’s management through the signing of a lease agreement on Tuesday, the 3rd of October, 2023.
Rosso emphasised that the residents of Lae need to enjoy well-maintained facilities, that was why the conversation was initiated with the then Sports Minister, Don Polye, and the Sports Foundation, to let the LCA manage and maintain the stadium.
“The current stadium has been rundown for a long, long time,” outlined Rosso.
“It was under the National Sports Foundation but no attention had been given to it and it sits in the middle of Lae with a lot of people utilising it. It got to a point where the tracks were getting dangerous.”
Once upgraded, LCA anticipates opening up the facilities to host domestic and national events.
“So, the schedule for the completion of the first part of the stadium will be scheduled for September when we go into the 50th Independence anniversary. So, I’d like to give that as a present – a newly-renovated stadium – to the people of Lae.”
LCA now manages the entire indoor and outdoor stadium facilities including the netball and volleyball courts next to the Lae Rugby League ground.
This is all part of the Lae MP’s plan to restore Lae to the days when families enjoyed a peaceful and safer city."
Unemployment causes crime,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3263,"Unemployment is causing an increase in crime rates and the vagrancy Act is not the solution.
Chairman for National Research Institute, Wilson Thompson thinks that an increase in employment will decrease crime rates in the country.
“What we really need is to increase our outputs in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries space, so that creates the employment. We are talking about the crime in the city and all these problems, what we are seeing is that these people that are in Port Moresby, have been attracted and they're still going into Port Moresby. If you look at the highlands, not many Cocoa plantations are in operation. If you go down to the coast, there's no coconut plantations or rubber plantations, everyone is going into the towns and cities. What we need to do is create employment opportunities back in the rural areas.”
In welcoming the Government’s policy in the education sector where more education opportunities have bene made available for youths, he also thinks that more need to be done.
“The government has done fine in terms of education, creating free education, providing spaces. At the top, everyone is passing through. We have 8000 University spaces available, we've got about 30 or 40,000 in vocational centers or TVET centers, 10,000 in technical colleges, another 3000 in the teachers’ colleges, and everyone is going in there, and what will happen when they come out? where are they going to go? And yet, we are still creating more spaces for education and training. We are continuing to doing that, but we are not creating the opportunities for employment.”
He said the only way people can be taken off the streets is to increase income opportunities in the rural areas, by building factories in the poultry, livestock, forestry, agriculture and fisheries sectors.
Furthermore, Thompson said the Vagrancy Act that members of parliament and the public are stressing on is not the solution to a decrease in crime rates.
He said many who have lived their lives in the city have no place to go back home to , and if so people who have already voted for their members in parliament in the city and are registered in the electoral roll book will fight for their rights.
He said the only way is to create employment and income opportunities in the rural areas to allure people back to their homelands."
Maladina to seek legal clarification on Ministerial Determination,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3262,"Minister for Petroleum Jimmy Maladina in a press conference today announced the Government’s intention to file a Supreme Court reference to seek legal clarification regarding the implementation of the Ministerial Determination related to Petroleum Development License (PDL) 2.
This move aims to guide whether the beneficiaries from the Kutubu region are recognized under the provisions of the Oil and Gas Act.
By initiating this legal process, Maladina intends to ensure that the rights and interests of the landowners affected by the Ministerial Determination are upheld.
He has extended an invitation to both factions of the impacted landowner groups to participate in the proceedings, emphasizing the importance of their input in the legal deliberation.
Maladina said this collaborative approach aims to foster unity among the stakeholders and ensure that all voices are heard in the legal process.
“Our meetings this week with both parties have been very positive and encouraging. l appreciates the willingness of all sides to engage in open discussions, and I commend their respective leadership for their constructive approach,” Maladina stated.
Notwithstanding this legal step, Minister Maladina remains hopeful that a resolution can be reached through dialogue, without requiring the Court's intervention.
He further emphasized that, while discussions continue, landowners have now agreed to withdraw their ultimatum to the State as all parties work towards a lasting resolution within the confines of law and equity.
“The aggrieved landowners have shown good faith by withdrawing their ultimatum, and we will continue to work together to reach a fair and legally sound outcome.”
He further highlighted that, despite some disagreements, there are promising areas of agreement that can be built upon in the coming days and weeks to find a sustainable resolution.
Maladina reaffirmed his commitment to working closely with all parties to bring certainty to the benefit-sharing arrangements for PDL 2, stating that a mutually agreed solution remains the best possible outcome.
Meantime, the Chairman of Namo Aporo Landowner Association, John Kapi Nato and Foe Landowner Association have pledged to work with the Government and solve this issue amicably."

Keeping the Kangal alive,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3256,"Papua New Guinea is truly a unique country blessed with diverse cultures and traditions. This diversity differentiates each province, district and even the smallest of groups like villages, especially in local vernaculars and dialects. There is so much more to learn about the significance and historic value of each culture and tradition.
We zero in on the Rai Coast District, which recently observed the 16th annual festival of the significant Kangal Headdress, worn only by men. The Kangal Festival united five village communities, who speak different dialects but are connected by the Kangal ritual and dance. It performed to signify the transition of a boy into manhood and his role in the society. It takes years to master a synchronized Kangal performance in accordance with its intricate designs and exclusive paintings and dance moves. Soge Dilambe, Ward 6 Councilor and Founder Kangal Festival explains.
“Bifo long ol grup kam, man bai (statim) singsing nau Kangal lain bai kam insait long ples blong singsing. Ol lain ba laitim bombom na apim so ol ken lukim bilas blong em, hau em paint na kam.”
(Before the dancing group enters the arena, one man will start the chanting. He will also light up dried coconut leaves to signal the Kangal performers and also identify the paint on the Kangal headdress.)
The Kangal moves into the arena as unique dance moves are performed. The notorious Finisterre range shares a border with the Sarawagec range in Morobe province. The people in this region carry the Kangal culture.
“Igat Madang, na mipla tok igat Morobe. Wanem samting kamap long namel em olsem as blong Kundu long hap (points to Morobe), lip blong em lo hia (points to his feet), Garamut long hap (points to Madang), lip blong em long hia (points to his feet). Tupla diwai i stap olsem.
(The roots of the kundu is in Morobe, its leaves are in Bandit. The garamut’s is in Madang, its leaves are in Bandit. The culture is with me in the middle.)
As sacred as their dances are, the Kangal culture practicing groups are not allowed to call out its name in public for fear of being cursed or inviting misfortune in their lives.
“Em spirit yah, nogut mi tokaut na bai mi sik o kain osem. O yu lukim na bai yu sik o… yu meri, yu nonap lukim hau ol karim Kangal. Em tambu. Singsing long nait, em yu harim stori tasol. Blong morning, em san so bai yu lukim ol bilas tasol.”
(It’s a spiritual being. If I call out its name, I could get sick, or if (women) see it, you might get sick. The performance at night is not supposed to be seen. In the morning, (women) will only see the traditional decorations used during the rituals and dance.)
Red and black dances are performed either under the cover of darkness to dawn, and during the day. Dilambe says each performance is strictly times. He would very much like to share this with the world.
“Igat kainkain kala blong Kangal. Wanpla misla sa tok Duangnu, em longpla. Narapla mipla tok bilak singsing, bai yu lukim olsem ambrela. Em blong nait. Narapla em Dama, narapla em mipla kolim Bangian.”
(The Kangal headdress comes in various colours and designs. One called Duangnu is long. Another, which is part of the Black dance, is umbrella-shaped and is performed only at night. One other is called Dama and another called Bangian.)
Before becoming the Ward 6 Councilor, Dilambe had the foresight of making their culture and tradition a way forward for his people to benefit sustainably, instead of bringing in logging or mining. The mission to his vision began in 2003 when he approached former Madang Visitors and Cultural Bureau director, Taba Silau. Mr. Silau gave him directions on how to create traditional groups and have them registered for events.
In 2008, after all procedures and protocols came into place, the Kangal Festival was birthed and in 2022 it was included in the National Cultural Commission (NCC) calendar of events. In 2024 the 16th Kangal Festival was held.
The festival’s museum is in Bandit village. The museum holds all cultural items from the five Kangal performing wards. In this museum, only men are allowed inside. Females are not allowed to enter because the cultural centre is also an initiation site for young boys to transition into men; ready to carry the Kangal.
The first day of the 16th Kangal Festival was hosted in Umboldi. Day two continued at Saidor Station. Villagers left Umboldi for Saidor - a six-hour walk that included scaling steep mountains in the chilly air, and a few dips in the cool pristine mountain creeks.
The dawn dance in Saidor, kicked off at midnight and concluded at 7am to begin the second day of the festival. These were sacred dances not meant for display under light. An exception was made for the media.
The dance by the Gwarawon group from Nayudo LLG was the highlight. They performed the black dance without the Kangal as it was their first time to participate in a Kangal ritual and dance. Group leader, Nai Dongkine, explained that once they start this performance, the singing does not stop until the break of dawn. The song they performed was a fusion of voices in different tones. They sing about many values and tie it to initiation, marriage, customary obligations and death.
Dongkine said, “Displa singsing long tokples mipla kolim long Kongkap. Em minim olsem singsing blong tewel man. Displa singsing em no wankain osem red singsing we man na meri tromoi lek na singsing wantem. Ol man tasol save singsing. Nau ol man i pasim disla (singsing), ol fit lo marit na lukautim (femli). Em bilip blo mipla.
(We call this song ‘Kongkap’ in our language. It is a song for the evil spirit and only men sing it. Unlike the red songs where women can dance with men. Men who perform the black dance, they are fit to marry and have a family. That is our belief.)
“Neks yia bai mipla kam, kisim ol ambrela singsing na sanampim Kangal.
(Next year we will come to the festival with the umbrella Kangal and perform.)
“Man i sa stap hait tasol na bai yu harim nek tasol blo disla singsing. Nau tasol ol kam ples kilia. Bifo taim em ol stap lo hausman tasol na ol meri bai go na givim kaikai long ol tewel man yah.
(In the past, man would be in the cover of the man’s house and you would only hear their voices singing the Kongkap. Women would bring food to the evil spirit to which the song is for.
“Sapos yu save osem ol twentipla man, em yu harim twentipla nek. Olgeta wanwan blong ol igat nek blong ol yet ol save yusim long singsing. Sapos wanpla idai, na mipla planim em, bai mipla mas singsing long nek blong em.
(If you knew 20 men were part of the singsing group, exactly 20 voices would be singing the song. Every single one has a tune they sing to. If one of them dies, we would sing at his burial, in the tune that he sang to while alive.)
“Nau yet em tetipla nek yet ol singsing na long own nek blong ol. Niupla man bai yu faul. Tasol long mipla, mipla ken stap longwe, but sapos mipla harim nek blong wanpla, mi save husait i kam pinis long ples blong singsing.
(Right now, 30 men are in this singing group and they are singing to 30 different tunes. For someone new to this, they will not be able to tell who is singsing and to what tune. For the trained ears, we can be far away from the singing group, but we can tell who just joined the singing group by the tune that he is singing to.)
Council Dilambe longs to see tourists berth on their shores to witness the Kangal festival. He acknowledges that there is so much yet to accomplish in terms of infrastructure and hospitality services for visitors. This keeps him determined to pursue his tourism dreams."
Madang gets new single police barracks,19/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3254,"A new barracks for single police officers was officially commissioned at the DCA area in ward eight of Madang urban local level government recently.
Commissioned on Thursday 13th February, the 10-men single units was constructed by AR Pacific Limited at a portion of land situated near its company yard in DCA, a notorious area known for criminal activities over the years.
Governor, Ramsey Pariwa who opened the barracks said for far too long, Madang has been in the spotlight and received name tags such as the ‘Murder Capital’ of the country. Law and order issues were a rife in the province from petty crimes to heinous murders.
He said the government has now been empowering police force to effectively counter law and order issues by implementing and supporting Community Policing Units in crime hot spot areas, increasing manpower, providing resources and infrastructures and now the opening of the barracks.
Governor Pariwa said that combating law and order in the province needed collective efforts not only from the government but also through public-private partnership.
“Law and order is everyone’s business. Law and order em stap long finger blong mipla, em stat long haus na kam. We as citizens create law and order issues. If we all say NO to law and order, there will not be any problems in the community. Fighting Law and order is not only police responsibility nor the leaders’ but everyone’s responsibility,” Governor Pariwa said.

PM maintains support for judicial reforms,19/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3252,"Prime Minister James Marape has commended the justice sector’s efforts in strengthening the rule of law and advancing critical legal reforms over the past six years.
He reaffirmed the independence of the judiciary and continued reform in a recent meeting with Department of Justice and Attorney-General (DJAG) Secretary Dr Eric Kwa and other agency heads.
“The country exists because of the rule of law,” Prime Minister Marape stated. “Without it, we lose the foundation of our democracy and governance. The independence and functionality of our judiciary are paramount, and my government will continue to support efforts that uphold justice and strengthen the rule of law.”
Prime Minister Marape highlighted the need for continued reforms to bolster judicial processes, improve case management, and enhance the efficiency of the courts.
“Our courts must function without interference, and we must provide them with the necessary resources to ensure that justice is dispensed fairly and without delay,” he said.
Marape highlighted the importance of recruiting and retaining top legal minds, financial experts, and governance professionals for a robust and effective justice system.
He stressed on the need for digital transformation in the judiciary to improve efficiency, accessibility, and transparency.
“We need to modernise case management, streamline legal procedures, and leverage technology to improve service delivery. Delayed justice is denied justice.”
Housing and resource allocation for legal professionals were also recognized as a key priority in ensuring a strong judiciary, noting that a proper accommodation, competitive salaries, and better working conditions are necessary to attract and retain top-tier legal professionals.
“To have a competent and effective justice system, we must invest in our legal professionals. From salaries to housing and work resources, we must create an environment where the best legal minds can thrive and contribute meaningfully to our nation,” he said."
Numbalihi family call for action,19/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3251,"It has been a week since the passing of Lyna Numbalihi, a mother of two who was brutally murdered by her partner, a member of the PNG Defence Force.
With no progress update from the PNGDF, the family of late Lyna is calling on the force to come out clear and explain why it has taken long to apprehend the suspect.
“Your Men’s failure to act decisively and transparently in the pursuit of justice for Lyna raises serious concerns about the PNGDF's commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights and dignity of all citizens, including women and vulnerable people.
“The lack of progress by PNGDF in this case for over a week suggests negligence and complicity in aiding and abetting the perpetrator to evade justice. Such inaction is unacceptable and undermines public trust in the PNGDF as an institution tasked with safeguarding the nation and its people,” said Emmanuel Numbalihi.
In a letter to the PNGDF, Numbalihi demanded the following;
1. Immediate Arrest and Prosecution of the Perpetrator:
The PNGDF must take immediate and decisive action to locate, apprehend and hand over the perpetrator to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. Justice must be served without further delay to demonstrate that no one is above the law, regardless of their affiliation with the Defence Force;
2. Full Cooperation with Investigations:
The PNGDF must cooperate fully with law enforcement agencies and provide all necessary resources, eyewitness information and evidence and access (into the crime scene) to ensure a thorough and impartial investigation into this crime is carried out;
3. Compensation and Support for the Family:
The PNGDF must take responsibility for its role in this tragedy and provide financial assistance to the family of late Lyna to cover the costs of her funeral, repatriation and burial. As the wife of a serving member of the Defence Force, Lyna was part of the PNGDF family and it is the moral obligation of the institution to support her grieving family during this difficult time;
4. Public Accountability and Transparency:
The PNGDF must issue a public statement acknowledging its failure to protect Lyna and outlining the steps it is taking to ensure such a tragedy does not occur again. Transparency in this process is crucial to restoring public confidence in the Defence Force.
Meanwhile, Numbalihi said the brutal murder of Lyna is a stark reminder of the persistent issue of gender-based violence in society.
Since the death of Lyna, PNGDF has issued a statement, promising the family that a manhunt is on foot to apprehend the suspect. The force will ensure that he faces the full force of law when apprehended."

PNG Road Fund opens Lae office,19/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3238,"The PNG Road Fund will work towards maintaining the national road networks in PNG, ensuring that they meet acceptable standards.
The PNG Road Fund opened its second office at the Nadzab Tomodachi International Airport on Friday, February 14th.
Chairman of the road fund and Secretary for Finance, Samuel Penias, emphasised the importance of servicing an area that would contribute to the economic growth of this country.
The Lae office will focus on the Highlands Highway, the Ramu-Madang Road as well as the proposed Trans-National Highway that will be connecting Morobe Province to Port Moresby.
Similar sentiments were expressed by Works Secretary, Gibson Olemba, who outlined that “we are good at building roads, but we are not good at taking care of them”. This is why the PNG Road Fund was established; to maintain the national road network.
“The major network of our country is here in Lae because of the three national highways connected here; Ramu Highway, the main Highlands Highway – which is from Lae all the way to Kopiago; it connects the entire resource areas up in the Highlands region, including our Wau-Bulolo. And we’re currently reconstructing the Trans-National Highway.
“Having established the Road Fund office here is very strategic so we can raise funds to run road maintenance works across the country.
“We have almost 9,000km of national highway network which is currently funded through the Road Fund. And I’m thankful that the board has given us K25 million last year. We have started the road maintenance works, if you see from Two-Mile coming in to Yalu.”
Furthermore, as part of the road maintenance efforts, weighbridges will be established to collect fees, with Olemba stressing that most of the damaged pavements are caused by overloaded heavy vehicles.
The PNG Road Fund, established under the Road (Management and Fund) Act, 2020, is responsible for the collection, disbursement and monitoring of funds to maintain and upgrade the national road network."

Lavongai ‘maimai’ appeals for respect,18/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3230,"Mainland Kavieng has experienced an influx of people from Lavongai due to continuous fighting there.
With no police presence on New Hanover Island (Lavongai), in New Ireland Province, and no network coverage, petty crime has been allowed to fester over the years, leading to lawlessness.
The situation is similar on the mainland, with the arrival of Lavongai islanders over the years – including those from Mussau – adding on to the already stretched police manpower in the province.
Today, the people of Lavongai and Tigak have joined a peaceful protest around Kavieng town, led by the staff of the Kavieng Provincial Hospital. This follows two separate attacks on health workers by armed thugs from the nearby Pawa Haus settlement.
A ‘maimai’ (chief) from Lavongai, John Aini, is appealing to his people to respect and protect health workers, as a large number of Lavongais have resettled in the Pawa Haus settlement.
“Where will you go if you hurt health workers? Where can a pregnant mother go to, to access services, or where will you go if you’re sick?” Aini asked.
“If there are Lavongai people here who are breaking the law and causing disharmony, simply apprehend them and take them to the police.
“I’m tired of talking to Lavongais who have fled from the fighting, have resettled here, and are disturbing our peace.”
The New Hanover Island is two hours away from the mainland by boat. In 2024, fighting erupted between families in January, and continued unhindered for seven more months. Permanent houses were razed to the ground, two people were killed, many more injured and a large number of families were displaced.
Some of the displaced families moved further inland, into the bushes, while the rest made the 2-hour journey to Kavieng town and lived wherever they could."

“The students were exposed to the highest level of international diplomacy but as a student, I believe that will give them the confidence to their education later on in the future,” Kapak said.
Former student Sydell Mandau thanked Paradise College for the opportunity that has opened his eyes to see a lot of things and gain a lot of experience that he intends to contribute to the growth and development of PNG.

Recent attacks renew vagrancy debate,18/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3225,"The late Sir Julius Chan had foreseen the issues that would happen in the absence of a vagrancy act.
This was why, during the 2025 budget deliberation on December 16th, 2024, more focus was placed on implementing the vagrancy act.

“Go back to where you came from and contribute towards your people. You don’t go and cause disharmony amongst the people of New Ireland and some of the coastal villages that are very peaceful people.
“I applaud our late governor for the initiative he had taken to implement that and I think NCD Governor, Powes Parkop, is also pushing for it.
“We really need it.”
The New Ireland provincial law and order committee has passed a resolution to evict settlers at Pawa Haus settlement. However, the enforcement of this decision is now with the provincial administration and police.
At the national level, the vagrancy act is currently in Parliament and will be on the agenda when Parliament resumes in March.

The Prime Minister assured the nation that the government will spare no effort in ensuring that those responsible for this heinous act are swiftly brought to justice.
In a statement released this afternoon, PM Marape stated, “I am deeply shocked and outraged by this despicable crime. No woman, no child, and no citizen of this country should ever have to endure such horrifying violence. This is not just an attack on one individual; it is an attack on our collective sense of humanity and justice.”
“I have instructed our law enforcement agencies to leave no stone unturned in their investigations. The criminals responsible for this cowardly act must be caught and punished to the fullest extent of the law. Justice must be served, and I urge all citizens with any information to come forward and assist the police,” he added.
Prime Minister Marape also reiterated his government’s unwavering support for the eviction of illegal settlements that have become safe havens for criminals. He commended the National Capital District Commission for its ongoing efforts to dismantle these settlements, emphasising that law and order must be upheld in all communities.
“For too long, certain areas have become breeding grounds for criminal elements who terrorise innocent people, businesses, and communities. This must stop.

Propagating luffa in PNG,15/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3195,"Luffa, a tropical vegetable currently grown at the Taiwan Technical Mission project site located at Laloki in the Central Province, is not well-known in Papua New Guinea, however is used a lot in the Asian countries.
Although many are grown, the Taiwanese do not plan to sell them, instead are growing them for demonstration and propagation purposes and see how well it can thrive on PNG soil.
Luffa is a tropical vegetable and comes from the pumpkin, squash and gourd family.  The vegetable is healthy as it is used for eating, when dried can be a medicine for treating and preventing cold and used as a skin scrubber.
Jeffery Lin, a specialist for the Taiwan Technical Mission said; “Luffa is common in Chinese dishes, you find them sometimes in the supermarket shelves here in PNG. Luffa has potential because it’s easy to carry, to grow it and has a lot of use.
“It takes 2-3 months to grow and bear fruit and can stay in dry and wet season. It is also very good for the body.”
Taiwan Technical Mission has been in the country for several decades assisting local farmers especially in farming rice and are now branching into propagating other fruits and vegetables like Luffa, Bottle Gourd, Guava, Dragon Fruit, citrus fruits and many more.
Lin said training programs on how to cultivate other fruits and vegetables like dragon fruit and luffa can be conducted depending on interest from the Department of Agriculture and NARI."
Manam islanders briefed about court orders,14/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3192,"The Manam Human Rights Advocacy Group (MHRAG) which took the national government to court for human rights negligence against the 10,000 plus displaced Manam Islanders in Madang Province have started holding awareness sessions to inform people of the outcome of the court case and the implications of the court orders that were handed down by the National Court in Madang in September last year.
Starting on Monday 10th February, 2025, the team led by the Chairman Bruce Silla and his deputy Stanis Tibong and other executives started the awareness meetings from Asuramba Care Centre to Potsdam Care Centres, meeting with the displaced  islanders there.
Further on the island, they commenced at Kuluguma village on Monday 10th then on to Boda and Baliau the following days. They will continue to the other remaining villages in the next couple of weeks including Boesa island.
The meetings are to meet the people and fill them in on the court case and the implications of the court orders that were handed down bythe  National Court’s Justice Narakobi in September last year in Madang.
The National Court awarded 12 court orders in favour of more than 10,000 people, in which the national government was taken to task to respond accordingly to negligence of certain human rights, identified in the orders.
The Manam Islands took the state to court for breaching several human rights of the 10,000 plus displaced people of Manam after two major volcanic eruptions of 1994 and 2004.  A court case that spanned over almost four years concluded last year with twelve orders issued:
1) The implementation of the government’s program for permanent resettlement within a 24-month period,
2) Provision of monthly food rations until permanent resettlement,
3) For the establishment of a Police post for the care centers,
4) For the establishment of a fully-equipped doctor at the care centres,
5) For the provision of school fees for school children until permanent resettlement, and
6) For the immediate rehabilitation of the care centres, including repair and maintenance of water pumps installed in 2005 and others.
According to the MHRAG President, Bruce Silla, the response of the people has been very positive. Two major demands from the people are: the government to award full school subsidy for all Manam students; and for Manam Resettlement Authority (MaRA) to put it’s act in order in regard to its major task which is ‘resettlement’ of the people.
The National Court has scheduled to review the implementation of the court orders by 3rd March 2025, thus the advocacy group is moving against time to reach all the people before the review date."

Gregory Wii, appeared before the Madang District court for his first mention yesterday when his bail application was also heard.
The court denied him bail due to the gravity of the allegations against him and has been remanded at the Beon Correctional Facility together with his four co-accused.
The incident in question occurred on February 7th when constable Wii allegedly discharged shots into the air in close proximity to the residence of Dr. Jimmy Aipit around Kalibobo area.

Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim emphasized the duty of security forces to protect and serve the community, stating that, “Security forces are not above the law.

A father’s advise to young women and girls,14/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3187,"Corporal Emmanuel Numbalihi has just lost his eldest daughter in a brutal murder. Now he’s  calling on the younger generation to choose wisely who they intend to spend the rest of their lives with before having children with that person.
Young women who are in toxic and abusive relationships have also been challenged to leave before it is too late.
Emmanuel Numbalihi made these calls following the death of her eldest daughter at the hands of the very person she would have sought protection from. Lina was brutally tortured to death by her partner early this week.
“Today's generation who wish to get married must not marry a person who has money or a nice paying job, rather you must inquire if that person is genuine and capable of looking after you, look after your immediate family and is available to provide help when need to be. These are the types of people you must consider spending your future with.
“Another reminder is to seek approval from your parents before considering a future with that person. If your parents do not approve that relationship, then leave. Always trust your parent's opinion.
“As for late Lina, we did not approve her marriage with the perpetrator because he did not meet our expectations.
“With the inception of technology, many young people are influenced to do many things either good nor bad behind closed doors. Often they lie to their parents who think that they are with their friends, however, they are hanging out with their girlfriends or boyfriends. Therefore, it is important for younger generations to practice discipline and obey your parents. By doing that your life will be blessed in the future,” he said.
Late Lina’s father further warned young mothers who are in a toxic and abusive relationship to leave that relationship. Failure to do so may result in domestic violence or even death."

Operation Open Heart team arrives,13/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3183,"A heart specialist team of eight arrived in Port Moresby today for the annual Operation Open Heart program.
The international group of specialists will team up with some of Papua New Guinea’s best medical talents to perform open-heart surgeries over the course of the next three days.
Leading the team is Anaesthetist Dr Darren Wolfers, a pioneer of the Operation Open Heart program since its inception in 1994.
For over 30 years now, the program has been providing life-saving, heart surgeries for the people of Papua New Guinea.
On arrival today, with a specialist team of eight, Dr Wolfers highlighted the advancement of the Papua New Guinea’s own medical professionals.
When asked about how proud he was of the progress of the program he said, “We’re actually not proud of ourselves, we’re proud of the local team. You will notice from when we come, we’ve had teams as big as sixty people, we’re down to eight. And the reason we’re down to eight is because the local program is going so well. So that’s what we should be proud of, just like the country is developing, so is the cardio-surgical program.”
The international team is set to have a brief with their Papua New Guinea counterparts this afternoon with the patient list confirmed.
However, Dr Wolfers said, “I believe we’re gonna be doing five operations in the next three days. We’re not doing the surgery. We’re gonna be assisting the local team to do the work. We’re gonna be focusing mainly on adults on this trip. But there’ll be some more pediatric trips coming later in the year.”

Cyberbullies Face Arrest,13/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3180,"Prime Minister James Marape has ordered an immediate investigation into the cyber-bullying targeting Miss Papua New Guinea, May Hasola, directing police and the Department of Communications & Information Technology to track down and arrest the offenders. He expects a progress report by next week.
Marape strongly condemned the online abuse and warned that continued misuse of social media could lead to government-imposed restrictions.

""As a father of girls and the symbolic father to all daughters of PNG, I am aggrieved to read these highly inflammatory and derogatory remarks, and strongly condemn these cyber-bullying against Ms. May Hasola,"" Marape stated.
He praised Hasola for her performance, emphasizing that the Miss Pacific platform unites the region regardless of competition outcomes. Marape referenced Leoshina Kariha, a Bougainvillean who won the Miss Pacific title in 2019, to illustrate the prestige and high standards of the competition.

"Over 2,000 students register at FODE centre",13/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3175,"Over 2,500 students are expected to register at Morobe’s Flexible Open Distance Education (FODE) Centre, in Lae, by the end of February.
FODE is an alternate pathway for students that have been pushed out of the formal, or conventional education system, to upgrade their marks and keep working towards their dreams.
Morobe’s FODE Centre has so far registered more than 2,500 students; and more are still coming.
Provincial FODE Coordinator, Helen Elecor, said the intakes are not only from Lae; they are also from the rural districts of Morobe and from Madang, East Sepik and the Highlands region.
“Registration started on the 4th of February because on the 3rd, we couldn’t do that because of the death of the late Sir Julius Chan,” said Elecor. “
So, from the 4th, we saw a huge population coming here for registration. We estimated about 2,500 to be registered but we have jumped that figure so we had to print extra orientation notes for the parents.”
Elecor said they came up with the idea of orientation notes this year as many parents and students were still confused about the functions of a FODE centre.
Additionally, the registration process was faster this year as the centre’s bank deposit slips and receipts were printed by the PNG University of Technology (Unitech), and were readily available to students and guardians.
“Before we started registration, our boys were doing printing and collating in the night,” explained Elecor. “But I think we will approach Unitech to do some of our printings as well.
“So, our biggest challenge is finance. One purchase made to print our materials will cost around K20,000; 100 boxes of A4 papers, coloured papers and ink.
“We have our mini printery there with four men handling it. All the other staff members help with collating, so that is how we’ve managed to survive.”
To support itself, the FODE Centre charges an administration fee of K205; K100 for registration, K65 for uniforms and K40 for ID cards.
“We are charging K40 this year because we want to print that on a PVC (polyvinyl chloride) card.
“We are also collecting assignment fees. When students bring their completed assignments, we record them then give to secondary school teachers to help us mark them. We then pay them K5 per booklet. We collect K6 from a student, K5 goes to the marker and K1 for our centre; for our ink and paper.
“And in the event that a student scores below 60 percent; that’s this year’s percentage for ‘redo’ assignments. So, after they do the assignments, the teachers will calculate and if they score below 60 percent, we will ask them to pay a penalty fee of K20 to redo the assignment. So, these are some of the ways we are making money to support our operation.”"

“We sent her to the market and expected her to come back home but she never did, only to be notified through a phone call from the hospital to identify her body,” he said.
The Papua New Guinea Defence Force has assured the family that the offender will be brought to justice.
“We cannot accept this act,” Chief of Defence Force Rear Admiral Philip Polewara said.
“It is totally unacceptable and does not reflect the values and beliefs of the PNGDF.  And I want to assure the parents and the family of the deceased spouse that we will work with the police to hunt and apprehend the member so that justice can be served.”
The PNGDF through the Military Police have taken action since the report of the incident was received on Sunday 9th February. On the same day, military police personnel had moved into the member’s room and cordoned it off to allow for civil police to conduct their investigations.
Formal enquiries were also conducted to establish witnesses before, during and after the incident. This has resulted in identifying a key witness to the crime.
“Our military police personnel are working closely with their counterparts at the Boroko Police station to ensure this matter goes to court,” Rear Admiral Polewara said.
Police Commissioner David Manning also confirmed yesterday that RPNGC is working with the Military Police to apprehend the fugitive.
Commissioner Manning said police join with the military in condemning the alleged crimes and are cooperating to find and detain the man.
“Any form of domestic violence is reprehensible and is not tolerated by our communities.” Commissioner Manning said.
“These crimes are made even more intolerable when the perpetrator is part of our disciplined forces who has made an oath to protect Papua New Guineans.
“It is pleasing to see close cooperation between our investigators and Military Police on this matter.
“When he is caught, he will be processed for arrest on criminal charges, while at the same time the PNGDF will deal with internal military issues relating to this individual.”
Commissioner Manning said the RPNGC and PNGDF appeal to any member of the public who has knowledge of the accused’s whereabouts to step forward and reveal this information.
“Harbouring a fugitive is a serious crime. Any person found to be involved in harbouring a criminal will also face criminal charges.
“As a father, I share my grief at this vicious crime. I offer my condolences and those of our disciplined forces to Corporal Numbalihi, father of the late Lina Numbalihi, and his family for their terrible loss.
“Rest assured the men and women of Police and Defence are working together to achieve justice for your family.”"
Preserving PNG’s Audio History for Future Generations,13/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3172,"The National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) is leading a crucial initiative to preserve Papua New Guinea’s rich audio history, with support from the Australian government’s Media Development Initiative (MDI).
NBC’s Secretary and Archivist Ben Takap has been at the forefront of the NBC Audio Archive – Analogue to Digital project since 2021, working to digitize decades of invaluable recordings, including interviews, speeches, talk shows, and news reports.
With MDI’s backing, Takap partnered with an Australian expert in 2023 to archive up to 40,000 audio reels from national and provincial NBC stations.
He emphasised the long-term significance of the project, stating, “Two hundred years from today, a person might want to know what was said in a ceremony, and we want that content to be available for them.”
Takap highlighted that these recordings represent PNG’s history and heritage, serving as essential resources for future broadcasts and research. He noted that NBC is committed to improving the quality and accessibility of its archived content through digitization.
As PNG approaches its Independence Jubilee, NBC’s collaboration with MDI is expected to enhance the country’s ability to commemorate historical milestones through preserved audio records.
On World Radio Day, Australia has acknowledged NBC’s decades-long role as PNG’s public broadcaster, reaffirming its support for NBC’s efforts to enhance news production quality and long-term archival strategies."
ENB administrator reflects on Huris trip,13/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3170,"More than 150 people from East New Britain Province gathered on Thursday, 6 February, to attend the funeral of the late Sir Julius Chan in Manmantinut in Namatanai, New Ireland Province.
The group, including public servants and parliamentary leaders, journeyed on two ships, MV Pomio 1 and 2, bringing along a choir, a traditional cultural group, food donations, and supplies for use during their three-day stay at Huris in Namatanai.
During an interview on Radio NBC ENB, ENB provincial administrator, Levi Mano, reflected on the trip, explaining that it was intended to pay final respects to one of PNG's pioneering leaders, who passed away on January 30th.
Mano outlined that the effort was a collaboration between the ENB provincial government administration and the entire government of the New Guinea Islands region.
“The full contingent, representing the entire islands region, was formed with the intention of uniting the region as we mourn the loss of one of our founders,” Mano said.
“The late Sir Julius Chan was a key architect of our country's financial system and made significant contributions during both the pre- and post-independence era.”
Mano mentioned that Sir Julius’ life extended beyond politics. Culturally, he had a deep-rooted background in his province and the islands community.
“We believe that it’s fitting to now share this moment with Sir Julius' family by attending his burial at his home in Manmantinut, Huris, Namatanai.”
The business community in the islands region also contributed to the haus krai (funeral), which the team brought to Huris, the final resting place of the late Sir Julius.
Mano said the trip was meant to demonstrate that the loss is not just theirs, but it is a loss for everyone in the region and the entire country.
He urged leaders in whatever positions they hold in politics, business, family or clan to emulate the late Sir Julius Chan’s life.
He commended the business community, parliamentary leaders, civil servants and the general public for making the trip to Namatanai to mourn the loss of a great leader and founder."
MKA blames election delay to lack of funding,13/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3168,"The Motu-Koita Assembly has responded to a petition presented this week demanding the immediate conduct of the Assembly Elections and a change of office executives. MKA chairman, Dadi Toka Jr has attributed the delay in the conduct of elections to a lack of funding.
Dadi Toka Jr in a statement assured the people and stakeholders that the administration has always been prepared and ready to support the elections since 2023. However, he said the funding allocation of K750, 000 by NCDC in 2023 for this purpose was insufficient as the assembly needed K7 million to conduct the elections as advised by the Electoral Commission.
“This K7million is supposed to be funded by the national government under the national Bbdget. This has not happened for the last three years. Every November since 2022 when the national budget is passed into law by Parliament, the MKA administration always immediately checks if the allocation has been made to fund the Motu Koita elections. For three consecutive years we have not seen any allocations at all, and we do not know why this fails to happen every year.”
He further stated that the 2023 election was also delayed due to deficiencies in the electoral roll like missing names (between 30 per cent to 70 per cent of previously registered voters’ names missing), logistics issues as well as constant changing of key dates for the roll update exercise.
However, Member for North West, Lohia Boe Samuel who led the petitioners on Monday states otherwise.
“There is no law stating that Cencus should be a reason for a delay of elections, so we don’t accept that.”
Meantime, while the MKA Chairman has blamed the lack of funds for the ongoing delay in MKA elections,
NCD Governor Powes Parkop upon receiving the petition on Monday mentioned that funds shouldn’t be an issue and can be solved.
“Last year, we put money in NCDC budget to fund the Motu-Koita elections, this year too, we have just passed our budget last Tuesday, and there is a funding to for Motu-Koita. We have funded the in the past as well. So funding is not really an issue.
Parkop further said, “Perhaps, if there's an issue we can solve that because when the Assembly is in election or is sort of in a transition, we can also use the money allocated to Motu-Koita Assembly to fund your election. It's your money, we are spending it on your election. So if the Electoral Commission doesn't have the money, of course, we can, back up the Electoral Commission, and we've done that in the past. It's normal practice.”
The petition also indicated an immediate removal of the current assembly members, including incumbent Chairman Dadi Toka Jr., and appointment of an interim caretaker administration to prevent misuse of MKA funds.
MKA confirmed that on Wednesday 5th February 2025, K500,000 was approved to support the 2025 MKA Elections and they now await official directions from the PNG Electoral Commission regarding confirmed MKA election dates for 2025."

PNG’s efforts in addressing corruption not reflective in 2024 corruption report,12/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3158,"Papua New Guinea has scored 31 out of 100 countries in the 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).
The 2024 CPI index scoring for PNG reflects a high perceived risk of encountering corruption in interactions with the public sector in the country.
TIPNG Chair Peter Aitsi during the launch of the 2024 CPI yesterday in Port Moresby said the country’s CPI score paints a stark picture that despite pledges and sporadic efforts, PNG is not making a significant impact in the fight against corruption.
“This lack of progress has dire consequences, most notably the recent Financial Action Taskforce (FATF grey-listing, which has serious flow on impacts to our international banking arrangements and country credit rating,” he said.
“The result of the CPI and FATF assessments are a clear indicator that Papua New Guinea is failing to take action on corruption. Millions are still being stolen through various means which robes the public and prevents them from accessing essential services such as quality education and health, it reduces economic and income opportunities and undermines trust in the government,” Aitsi said.
The Corruption Perception Index is a report that scores countries and territories around the world that record perceptions of public sector corruption. The scores reflect the surveyed views of economic experts and business people, not the general public. Countries are scored on a scale of 0 to 100. Hundred being very clean and zero being highly corrupt.
TIPNG CEO Arianne Kassman said the CPI index clearly shows that there is no effective process to combat corruption in PNG.
Meanwhile, ICAC Deputy Commissioner Daniel Baulch said failure to stop corruption may result in dire impacts on economic process, and security concerns, among others."

K1.4 billion loan within budget framework,12/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3151,"Prime Minister James Marape has provided assurances on the K1.4 billion (approximately A$580 million) loan from the Australian Government, stating that it is well within Papua New Guinea’s 2024 Budget framework and does not increase the country’s debt burden beyond planned fiscal targets.
Speaking at the NASFUND FM100 Talkback Show launch on Monday, PM Marape reiterated that the loan is part of the government’s fiscal strategy and fits within its ongoing fiscal consolidation plan.
“It’s within our 3.3% deficit of last year. Those of you commentators in the economic space, our report on our budgeting side is clearly outlined in our final budget outcomes,” the Prime Minister explained.
PM Marape emphasised that PNG remains on track towards achieving a balanced budget by 2027, with consistent deficit reductions over the past five years.
“We want to move to a surplus in 2027, and we are on target. In 2020, our deficit was at a high of over 8% due to COVID-19. Since then, we have scaled down: in 2022, it was around 5.3%, in 2023, it was 4.3%, and last year, we brought it down to 3.3%,” he stated.
The Prime Minister reassured the public that the Australian loan is not an additional financial burden but rather part of an agreed-upon fiscal framework.
“The Australian financing is within the 2024 money plan, part of our 3.3% deficit element. It is not something new and does not aggravate our debt plan. It is consistent,” he said. Furthermore, the terms of the loan include a grace period and a 4.2% interest rate, making it a structured and manageable component of PNG’s financial plan.

The Budget income includes K24.7 million rollover funds and K33.7 million for new revenue projections and estimates.
Sohe MP and DDA chairman, Henry Amuli emphasized the importance of prudent management of funds to ensure intended projects and programs are delivered.
He said ensuring rural connectivity through improving and opening up road networks and telecommunication infrastructures to connect unreached and isolated communities continues to be a priority in the 2025 money plan for Sohe.
There are four Local Level Governments (LLGs) in Sohe, two of which are very remote and not connected by roads. Amuli said delays to projects have been due to court disputes from 2017 elections, however he is now committed to delivering projects.
""We have over K24 million funds roll over from last year being tied to various impact projects and once Treasury Department approves our budget, we will start implementation,"" he said.
He said few impact projects include commencement of work on new Sohe District Administration complex and three new telecommunication infrastructures to enhance network coverage in remote communities.

PNG’s electoral process needs overhaul,11/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3144,"Papua New Guinea’s electoral process must be fixed before the 2027 national general election, says the President of PNG Law Society Hubert Namanai.
Namani said this during the 2025 legal year opening in the National Capital District recently.
“If we do not fix our electoral process now, we risk even greater instability in 2027, and judging from the January 10th event, I fear the worst.
“We are also learning with serious concerns that the 2022 Electoral Boundaries Commission maps created inconsistencies, leaving some areas without proper representation while others overlap. This is a blunder that must be called and not be ignored.
“A glaring example of our systemic failure is the deeply flawed electoral process, which undermines democracy at its core.
“Widespread irregularities, violence, and compromised integrity have eroded public trust, making urgent electoral reforms essential to restore faith in our democratic institutions and governance.
He said the legitimacy of any government depends on free and fair elections, but PNG continues to operate under a broken system.
“The best gift the Government can give to our people as we look to the next 50 years and beyond is a reformed electoral process.
“A system that ensures every citizen’s vote counts, that is free from violence and fraud, and that restores faith in our democracy."
Bugandi celebrates growth,11/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3141,"Prudent school management is important if an institution is to progress.
Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, outlined this when opening a new 8-in-1 classroom for Bugandi Secondary School on Monday, 10 February.
Rosso has always emphasised on prudent management and what can be achieved if leaders are transparent and accountable in their dealings.
Education institutions are no different, with Rosso outlining that the appointment of a good principal was the first step in restoring one of Lae’s oldest schools, the Bugandi Secondary School.
Bugandi, from being a top school, dropped in academic performance, had badly deteriorated classrooms – which were built in the 60s – no stationery, no electricity and no water supply due to unpaid bills, students were in half uniforms and were always involved in school fights.
Things started turning around in 2022 when Rosso visited the school and decided to change Bugandi’s administration.
“The next step was to look for a good principal because a sense of everything you do – everyone gives credit to someone like me; someone like me gets the ideas but you need people behind the scenes to make it run and happen.
“I visited Christopher Raymond at Lae Secondary School – I’m an ex-Lae sec student – and with Dennis Miall, your current principal. I said: ‘We really need a good manager at Bugandi. Not just a principal but a manager, to motivate people, to make sure everything runs well. I’ll put money into it. But who’s going to run for me?’
“So, Dennis, I can reflect, he said: ‘Wssh, I don’t want. That school has a lot of problems.’”
Rosso and Lae secondary’s principal managed to convince Miall, who was then transferred to Bugandi to start restoration efforts.
“I looked at the teachers and I felt really sorry,” continued Rosso. “They were struggling to teach students with very little support.
“Basically, the school was in a bad shape; financial mismanagement, it was not running properly. So, having Dennis appointed was one first step, then having a school board made up of good citizens to help the principal and staff run it, and then having a good staff with their morale being boosted, to help teach the children. And most importantly, making sure that the students were proud of coming to this school.”
Because of good management, the Lae City Authority funded Bugandi’s Grade 12 8-in-1 classroom last year, and this year, they opened another new 8-in-1 classroom for the Grade 11 students.
Every grade will have a new classroom building, with plans to build ablution facilities and a basketball court for Bugandi as well."
Major reforms expected for SOEs,11/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3140,"Major restructure is expected in the coming months for State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in order to improve efficiency, service delivery, and financial sustainability.
Prime Minister James Marape outlined the government’s plan to restructure key SOEs, focusing on introducing private sector expertise while maintaining government oversight.
He said key sectors like electricity and telecommunications, needed partial privatisation to enhance management and improve performance.
Addressing concerns over PNG Power’s inefficiency and unreliable electricity supply, Prime Minister Marape emphasised that private sector involvement is necessary to stabilise and improve service delivery.
“Power is a critical service, and we must ensure that PNG Power operates at a high standard. This means bringing in private sector expertise to improve management, infrastructure investment, and accountability,” he said.
The proposed reforms will ensure better infrastructure investment, more reliable electricity supply, and a financially sustainable PNG Power.
Marape said the telecommunications sector is also a priority for reform to improve service quality, affordability, and nationwide access to mobile and internet services. The government seeks private sector participation to drive faster internet, expanded coverage, and competitive pricing.
He acknowledged that the operational environment for SOEs has changed significantly since 1975, and it is no longer sustainable for the government to run these entities in the same way.
“We have been running our SOEs under the public service model for too long. “The conditions today are different from those in 1975. Back then, it was about delivering services as a public good. Now, these businesses must be run with efficiency and profitability in mind while still serving the people.”
Marape said to improve management and financial stability, the government is moving towards a 51 percent-49 percent public-private partnership model, where the government retains majority ownership while private investors take control of management and operations.
“We are looking at a model where we retain 51 percent ownership, while private sector partners hold 49 percent and manage the operations,” he explained.
“We call on investors—whether you are local, international, or superannuation funds—to take part in these reforms. When you hold 49 percent, you take management control, while the government remains a shareholder benefiting from dividends and improved services,” Prime Minister Marape added.
He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to SOE reforms as a key pillar of economic growth."
Motu-Koitabuans demand for MKA election,11/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3139,"Motu Koitabuans have expressed frustration over delay of the Motu Koita Assembly (MKA) elections, calling for the removal of Assembly members.
Motu Koitabu leaders gathered at the Sir Hubert Murray Stadium on Monday and presented a petition to the NCD Governor, Powes Parkop demanding immediate election.
Leading the petitioners was Member for North West, Lohia Boe Samuel, who said it was time to make the move, as many people have remained silent for too long.
He said for seven years, the MKA did not hold elections due to continuous delays. The petition signed by intending candidates and community stakeholders was addressed to the Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, Soroi Eoe and the Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai calling for an immediate election.
“We believed in the system, and the system has failed us. We've been waiting and waiting and the current regime has been in office for seven years. We cannot remain silent any longer,” said Samuel.
“The petition cites Section 50 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to vote and stand for public office. It states that the ongoing delay in holding elections is unconstitutional and denies the Motu Koita people their democratic rights. Current leadership has held office for over seven years, exceeding its legal term.”
Samuel said in 2023, about K750,000 was allocated by NCDC for the elections, which was not held. In 2024, election was again deferred without legal justification.
“We are demanding that our voices be heard, the people of Motu Koita have been deprived of their democratic rights. It is imperative that we conduct these elections without further delay to restore transparency, accountability, and trust in our governance,” stated Russell Simon Wavik, Fred Oala, and Nou Mataio, prominent Motu Koitabuans and intending candidates of the Motu Koita Assembly.
The petition stated the following;
•	Confirm an immediate date for the Motu Koita Assembly Elections
•	Adequate resources and logistical support for the elections
•	Transparent and fair electoral processes
•	Immediate removal of the current assembly members
Upon receiving the petition, Governor for NCD, Powes Parkop shared that he is concerned about the delay of MKA elections.
“Last year, we put money in NCDC budget to fund the Motu-Koita Election, and this year as we passed the new budget last Tuesday and there is funding for the Motu-Koita Assembly. We have funded the Motu-Koita Assembly in the past, so funding is not an issue.
“I acknowledge that the election has been delayed for a while, that is not fair, not right, and probably not legal. That's a matter not within my jurisdiction and power and authority, but as governor to have equal concern that Motu-Koita Assembly must have properly mandated leaders when one’s term has ended.”
The petitioners have given the Minister and Electoral Commissioner 21 days to respond, warning that failure to act will result in legal action."

PM to review government performance,10/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3135,"Prime Minister James Marape has announced a thorough review of government performance, with all department heads and ministers set to report on their progress, challenges, and plans.
This three-week assessment, leading up to the March Parliament session, aims to ensure effective governance and alignment with Papua New Guinea’s long-term economic vision.
“We are not a new government anymore. This is our sixth year in office, and we must be honest about what has been achieved and what still needs to be done. We cannot afford delays—we must move forward with urgency and focus,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
As part of the government’s long-term vision, Marape reaffirmed his commitment to economic transformation through import replacement, export-driven growth, and downstream processing.
“I just want to bring forward my own approach—to ramp up import replacement, focus on exports, and ensure people are actively participating in the economy. Downstream processing is the key to growing the economy, moving to K200 billion by 2030 and K3 trillion by 2048,” he said.
To achieve this, the government will focus on:
- Expanding PNG’s export base while reducing dependency on imports.
- Investing in ICT and green energy to drive innovation and sustainable development.
- Strengthening key sectors such as agriculture, mining, and fisheries to generate long-term revenue and employment.
The prime minister stressed that accountability is a priority, starting with his own Prime Minister’s Department, followed by Treasury, Planning, Finance, and other ministries.
“This scrutiny will involve cameras recording every conversation by department heads. I don’t want to carry free riders—I am running, and I want people to run with me, not walk when I am running,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Ministers and department heads will be assessed on their performance over the past two and a half years, with potential restructuring for those who fail to meet expectations.
“This is not personal. This is not about targeting someone—it is about being honest and making sure we are working and making progress instead of just occupying positions while doing little.
“I have no more time to waste. With over six years of experience as Prime Minister, I am ready to make bold decisions and cut out unproductive areas so our country can flourish.”
The prime minister emphasised that major reforms are needed, including:
- Public service restructuring to improve efficiency.
- Provincial government system reviews to strengthen decentralisation.
- Conclusion of the Bougainville Peace Agreement.
- Resource law reforms.
- State enterprise reforms.
- Fixing police and law enforcement agencies to improve security and governance.
- Judicial reforms.
- Parliamentary reforms.
“We are marking 50 years of independence, and it is time for bold and productive leadership. My generation must step up—with energy, commitment, and urgency—to fix today’s challenges and build a stronger PNG for the future.
“This government review will lead to a detailed 20-year roadmap, ensuring economic growth, governance stability, and national progress from 2025 to 2045, positioning PNG as a developed nation in line with Vision 2050.”"

Marape calls for leaders’ collective effort,09/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3126,"Prime Minister James Marape has called on every leader from the national to the provincial and district levels to prioritise development.
As Papua New Guinea mourns the passing of some of its most distinguished leaders, Prime Minister Marape said leaders must ensure that public funds are translated into tangible development for the people.
Speaking from Gasmata, West New Britain, the Prime Minister paid tribute to the late Sir Julius Chan, Sir John Luke Crittin of Milne Bay, Sir Charles Lepani, and Sir Paul Songo, acknowledging their contributions to the nation’s founding and development.
He noted that as their generation departs, the responsibility of leading and serving the country now rests with today’s leaders.
Prime Minister Marape emphasised that public resources allocated to District Development Authorities, Provincial Governments, and Ministries must be effectively utilized.
“We must ensure that every kina we allocate is used for development. We cannot afford delays or mismanagement. I do not expect miracles, but I do expect results. Wherever funding has been provided, work must be taking place—in the districts, in the provinces, and our ministries. We all have to serve.”
The Prime Minister reminded Governors and District MPs that they hold a full five-year mandate to implement meaningful change, whereas the Office of the Prime Minister is subject to the political realities of the 18-month grace period.
“Governments may change, but development must not stall. Districts and provinces must continue delivering long-term improvements that align with our National Government’s Medium-Term Development Plan. There can be no excuses for stagnation,” Prime Minister Marape said.
He said accountability is essential and that public servants, government agencies, and leaders must ensure that projects are completed efficiently and transparently.
Prime Minister Marape highlighted that under his leadership, the Government ensured all districts— whether aligned with the Government or the Opposition—received equal and fair funding:
• K10 million in District and Provincial Services Improvement Programme funds
• An additional K5 million in Special Infrastructure Grants
“That is K15 million per district as the baseline allocation. We will also look at matching district and provincial priorities with a Kina-for-Kina policy. Additionally, my government will tailor an extra fund to cover the cost of service delivery for remote rural districts.
“We will set up a National Monitoring Authority to ensure all development funds are expended in line with government priorities and deliver maximum results.”
“One day, we too will be carried on the shoulders of our youth and laid to rest in the land of our birth. What legacy will we leave behind?”
“The people are watching. The nation is waiting. Let us honour those who built this country by delivering meaningful change for the future of Papua New Guinea. Time is short—we must act now.”"
Cancer referral systems need improvement,09/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3125,"There is an urgent call to improve the referral pathway for patients diagnosed with Cancer.
This was the call by the Director of Public Health, Dr Amos Lano, attached under the NCD Provincial Health Authority. He stressed the improvement of the health referral systems due to the growing number of Cancer patients in the country.
In commemorating Cancer Day recently, and addressing the challenges faced by the country against the killer Cancer disease, Dr Lano also called for more awareness this year.
“We must screen our patients early, that's the work of the public health team. So, this year, we have decided to revive our Mobile programs. We will be sending our teams to all the settlements, the big villages in Motu Koita, the marketplaces, and even the office environment.”
He said people needed to understand that early cancer detection is very important in making sure someone is free of Cancer, and early treatment can save lives.
Apart from increasing awareness, Dr Amos said the referral system needs to be improved in the country to improve the flow of patients and allow better treatment and results.
“We want to strengthen the referral system so that our patients can get early treatment, and if so we can diagnose.”
Furthermore, Dr Lano shared that the country’s challenge now is the lack of Oncologist. An Oncologist specializes in diagnosing and treating cancer.
Dr Lano said with the increase in cancer patients more specialists are needed for PNG’s fight against cancer.
“The key message to the National Health Department is we must look at training more doctors, even more helpers and technicians. We have the latest machines and facilities coming into the country, but we want local people to run those facilities.”"

Guidelines launched to safe guide PNG waters,08/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3114,"The Department of Justice and Attorney General, Office of Oceans Affairs, and the Department of Foreign Affairs have launched the revised Marine Scientific Research Guidelines 2024 on Thursday, February 06th,  in Port Moresby.
The Papua New Guinea government adopted the revised Marine Science Research (MSR) Guidelines, marking a significant step forward in the country’s commitment to sustainable ocean management and the well-being of our people.
The guidelines including the National Oceans policy implementation plan 2024-2030 were approved by NEC on December 18th, 2024, marking a significant step in ocean governance and protection.
The program is chaired by DJAG and core chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, they are members of the Marine Scientific Research Committee. These entities work together to ensure that the ocean space is properly protected and governed under relevant laws and policies.
According to the Minister for Justice and Attorney General Pila Niningi, all relevant authorities must seek the consent of the Marin Scientific Research Committee to issue an exploration license for mining and petroleum. This will protect the ocean and marine environment from exploitation and risk to the marine environment.
DJAG Secretary Dr Erick Kwa further stated that launching of the guidelines is a milestone achievement for the people, especially for the coastal communities, the 600-plus islands, and the 15 maritime provinces.
“It is important to protect our ocean and marine life and to use it sustainably for the benefit of the people, the country and the future,” Kwa said.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Justin Tkatchenko said Papua New Guinea’s economy zone is one of the largest in the world, however, we are in danger of losing our legitimate rights to maritime boundaries and excess maritime resources. Climate change, illegal fishing, and transnational crimes are some of the challenges. However, the implementation of the MSR guidelines, will enhance national security, and support suitable fisheries management, among others.
Meanwhile, relevant authorities whom wish to do research are advise that the application fees have now increased from 3,300 USD to 10,000 USD."

Margis outlined that the National Online Application System, launched in 2017, included non-school leavers last year (2024), hence they are anticipating an increase in applications from non-school leavers.
“This is addressing the government’s policy position on ‘Take back PNG’, quality access to higher education and allowing other students access again. That is, if they did not make it the first time, and they did matriculation; there are opportunities and pathways for them.
“In 2025, we do hope to see more non-school leavers apply.”

Sir Julius’ legacy is deeply intertwined with PNG’s nationhood, dating back to 1968, when he led a delegation to the United Nations, advocating that Papua New Guinea was ready for independence. He entered Parliament that same year, joining the pioneering generation that would steer the country toward self-governance and eventual independence from Australia in 1975.
As a founding figure of the People’s Progress Party (PPP), Sir Julius formed a coalition with PANGU Pati in 1972 to prepare PNG for self-government and independence. His role in shaping the country’s economic foundation was profound—he helped establish the Bank of Papua New Guinea and introduced the kina and toea in 1975, overseeing the phasing out of the Australian dollar as PNG asserted its financial sovereignty.
Prime Minister Marape reflected on Sir Julius’ distinguished career, highlighting key moments in his leadership, from his rise as Deputy Prime Minister in the mid-1970s to becoming PNG’s second Prime Minister in 1980—the first leader to ascend to the role through a successful vote of no confidence (VONC).
“He was the first architect of our financial institutions and economy, the founder of our Central Bank, and the man who helped shape the value of our kina,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
“He stood in many of the monumental moments of our nation’s 49-year history and played a defining role in PNG’s place in the United Nations.”
Sir Julius continued to play a critical role in PNG’s political evolution, helping Paias Wingti become the third Prime Minister in 1985 through another successful VONC. He later returned to the prime ministership in 1994, following Wingti’s removal as Prime Minister, further cementing his status as one of the country’s most influential leaders.
His second tenure as Prime Minister was marked by some of PNG’s most defining moments, including leading the country through the devastating Rabaul volcanic eruption in 1994, and presiding over the floating of the kina in 1994, a move that fundamentally changed PNG’s economy. However, his leadership was most tested during the 1997 Sandline Crisis, a moment of political turmoil that led him to step aside for the sake of the nation’s stability.
“He willingly stepped down as Prime Minister in 1997, showing his humility and commitment to national unity,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Few leaders in history have had the wisdom and strength to make such a sacrifice.”
Sir Julius made history once again in 1997, becoming the first sitting Prime Minister to lose an election, a moment that shocked the nation. However, he remained deeply committed to public service and, a decade later, won his way back into politics, becoming the Governor of New Ireland in 2007—a role he held until his passing, championing regional autonomy, economic growth, and social development for his people.
“Sir Julius represented humility, kindness, dedication, patriotism, lawful living, management of time, honesty, tolerance of diverse opinions, and above all, a visionary leader,” Prime Minister Marape remarked.
Prime Minister Marape assured the people of New Ireland that Sir Julius’ contributions will be preserved for generations to come, announcing that Pangu Pati will support the establishment of the Sir Julius Chan Museum in Kavieng to preserve his speeches, writings, and leadership philosophies.
“No monument can truly encapsulate the legacy of Sir Julius, but we will ensure that his wisdom and leadership are never forgotten,” the Prime Minister stated. As Papua New Guinea approaches its 50th anniversary of independence, Prime Minister Marape called on the nation to reflect on the sacrifices and dedication of its founding fathers.
“You and I know some of the conversations we have had,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“I want to say, I am sorry if I have not lived up to your expectations, but we look forward to correcting the past and moving forward for the good of our people.”
As he concluded, the Prime Minister expressed deep sorrow and gratitude for Sir Julius’ lifetime of service.
“Sir Julius, you have set sail on your final journey, and I wish you eternal peace as you find.
He reassured the people of New Ireland that the national government stands in solidarity with them, as they mourn and celebrate the life of one of PNG’s greatest leaders.
“I will return when the traditional ceremonies continue for the conclusion of his entire burial process. You will see me back here,” Prime Minister Marape pledged."

UN Women reaffirms support,07/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3089,"UN Women Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific, Christine Arab, concluded a four-day visit to Papua New Guinea, reaffirming the organisation’s commitment to supporting the PNG Government’s leadership in advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment.
The visit took place between 28–31 January 2025, and strengthened partnerships with government officials, Members of Parliament, development partners, civil society organizations, youth organizations and grassroots women’s groups, celebrating PNG’s significant progress while addressing ongoing challenges.
During her meetings with Prime Minister James Marape and with Minister for Community Development, Youth, and Religion Jason Peter, Arab recognized the important investments PNG has made to tackle gender-based violence, increasing women-owned spaces for economic opportunities and enhancing national legal frameworks to ensure women’s equality.
Through discussions with women MPs and Ministers from the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, the visit also highlighted Bougainville’s Gender Equality, Women’s Empowerment, Peace, and Security Policy (2023–2027) as a major achievement in promoting women's leadership.
In partnership with the National Capital District Commission and Governor, Powes Parkop, and the New Zealand High Commission and High Commissioner Peter Zwart, Arab visited Gordon’s Market, a flagship women’s economic empowerment project.
With only 10 percent of women in PNG having access to formal financial services, the Gordon’s Market initiative is crucial in providing women vendors with sustainable economic opportunities, and in which women lead the market’s governance and administration.
Addressing gender-based violence, Arab emphasized the urgent need to strengthen survivor support systems, particularly as 68 percent of women in PNG experience GBV in their lifetime.
UN Women emphasized that they continue to work alongside the government to advance legal frameworks, community-based interventions, and capacity-building for service providers.
The establishment of the National GBV Secretariat was recognized as a crucial step forward in coordinating national response efforts.
This visit reaffirmed UN Women’s commitment to working in close partnership with the Government of Papua New Guinea to drive policy advancements, economic empowerment, and protection for women and girls.

Petty crime rate drop as wardens increase presence,05/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3067,"The increased presence of the city wardens in hotspot areas in Port Moresby has seen a decrease in reported crime.
According to police records, bag snatching has seen a record low since the introduction of the City Wardens initiative in December last year.
Police officers who have been engaged to assist the wardens have seen petty crime rates drop within main shopping centres, markets and bus stops.
Operation Commander Obert Jerry said the main challenge is keeping the bus stop area clean from vendors. He said they are a hard nut to crack and still selling at the main bus stops.
Obert said despite numerous awareness, the vendors are not complying and continue to sell. This has resulted in a few arrests.
To make their job easier, the wardens are working closely to monitor those regular vendors who disobey orders and will be dealt with.
“So far, the wardens are doing a good job and the police management in NCD/Central Command is pleased with. The general public must support the wardens to mitigate lawlessness in the city.”"
Proud computer science student,05/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3066,"Clutching a white slip of paper containing the amount he was expected to pay, Gemmy Pyaki patiently waited with his helper under a marquee set up at the PNG University of Technology in Lae.
The first year student is finally able to register this year thanks to some changes made by Unitech to include students who are using wheelchairs.
Pyaki traveled down to Lae, from Enga Province, on Sunday, February 2nd, to make sure that he gets himself registered to begin his Bachelor of Science studies.
This is not his first time at the Taraka campus.
Pyaki had initially attempted to register at Unitech last year, but because the institution lacked inclusive facilities, he instead signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that ensured his return this year to a more conducive environment.
“Last year I wanted to start schooling but because they didn’t have inclusive facilities, they told me to go back and they will fix them so I can access my classes. That’s why I went back home,” said Pyaki, who hails from Birip village in Wabag. “This year, I aim to take computer science. This has always been my dream.
“I was in a car accident in 2016 and I suffered a spinal cord injury that resulted in an inability to move my arms and legs. I stayed home for some years until I could move my arms again. That was when the thought of holding a pen to write started burning in my mind.
“I sat for an entry exam and passed it, that’s why I’m here,” he proudly beamed.
Unitech’s registrar, Veronica Thomas, said while Pyaki was away, the university utilised that time to modify their facilities. And from their experience with him, they aim to improve and implement action plans to address gender equality, disability, and social inclusion.
“We’ve got a unit all done up for him with features added to help him settle in,” she outlined. “It’s built in a way that he can bring two helpers to help him while he’s here.
“We’ve also arranged for a wheelchair for him and we’ve got a team on the ground to help give him a bit of orientation; an orientation that is different from what the rest of the students undergo. It is to help him see which routes and footpaths he will take. Some of the changes we are seeing are for wheelchair access.
“He’s going to a department that has two floors so we have spoken to the department, so whatever classes that he will be in, they will bring them down to the ground floor.
“We will work through the situation and see what other things need to be done. But we are also working with partners outside to help us work with students like him so that we can give them the best experience.”"

Notorious criminal recaptured,05/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3064,"Kiura Yarti, a 52-year-old former police officer from Koropak village on Karkar Island was recaptured after escaping from Beon prison in Madang early last year.
Yarti had been serving a 32-year sentence for willful murder when he escaped on March 27, 2024. His background as a police officer in Madang Province before committing the murder offense made him dangerous.
This experience likely equipped him with skills and knowledge that enabled him to evade capture for an extended period, raising concerns about his threat to the island communities. Police had received multiple reports of his presence, leading to efforts to relocate him.
After several unsuccessful attempts to recapture Yarti, fresh intelligence finally led authorities to discover that Yarti had traveled by boat from Bagbag Island to Karkar Island. Acting on this information, police tracked him down. Yarti was captured on January 31, when officers stopped a PMV truck and found him among the passengers.
Yarti is in police custody and will be taken to the Beon prison to complete his sentence.
Meantime, Madang Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim appealed to escapees on the run to turn themselves in.

PMGH receives kidney transplant machines,04/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3057,"Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH) is set to make history by offering Papua New Guinea’s first kidney transplant service.
The breakthrough comes after the commissioning of two key machines, the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) and the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Device on January 31, 2025. These machines will eliminate the need to send blood samples overseas, improving efficiency and reducing costs.
The HLA machine is used for compatibility testing between donors and recipients, while the TDM machine monitors immunosuppressive drug levels post-transplant.
Speaking at the commissioning ceremony, Dr. Nora Dai, Acting Executive Manager for Medical Standards at the National Department of Health, praised PMGH’s progress.
“We are on the eve of the first kidney transplantation in the Pacific region. This is a momentous occasion, not just for Papua New Guinea but for the entire Pacific. We are proving that we can achieve what others thought was impossible,” she said.
PMGH Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Paki Molumi, acknowledged the National Fisheries Authority for its K10 million funding towards the kidney transplant program.
“By introducing a kidney transplant program, we can free patients from dialysis machines, allowing them to live a more economical and independent life,” Dr. Molumi said.
He further noted that the kidney transplant service would be extended to neighbouring Pacific nations, reducing the need for patients to travel to countries like Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines. This move, he said, aligns with the government’s vision of promoting medical tourism to boost the economy.
Dr. Molumi also highlighted the remaining challenge of finalising the kidney transplant policy and legal framework, with the aim of performing the first transplant as a Golden Jubilee gift to the people of Papua New Guinea."

Pariwa asked to pass budget,04/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3052,"Sector heads in Madang Province are unable to deliver on projects because the 2025 budget has not been vetted through a Provincial Executive Council meeting, of which Governor Ramsey Pariwa is chairman.
The public machinery has not been able to perform its duties since commencing the working year, because of a lack of resources and logistics.
Constant pressure from district heads and authorities has forced the head of the public service in Madang, Frank Lau, to call on the Governor to recognize the urgency.
Deputy Governor, Corporate Service Dick Moiga said in the past couple of years, the budget process was hijacked by the Administration resulting in two sets of budgets being presented to Treasury. This has seen a tussle for the implementation of the budget and budget maintenance processes.
Furthermore, Mr. Moiga stated that the budget is the bloodline for service delivery and it would be detrimental to the people of Madang if services are not rendered as anticipated.
David Turik the Planning Director emphasized maintaining system processes and governance for effective service delivery.
According to the three, the last lot of Form 11 claims from 2024 are yet to be signed by the Governor. The provincial administration hopes this will not be repeated this year against service providers.
Attempts to get the Governor’s comments at the time of writing this report, were unsuccessful. Office staff confirmed he is out of town and unreachable."

RPNGC focuses on housing,03/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3045,"The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) will rehabilitate and build new police accommodations across the country to improve the living conditions of police officers.
Deputy Commissioner and Chief of Administration, Dr. Philip Mitna made this remark at the groundbreaking ceremony for 10 new duplexes at Mirane Barracks in Chimbu Province on Friday, January 31st.
DCP Mitna said the Constabulary will build new houses because much of its existing barracks across the country were rundown. One of the primary hindrances to the government initiative is land ownership issues.
“We are ambitious but we are also disappointed after encountering some customary landowner issues along the way, Dr Mitna said.
“The alternative option is to demolish the old and existing houses and construct new buildings.""
""The RPNGC is deeply grateful for the vision and foresight of the Government for allocating direct funding through the Special Police Assistance Program (SPAP), to build and rehabilitate police accommodation throughout the country.""
""We will rehabilitate and build according to the RPNGC standardized building designs, which include brick and steel so the infrastructures can withstand the elements of nature and last for many years, which subsequently minimizes maintenance.”
He said our policemen and policewomen deserve to live in improved barracks accommodation so they can reciprocate the good gesture by putting more effort and commitment into their duties and responsibilities.
“The biggest challenge affecting the RPNGC is the police-to-population ratio. As we continue to increase police numbers through recruitment, we are concurrently focused on improving living conditions, adequately resourcing and properly attiring our members. We have embarked on these programs, much of them would not be possible if it were not for the direct government funding through SPAP,” Dr Mitna."

“From 9am to 12pm, I request that schools and workplaces across the country dedicate this time to honour his memory, reflect on his lasting impact, and acknowledge his contributions to Papua New Guinea,” said Prime Minister in a statement released this evening.
Prime Minister Marape said this period of reflection is a sign of deep respect for one of the nation’s founding fathers, who dedicated over 50 years of service to Papua New Guinea’s governance, economy, and development.

Hunters to pick final team after trials,02/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3042,"Following months of grueling preseason training, the SP PNG Hunters will be hosting their first trial matches this week to assess the progress of its players.
Assistant head coach, Enoch Maki said the trials will be an opportunity for the new Hunters to prove themselves whether they deserve spots in the final 30-men squad.
""We are having our first trial on Friday, 7th February, with Hela Wigmen and Central Dabaris. We are going to select one team; mostly new boys and we see how they go,” said Maki.
He said this would be the first trial for the boys. There will be a second trial which is crucial in selecting the final Hunters team.
""At the end of our second trial against the Central Queensland Carpas, we should be sure of our team for the first round of the competition.""
One of the issues now is the lack of leadership in the team. The Hunters will be without key players, Judah Rimbu and Joshua Lau. Rimbu has signed up his services with the English Super League, and Lau is down with injury.
Despite these losses, Maki believes some brilliant players in the camp are versatile and can cover multiple positions and he is counting on them.
""Our spine, especially with Josh Lau injured and young Felix Beki not 100 percent fit coming back from injury, but there's some good guys in the team.
""Sany Wabo can play multiple positions which is very good. He can play fullback, halves, even hooker. He's very good. We are happy to see how he goes and Morea Junior can play a few other positions as well.""
The assistant coach also threw in the name of versatile Clent Lama who provided a utility role to the team in the 2024 campaign. Maki said Lama is another of those players he plays in multiple positions and still gets the job done.
The Hunters, under coach Paul Aiton and assistant Maki, reached the preliminary final for the first time in the last five seasons. The duo will be looking to go one better this season."

Haiveta pays tribute to Sir Julius,02/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3040,"Gulf Governor and former Deputy Prime Minister to Chan-Haiveta government, Sir Chris Haiveta has expressed his utmost sorrow and sadness at the passing of the late founding father of the nation, Sir Julius Chan.
Sir Chris said the nation has lost one of the last three surviving founding father, just eight months shy of PNG’s 50th anniversary.
“On behalf of the people of the Gulf Province, my provincial assembly, my tribe and the Toaripi tribe where Sir Julius was a co-operative officer at kukup in his early years, I take this time to express my utmost sympathy on the passing of a great iconic leader of Papua New Guinea,” said Sir Chris Haiveta.
“I offer my sincere condolences to Lady Chan, the children and their families. May you find solace and comfort in God at this time of mourning and know that your father has run a mighty race and it is the journey that has been meaningful to each of us in many ways, for which we are eternally grateful.
“As I mourn the passing of Sir Julius, a very close colleague and mentor, I also reflect on his journey from pre-independence to independence then to the present day.
“He was the father and economic architect of the modern post colonial state of PNG. He established most of the institutions that run and regulate the economic and commercial infrastructure of Papua New Guinea.
His Marist boarding college, and Co-operative officer background, training and experience served him well throughout life.
Frugal and sharp, he could uncannily cut through economic jargon and administrative “gobble degook” and  identify savings or an easier and more practical way of doing things. Forever the wiser pragmatist, in politics he was a master strategist of the highest order, playing his steady deck of 4 to 6 MPs and his stature, coming out twice as Deputy Prime Minister to Wingti and twice as Prime Minister unseating Somare and Wingti in his heyday.
Punctuality and comportment and good manners were important in day to day affairs of the state, be they meetings, formal and informal or Ministerial NEC meetings. As a bureaucrat he was a hard taskmaster but a pleasure to work with.10 am meant 10 am with 100 % attendance not 10 past 10 am with 99% attendance.
“Late Sir Julius and I go a long way back when he was the prime minister and I was Secretary Gulf in the 80s and later as Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in the mid 90s. Together, we faced challenges, recorded successes and set up institutions that have added value, all for the good of our people and  this nation.”
At times, we found our selves on opposite sides of the House but our tight bond in  personal relationships have remained until the end with our lines open to each other all times.
He was a man of his word. A true friend.
“Farewell Sir J, rest easy now as you have played your game well for us all. For today we remember you. Your legacy lives on. May you rest in peace."""

When expressing his condolences on the passing of Sir Julius Chan, at the launch of the 50th anniversary in Port Moresby recently. The Prime Minister strongly urged young people to learn from these great leaders and lead the country forward.

“They dreamt of a sovereign country, and in 1975, the young, mostly not equipped with the university degrees that we have today came together and forged the most diverse nation into one sovereignty we have today.
“There were fights that you never saw and tears that you never saw. There were moments of struggle that you were not part of that construct the freedom of this country that these great men made.”
Marape stressed that the country’s forefathers have done their part and it is now this generation of leaders to unite the country and carry on their legacy.
“They have passed on this country to us, and it is our business. As soon as they pass it on to us, it is our business to pass it on as a United Progressive nation into the future.
“Our economy must grow and no child must be left behind.
“Everyone must have access to money and healthcare. And everyone must respect each other. Those were the dreams of Sir Julius. Those were the dreams of Sir Michael Somare.”
“What is it that you must do to appreciate those who forged this unity and went before us? Marape challenged the current young leaders.
He reiterated that this generation must not squander the opportunity for us to construct a better future for this country.
“John FK once told his country, ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. It is not a hard ask. It is easy to ask what you can do for your country. The country is not abstract. Not a concept, but it is a living organ, a body that stands to call for those of us who said to set better be 100 percent committed to the cause.”
