Jiwaka Leaders Call For Action As Writs Return Date Looms,15/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6868,TVWAN,Politics,Anticipation,Soroi Eoe,"Community leaders from wards within the Anglimp and Kuna Komun Local Level Governments (LLGs) of Jiwaka province are calling on the PNG Electoral Commission (PNGEC) to conduct their delayed elections before the deadline of November 21st.
Their appeal follows a recent letter from the Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, Soroi Eoe, addressed to the PNG Electoral Commissioner. In the letter, Minister Eoe concurred with the Electoral Commissioner’s request for an extension of the deadline for the return of writs for some LLGs due to special circumstances, citing Sections 277(2)(b) and 288(2) of the Organic Law on Provincial and Local-level Governments.
The Minister explained that while many LLGs across the country have progressed well, some experienced delays due to various issues and require additional time to complete their elections. He however, advised the Electoral Commissioner to return the writs for the completed LLGs to his office on November 21, 2025.
Councilors Peter Saina, Joe Win an Kerewa Mekenti of Anglimp and Kuna Komun are now urging the PNGEC and Jiwaka’s Election Manager to proceed with the elections without further delay. They are also calling for the return of the official writs by the end of next week to ensure timely completion.
The delays for these LLGs were initially caused by confusion surrounding the creation of new wards. However, leaders have confirmed that the new wards for Anglimp and Kuna Komun are legal and have followed all required procedures. They also emphasized that no court orders prevent them from voting.
The creation of the new LLGs—Anglimp, Kuna Komun, and Kambia—was approved by the Provincial and Local Government Affairs Office to support the upcoming split of Anglim South Waghi into two separate electorates in 2027. While the Kambia LLG elections have already progressed and declarations have been made, only Anglimp and Kuna Komun remain delayed.
The community leaders are firm in their stance that these the election for these two LLGs should proceed to ensure they exercise their democratic rights to choose their leaders."
SHMS Multipurpose Hall Unveiled,15/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6862,TVWAN,Education,Joy,James Marape,"The School of Medicine and Health Sciences at the University of Papua New Guinea opened its new multi-purpose school hall yesterday.
The school is on its way to becoming the new University of Medicine and Health Sciences after Parliament passed the legislation last month, enabling its inception. The multipurpose hall is the first of several buildings in the project’s phase 1 plan.
Prime Minister James Marape when officiating at the event thanked those who have worked hard to bring about this infrastructure development.
“I want to thank the University of PNG and Chancellor, Sir Robert Igara, and the Executive Dean of the Medical Faculty, Prof. Nakapi Tefuarani, for working very hard to make this small but important milestone and a pointer, a moment in our nation’s history to remind us of what can be done if we work together in the direction we must take travelling forward,” said Prime Minister Marape.
Highlighting the need for SMHS to be granted a stand-alone university of its own, the Prime Minister set a timeline on when he wants the institution to be fully functional.
“UPNG, let this campus go. This country needs its own medical university. The statistics is compelling – the doctor-to-patient ratio in Papua New Guinea is among the lowest in the world. For 10 million people, we now need up to 10,000 doctors to be on par with world levels.
“This is why it is of the utmost importance to get this university up at the earliest, and I give to you our government’s fullest commitment to getting this university up as soon as possible.
Before we step out into the 2030’s, this campus must be fully functional to meet the needs of our country going forward.
“We hope as we set up the new university, enrolment increases, vacancies are filled, and we get to employ enough doctors in the country and send doctors and medical practitioners out to our region.”
The Prime Minister said he sees the strong value of having the medical university independent of the University of PNG and functioning symbiotically with the Port Moresby General Hospital – both because of their physical location next to each other and professionally because of the relationship of the work they do.
He said his government is determined to upgrade PMGH to a Level 7 status hospital as it develops the new university to its highest potential.
“Port Moresby General Hospital is in a symbiosis with this university. Our government will invest heavily in the cancer facility and soon we will open this facility which will be the best cancer treatment facility in the Pacific, comparable to Australian standards.
We have stepped up on the heart facility. We witnessed the first heart bypass in 50 years. And I witnessed the first two successful kidney transplant, another first for our country.
“Our government will keep investing in PMGH to take it to a Level 7, fully-run specialist hospital as well as embracing general duties for the rest of the country.
“Utilising latest technology, this university will train highly qualified Papua New Guineans to serve all the needs in our country,” said PM Marape.
The University of Medicine and Health Sciences project is a national project. It began after an NEC decision was taken in 2017 but delayed when the former UPNG council went to court challenging the decision to stop the splitting of UPNG.
Project restarted after Sir Robert took chancellorship of UPNG and Prime Minister Marape resumed the momentum to install a separate university that would concentrate on producing doctors and medical practitioners to fill the wide gap in the health sector in the country.
It is estimated it will take up to three years to get the new university functioning from completion of all building infrastructure to transferring the administrative functions from UPNG, and taking enrolments."
"‘You can be billionaires’, small-scale miners told",15/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6861,TVWAN,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"Small-scale miners in Papua New Guinea have the potential to become billionaires if they make sound investment decisions, diversify into other businesses, and manage their earnings responsibly.
Managing Director of Mineral Resources Authority (MRA) Jerry Garry. made these remarks in Wau on Thursday, November 13, during celebrations marking the 15th anniversary of MRA’s Small-Scale Mining Training Center (SSMTC).
About 3,000 people including miners, Wau locals, and stakeholders gathered to commemorate the milestone.
In his address, Mr Garry shared a motivational story about Placer Dome, one of the world’s largest gold mining companies, which began its journey, mining alluvial gold in Wau.
Historical records show that in 1926, two expatriates—an Australian and a New Zealander—discovered abundant gold resources in Wau-Bulolo. They established Placer Development Proprietary Limited, raised funds, and purchased eight dredging machines to mine the Wau-Bulolo goldfields. Importantly, they did not limit themselves to gold mining, they diversified into cattle farming, fishing, and forestry. The pine trees harvested today by PNG Forest Products in the Wau-Bulolo area were first introduced by these men as part of their diversification strategy.
After more than five decades, Placer Development Proprietary Limited acquired a mining license to operate the Porgera mine. The company later merged with Dome to form Placer Dome. By 2005, Placer Dome operated 16 gold mines across seven countries and had a market capitalization of USD 6.7 billion.
The MD encouraged miners to follow this example, stressing that with wise investments and careful management of profits, they too could become billionaires."

This year, the PNG SME Awards marked the introduction of the inaugural Yumi Stap Wantaim Award, sponsored by the Australian Government through the PNG–Australia Partnership. The award is designed to celebrate SMEs in Papua New Guinea that demonstrate strong business growth and resilience – in terms of turnover, market share, and profitability – and also exemplify the values of partnership, community engagement, and service. This award comprises a value of PGK15,000: a cash prize of PGK5,000 and PGK10,000 in tailored business development support.
Australian High Commission representative, Acting Minister Counsellor Richelle Turner, presented the award to Chef Nicky Pohonhelan.

In accepting the Yumi Stap Wantaim Award, Mr Pohonhelan, thanked the Australian Government.
“As an SME out there, right now I’m thinking of what kind of stove am I going to get, what kind of oven am I going to get. I appreciate the Australian Government for giving me this opportunity to basically wonder how else I can grow my business, because there has been plans, but the issue was finance,” he said.
Australia continues to supports Papua New Guinea’s MSME sector through initiatives that provide business training, access to finance, and practical support including:
•	the largest-ever survey of PNG’s MSME sector, with over 2,600 businesses across 21 provinces sharing insights to inform responsive programs;

The Australian Government remains committed to supporting Papua New Guinea’s entrepreneurs and strengthening the SME sector as a cornerstone of inclusive and sustainable economic growth."
PNG Chief Censor Raises Alarm Over AI 'Theft' of Local Music,14/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6857,TVWAN,Technology,Fear,Nill,"Chief Censor of the Office of Censorship of Papua New Guinea, Jim Abani, has raised an alarming issue: the unauthorized transformation of PNG's local, authentic music into Artificial Intelligence (AI) versions. Mr. Abani warns that this practice constitutes a significant copyright breach and is ""draining the future"" of the country’s music industry.
The alleged copyright breaches emerged this year, with familiar songs from veteran artists being remixed and distributed as AI-generated tracks. It has come to the attention of Mr. Abani’s office that original music created and sung by Papua New Guinea's local artists has been transformed by unknown creators into AI versions.
According to Mr. Abani, this practice is a breach of copyright laws because the AI output is ""substantially similar"" to the original works. He stated that local artists face a genuine threat to their artistic products going forward.
Mr. Abani emphasized the importance of preserving the country's artistic integrity, adding that all original content including videos, music, and other creative products must remain authentic to promote PNG's genuine artistic identity.
Familiar local songs already being transformed into AI versions include ""Madang"" by Demas Saul and ""Asua"" by Edwin Baffe.
To combat this growing threat of copyright infringement, Mr. Abani strongly advocates for an ""all-of-government approach"" as the only viable way to assist local artists.
“I strongly believe that an all-of-government approach is the only way that we can assist our local artists. Regulating AI music in Papua New Guinea requires a phased approach,” he stated.
He identified key strategies to help local artists and called on relevant agencies to act:
•	Copyright Law Review: ""If it is outdated, we need to review that.""
•	Licensing and Royalties: ""We have to establish this licensing so that they can benefit those music artists."
Forest body urged to implement ban of round logs,14/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6852,TVWAN,Environment,Disgust,Nill,"Environment NGO, ACT NOW PNG doubts the National Forest Authority’s ability to implement the Prime Minister’s commitment to end the export of round logs by 2025.
ACT NOW Campaign Manager Eddie Tanago while congratulating the PM for his declaration, outlined instances in the past where NFA has not implemented decisions made by previous governments.
“The PNG Forest Authority has an appalling record when it comes to following the law and implementing government policy” says Eddie Tanago.
“The Prime Minister’s reputation and the reputation of our nation is now on the line, as the whole world will be watching to see if the promise is upheld.”
In 1991, the new Forestry Act which created the PNGFA, replaced the concept of the Timber Rights Purchase and Local Forest Area with a new type of logging licence, the Forest Management Agreement. Yet over thirty years later, less than 15% of log exports come from FMA areas and the TRP and LFA still dominate the sector.
The government’s Vision 2050 banned log exports from 2010, a ban that was endorsed by the then Prime Minster, Peter O’Neill in 2008. Yet in 2010 log export volumes reached record highs and in 2015 PNG became the world’s largest exporter of tropical logs.
In 2018, the O’Neill government promised log exports would end by 2020; a pledge that was repeated by the new Marape government in in 2020, Prime Minister Marape made a new pledge that there would be no new export licences issued but within two years, twenty new export logging projects had started up.
Then, in Nov 2022, the National Forest Board imposed a moratorium on the issuing of new Forest Clearing Authorities.
Yet in 2023 and 2024 there were five new FCA projects that started log exports.
Eddie Tanago says he hope his pessimism is proved wrong and that the PNG Forest Authority can step up and break the cycle of history by ensuring there are no exports of round logs from January 2026.
“Hopefully now is the time the Forest Authority can show a different face and ensure the Prime Minister’s promise to the world is fulfilled”, says Tanago."

Manning stated that, despite isolated challenges, particularly in the Highlands region, police will maintain their presence and support the Electoral Commission in conducting the election.
“There have been isolated incidents in the upper highlands, and there have been ongoing tribal fights that have impacted the smooth running of LLG elections in certain districts and electorates.
We will continue to support the electoral commission, ensuring that the democratic process is completed, which does present its challenges as well.
“Mainly, Southern Highlands and Enga have continued to pose significant challenges for us and the electoral commission, but this is electoral commission business; we are just supporting with security. We will advise the electoral commission on whether or not the environment is conducive to safely running the election and make the call to discontinue polling in any part of the country if the environment is not conducive,” he said.
The commissioner further urged everyone to follow the democratic process of voting and refrain from conflicts."

Biliau Primary School commended,14/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6848,TVWAN,Education,Joy,Ramsey Pariwa,"The Board of Management and the teaching staff of Biliau primary school in the Raicoast district of Madang province have been applauded for their efforts, leading to the completion of an impressive double classroom project within schedule and budget.
Governor for Madang, Ramsey Pariwa, praised the school during the official opening of the new learning facility which was funded by the Madang Provincial Government at a cost of K100, 000 through the Provincial Services Improvement Program (PSIP) fund.
Pariwa was impressed as funding for this project was only released mid this year to a number of schools to assist in infrastructure projects such as classrooms and teachers houses but most are yet to complete theirs.
""Biliau is the third school to have successfully completed its classroom project upon receiving funding and I want to thank the head teacher, the school board and the contractor for working together in collaboration,"" Pariwa said.
""That's the way it should be. We should put our differences aside and work together hand in hand to see productive results not only in education but also in other sectors,” he added.
Madang Education Advisor, Alphonse Igag outlined how his office is driving policies set out by the provincial government.
""We at the Madang Provincial Education Division and the Administration are happy that the Governor is pushing for us to come up with proper systems and ways which the government and the administration is supposed to run in the province,"" Mr. Igag said.
Mr. Igag urged the teaching staff, the board and students to look after school infrastructure whilst encouraging parents and teachers to set standards and ethical values in the school and community and be role models to the students to see positive change going forward.
Head Teacher Siloi Dimas, when presenting a brief report of the project completion, thanked Governor Pariwa for the support, adding that the school looks forward to working alongside the Madang Provincial Administration to deliver more projects."

The students reached Lae on Tuesday evening, and were accommodated at the Lae Secondary School.
Classes at UOG were suspended for two weeks following an incident at Ato Market, in Goroka, between a student and a group of intoxicated locals, sparking a confrontation that started on Saturday, November 8th, 2025, and continued to Sunday morning, ending at around 4pm.
The University of Goroka’s Yangoru-Saussia student association president, Sebron Yembihahu, outlined that aside from injuries and damages to property, students were traumatised and had to leave campus for fear of their safety.
This is not the first time students have been attacked by locals, hence, while waiting for word from their provincial administration, the East Sepik students followed their Morobean counterparts to Lae.
“We arrived in Morobe last night (November 11th),” said Yembihahu. “The first group arrived at 7pm and the second group arrived around 10pm.
“We were catered for here at the Lae Secondary School, where we spent the night.
“From Lae secondary, they have relocated us and we will be moving to Bugandi Secondary School, where we will remain there until Sunday, when we should be heading back to East Sepik Province.”
The second-year bachelor of science student drew attention to the fact that they were into their second week of examinations when the incident happened.
The university confirmed that approximately 75 percent of examinations have already been completed, with the remaining 25 percent to be conducted online in two weeks’ time for Years 1 to 3 students.
“The vice chancellor said we are going to do our exams online, through Google classroom and the date for the examinations is 24th-29th November. During that time, all students will go online and do their remaining exams.”
Meantime, Governor Allan Bird said the East Sepik Provincial Government is grateful to Lae MP, John Rosso, Morobe leaders and the people of Morobe for their assistance in moving their students to Lae.

Doctors Bring Health Services to YUS,13/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6834,TVWAN,Health,Trust,Nill,"The Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program (TKCP) has welcomed seven international doctors and health professionals from the United States to Papua New Guinea’s YUS Conservation Area this week, marking another milestone under its One Health program.
The visiting team will spend a week in YUS providing vital medical education, health checks, and community awareness sessions focused on improving the wellbeing of rural communities. This year’s visit, coordinated by TKCP’s One Health Partnerships Coordinator Roseylita Opa, focuses on maternal and physical health, with specialists in obstetrics, gynaecology, and physiotherapy joining the mission.

Bureaucratic red tape blamed for slow release of funds to MaPHA,13/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6844,TVWAN,Health,Anger,Robert Naguri,"The Parliamentary Advisory Committee on Health has been told that a K15 million funding for Madang Provincial Health Authority has been sitting in Waigani for more than two years pending approvals.
MaPHA Chief Executive Officer, Martin Daimen revealed this when asked by the advisory committee why this money has not been utilized while health infrastructure in the province deteriorate.
The Committee conducted a two-day inquiry in Madang this week and took an interest in the K15 million currently sitting in the MaPHA trust account and has not been accessed in the last two years.
Chairman of the Committee and Member for Bogia, Robert Naguri led the inquiry, taking the MaPHA CEO to task over the delay in drawing these funds.
The CEO in explaining the delay, outlined the process involved in accessing this money. He said in order to access the funding, MaPHA had to submit its plans for vetting and deliberation to the Project Steering Committee which is made up of Treasury, National Planning and the Prime Ministers departments. He revealed that MaPHA has been waiting ever since the submission as the PSC keeps deferring.
In response, Naguri said, ""This is not good enough, we think we are doing the right thing, but we are not. In the process of waiting, lives are lost, and we keep moving backward. We've got to move forward and deliver the best patient care and service to the people, that is our primary role,"" Mr. Naguri emphasized.
Appalled by this process, Naguri said he would personally pay a visit to the Ministers for Health and National Planning and ask them to release the money immediately.
As a level 5 hospital, Mr. Naguri stated that the infrastructure and environment of the hospital is not conducive and it is disheartening to see that there is no proper emergency building as the former building is still under construction and currently a ward is being used for emergency cases with patients scattered around waiting to be attended to.
Toilets are closed with only one ablution block containing four bathrooms and toilets for males and females each, currently being used for the entire hospital.
The morgue chillers are in need of maintenance with dead bodies kept refrigerated containers at freezing temperatures.
Another serious concern raised by the Committee affirming the need of K15 million was that most of the infrastructures still had the toxic asbestos, which needs to be changed immediately.
The inquiry is an extension from Morobe's Angau Memorial Hospital last week."
Goilala Teachers gain skills in inclusive and effective teaching,13/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6846,TVWAN,Education,Trust,Nill,"More than 86 teachers from Goilala in Central Province have strengthened their skills and confidence in the classroom.
A recent training led by the Central Provincial Division of Education, in collaboration with the Catholic Diocese of Bereina, National Department of Education and Australian funded Partnerships for Improving Education program, showed them the importance of including every child in teaching and learning.
Kanansio Kito, the teacher-in-charge at Kerau Primary School, who has been teaching there for 14 years, says it opened his eyes to drawing on policies more efffectively.
“Before this session, I did not know much about GESI and WASH. I am now ready to implement these new policies,” Mr Kito said.
For Francis Paru, who has taught in Kivori Primary School for 11 years, the training was transformative.
“The training showed me how to maintain a safe and hygienic environment for both school and community”.
Mr Paru also highlighted that the policies provided practical strategies for preventing the spread of illness and promoting equal participation in class, to ensure every student has the opportunity to learn.
The policy in-service supported by Australia’s Partnerships for Improving Education program has reached over 700 teachers and almost 100 trainers, who are education officials.

UOG SRC Calls for Security Fencing and Dorm Repairs,13/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6841,TVWAN,Education,Fear,Robert Atiyafa,"The University Council of the University of Goroka (UOG) has resolved to commission an independent investigation to establish the real cause of the continuous disturbances caused by members of the surrounding communities.
According to a statement released from the Vice Chancellors office, it stated that repeated conflicts and disruptions have caused instability and great fear among the students and staff, even resulting in several deaths.
Vice Chancellor Dr. Teng Waninga (PhD), whilst informing the National Government, the Department of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, parents, guardians, sponsors, and the general public, said the recent clash was stressful and undermined the main focus of providing quality teacher trainings program in a more secure and peaceful environment.
The students, through their Student Representative Council, appealed to the National Government, local members, and the top management to give immediate attention and priority in funding a permanent perimeter fencing, construction of additional dormitories and maintenance of damaged dormitories for student lodging. They appealed to have those safety measures in place before the commencement of 2026 academic year so as to avoid further confrontations in future.
Students have been living in the surrounding communities after dormitories were damaged during an earthquake in 2022.
Around 51 students were reportedly injured during the fighting and received medical attention at the Goroka General Hospital. Most of them have since been discharged while five students remain in critical but stable condition.
It was also reported that several staff houses were destroyed and personal valuables stolen. The Vice Chancellor stated that the university will provide financial assistance to staff who were affected.
Police from Simbu and Western Highlands are currently providing security and maintaining stability in and around the campus and will remain there imdefinitely.
""On behalf of the council, top management team, staff, students and sponsors, I would like to pass my sincere gratitude to Kinoka Feo, Robert Atiyafa, and local leaders and the Okiufa community who assisted in bringing normalcy to the University. We also appreciate the police minister and Commissioner for arranging mobile squad members to provide security on campus. We also thank the Defense Force from Igam Barracks who dispersed the crowd and took control of the situation. We also thank the Governors and elected leaders for funding transportation of students to their various destination,"" stated the VC."

Remembering PNG’s Role in WWI and Beyond,12/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6827,TVWAN,History,Trust,Nill,"On Tuesday 11th of November, an Armistice Day commemoration ceremony was held at Bomana War Cemetery in Port Moresby.
Armistice Day, also known as Remembrance Day, commemorates the end of the Great War (World War I), the signing of the Armistice. The ceremony included a minute's silence at 11am, marking the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, the moment when guns fell silent across the Western Front and the war ended.
Armistice Day pays respect to those who lost their lives in all wars and conflicts.
In his Armistice address, Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea and Special Envoy to the Pacific, Ewen McDonald, spoke to the significance of Papua New Guinea in WWI for Australian soldiers.
He said “perhaps the most familiar names linking war and Papua New Guinea (PNG) to Australians are the Kokoda trail and the Coral Sea from the Second World War. However, New Guinea was the site of the first Australian battles and deaths in the Great War.”
New Guinea was the site of Australia’s first successful combat action in WWI, resulting in the taking of an enemy occupied radio station in Rabaul, East New Britain.
Visiting Australian Defence Force Chaplain Lieutenant Colonel Michael Folland recited 'In Flanders fields', a poem which speaks of the red poppies, the first plants that sprouted from the devastation of the battlefields of northern France and Belgium. The Flanders poppy has become the flower of remembrance worn on Armistice Day.
The commemoration ceremony was attended by visiting Commander of the 1st (Australian) Division, Major General Ashley Collingburn, Australian Defence Adviser Colonel Nicholas Trotter, and several diplomatic and Defence representatives."

Gov’t and Civil Society Unite in Brazil to push for Climate Justice at COP30,12/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6820,TVWAN,Environment,Anticipation,"Gary Juffa, Salio Waipo","Papua New Guinea is making its presence felt at COP30 in Brazil, with both government leaders and civil society groups calling for urgent, community-driven climate action rooted in Indigenous leadership and rainforest protection.
The main COP30 negotiations run from 10 to 21 November, with PNG’s team actively participating in high-level talks and side events.
“Our forests are not just carbon sinks - they are homes, heritage, and hope for our people,” said Environment Minister Simo Kilepa, who joined the delegation alongside Forest Minister Salio Waipo, Northern Governor Gary Juffa, and senior officials from CCDA and CEPA.
At the same time, PNG’s leading civil society organizations - under the Papua New Guinea Environment Alliance (PNGEA) - issued a powerful joint statement demanding climate justice that centers Indigenous rights, ethical finance, and transparent governance.
“This is a collective voice for the people of PNG,” said PNGEA Coordinator Pamela Avusi. “We are calling for climate justice that is rooted in the practical realities of our local communities.”
Key Demands and Diplomatic Priorities include,
- Indigenous Peoples as equal decision-makers in climate finance, not just beneficiaries
- Full operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund, with grant-based, accessible support for frontline communities
- Stricter safeguards against corporate greenwashing in carbon markets
- Transparent governance of climate funds through PNG’s Biodiversity & Climate Fund
- Increased benefit-sharing for rural forest stewards
- Alignment with Brazil’s bottom-up model of community-led energy and forest transitions
With 97% of PNG’s land under customary ownership, both government and civil society are emphasizing the role of ancestral knowledge in shaping climate solutions.
The government allocated K2 million for travel and logistics, part of a K3 million COP30 budget, with support from development partners.
As COP30 enters its second week, PNG’s unified front - across state and civil society - underscores a growing demand for inclusive, rights-based, and locally led climate action on the world ."
Basic Emergency Care training in ENB,12/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6819,TVWAN,Health,Trust,Nill,"The East New Britain Provincial Health Authority (ENB PHA) is hosting a series of Basic Emergency Care (BEC) courses from the 5th to the 13th November 2025 for emergency care clinicians and frontline clinicians at St Mary’s Vunapope Hospital in Kokopo.
This training comprises two BEC provider courses and one training-of-trainers (ToT) course.
The BEC course was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM). It is designed for first contact providers of emergency care in resource constrained settings and provides a safe and structured approach to managing acutely ill and injured patients.
PNG facilitators from Rabaul, Mendi and Port Moresby, are leading the BEC courses involving over 30 participants and facilitators from three different provinces.
There will be more new master trainers and registered facilitators following the completion of this training. They will be certified to deliver BEC training to first responders and clinicians throughout East New Britain.
The ENB PHA will receive two Laerdal Emergency Learning Laboratory equipment packs, which has been kindly donated by Laerdal Global Health with each containing enough equipment to deliver a 10-person BEC course to continue to train and upskill local first contact clinicians and responders.
These courses are being delivered as part of the Regional Emergency and Critical Care Systems Strengthening Initiative (RECSI), which is supported by the Australian Government through Partnerships for a Healthy Region (PHR). It has also been actively supported by RECSI’s implementing partner for Papua New Guinea – National St John Ambulance PNG – along with the ENB PHA.
This training program is contributing to the World Health Organization’s 25 x 25 Basic Emergency Care Saves Lives campaign, which was launched by the World Health Organization in 2023.
Dr Ignatius Bolokon from the Emergency Department of Rabaul Provincial Hospital, said it is a great opportunity to host BEC course training in East New Britain Province, an opportunity to train their own staff.
“It is such an important course to improve the quality of emergency care services from the Emergency Department at the Provincial Hospital to the local health centres out in the peripheries. Most of the participants are coming from the peripheral health facilities and this course provides the training necessary for them to deliver better emergency care where they are in the rural remote places.
The BEC course is sustainable for us as we will have 10 new BEC trainers trained and we will continue to run this course to build the capacity of emergency care services in the province,” Dr. Bolokon said."

No Alcohol Policy in tertiary institutions imminent,12/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6816,TVWAN,Education,Fear,James Marape,"Following the clash between students and locals at the University of Goroka that has now led to the suspension of classes, Prime Minister James Marape has directed the Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology to explore a “No Alcohol Policy” for students in tertiary institutions across the country.
He appealed for discipline, responsibility, and respect for education in the nation’s tertiary institutions, following recent incidents of student unrest and alcohol-related disturbances at several Campuses.
“Students must focus on their studies. There is time for social life after graduation,” he said. “We want our universities to produce disciplined, ethical graduates who can lead our nation.”
The Prime Minister said the behaviour of a few should not compromise the future of many.
“I apologise to the innocent students, parents, and sponsors affected by these incidents,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Our universities are places for learning and leadership — not disorder.”
He confirmed that the Government is investing over K100 million in Infrastructure at the University of Goroka, with plans to fence and secure the Campus in next year’s Budget to enhance safety and discipline.
Prime Minister Marape appealed to local communities surrounding universities to cooperate with authorities in maintaining peace and security.
“The University of Goroka has been a pillar of education for over 50 years,” he said.
“I call on local tribes and residents to continue supporting the institution and its students. The local community around the University was very hospitable in the past for so long. Lately it is being noted that there are settlements growing around the north Goroka area. I call on those who have settled into Goroka to live like the way Eastern Highlanders or Goroka people do.”
He added that the government will work with  university councils to strengthen student welfare, safety, and discipline, including online learning alternatives where necessary to ensure continuity of study.
“We are proud of our education system and will protect it,” Marape said. “Education is the key to nation-building, and our youth must take this privilege seriously.”
The Prime Minister concluded by reminding all students and citizens that discipline and moral responsibility are the foundations of national progress.
“Papua New Guinea’s future depends on the character of its young people,” he said. “Let us raise a generation that values respect, hard work, and purpose.”"
Government bans round log export,12/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6815,TVWAN,Business,Anticipation,James Marape,"No new round log export licences will be issued after 2025. Prime Minister James Marape revealed this yesterday upon arrival from the COP30 Climate Conference in Brazil.
He reaffirmed his government’s policy to end the export of round logs by 2025 and promote sustainable downstream processing to add value to Papua New Guinea’s forestry sector.
“Our commitment to phase out the issuance of Round Log Export Licences by 2025 remains firm,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“We are now moving towards processing Timber within the country to generate more local employment, stimulate manufacturing, and promote conservation.”
In order to implement this, cabinet has already approved the establishment of PNG Diwai Limited, a state entity mandated to take up to 30 percent of all logs harvested in Papua New Guinea.
This agency will ensure that logs are retained and processed domestically or marketed responsibly under the Forestry Act.
“This policy is not about chasing away investors,” Marape explained. “It is about ensuring that logging operations are conducted sustainably, are environmentally compliant, and that Papua New Guineans share equitably in the benefits.”
This move is consistent with PNG’s climate commitments made at COP30, where the country advocated for the protection of 70 percent of its forests and the establishment of a global financial mechanism to reward forest conservation.
“If we have not shut down fossil fuels, then we must plant or conserve a tree,” he reiterated. “The conservation and sustainable management of forests is the lifeline for our planet.”
Prime Minister Marape called on all forestry companies and industry stakeholders to cooperate with the government in this transition.
He will convene a National Forestry Forum before the end of the year to engage all industry participants on the implementation roadmap for downstream processing.
“The forestry sector has harvested enough over the years,” he said. “Now we must move forward together—industry, government, and landowners—to ensure our forest resources generate wealth for the people while preserving the environment for generations to come.”
Future permits for round logs will require in-country processing or participation in forest conservation and Carbon Credit initiatives.
“This Policy is a moral, environmental, and economic obligation,” Marape said. “Papua New Guinea will lead by example as a responsible Rainforest Nation that values both its trees and its people.”"
Police work in AROB boosted,12/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6829,TVWAN,Security,Trust,Nill,"Law and order in Bougainville has been strengthened following the launch of the Bougainville Police Infrastructure Project (BPIP).
New police stations in Arawa and Buin, as well as upgrades to Buka Police Station will be done under BPIP.
The works, originally valued at PGK 27.5 million and funded under the Australia-Papua New Guinea Bilateral Security Agreement or BSA, align with ABG’s plans to rehabilitate and develop public infrastructure for the delivery of more effective law and justice services.
At the launch, Australian High Commission Minister Counsellor Madeleine Moss said that the funding and resulting infrastructure will lead to better policing outcomes in ABG.
“Australia is pleased to provide this funding to significantly upgrade police station infrastructure in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville. Australia’s funding is part of our long-standing commitment to work with the Government of PNG and the ABG to strengthen security and law and order,” she said.
Australia’s investment in police infrastructure complements investments by Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.
Chief Secretary to the Government of Papua New Guinea, Ivan Pomaleu, announced that the Government of PNG will provide an additional PGK 5 million to police housing.
Pomaleu said that this additional investment was putting more police on the beat in Bougainville.
“The project is timely and aligns with the ABG's plans to rehabilitate and develop public infrastructure for the delivery of more effective law and justice services,” he said.
He also acknowledged the important role of the Minister for Police and Regional Member for Bougainville,  Peter Tsiamalili Jnr. as a key member of the PNG negotiating team for the Bilateral Security Agreement and supporting funding for this project.
New Zealand Deputy High Commissioner Charlie Gillard also announced New Zealand’s intention to refurbish the Police Training Centre in Buka.
The launch was officiated by Chief Secretary to the Autonomous Bougainville Government Kearnneth Nanei and Francis Tokura, Deputy Commissioner and Chief of Bougainville Police.
This investment in modern, purpose-built facilities will enable the Bougainville Police Service to deliver more effective, responsive, and community-focused policing; contributing to better law and justice outcomes for the people of Bougainville."

EU funds local scholars in Environment Conservation,11/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6814,TVWAN,Environment,Trust,Nill,"The European Union through the France Expertise Groupe AFD is sponsoring Papua New Guinean scholars to study different species and aspects of the Environment and its inhabitants for a Masters Degree after two years. The project is funding 21 scholars who are at different stages of their Masters Degree studies.
The programme which started last year is funded under the EU-Forestry Climate Change & Bio-Diversity (EU-FCCB). Each scholar is granted a total of K100,000 per student to study for two years. This funding covers everything from tuition to travels, research and stipend. It is awarded according to a set of criteria including eligibility to study in one of the selected local universities in the country.
The advantage of this scholarship programme is that the scholars don’t need to go far to do their research for the thesis. They do it right here at home because everything they need to study is here including the universities that they are to affiliate to.
During the week of celebrating the green Diplomacy, we had the opportunity to meet three of the students who won scholarship under this programme and they were able to share with us their unique and interesting background. All three were at different stages of the journey into their Masters studies.
Morison Garth who hails from Markham in Morobe and Manus is doing his first year in Master of Philosophy at the Pacific Adventist University.
“The scholarship came out early this year, we all applied for it. I was actually working for some years in the field, I saw this scholarship coming out on Facebook so I told myself that I’ll give it a try, so I applied and then I got selected, out of 130 applicants they only selected 21 of us,  and I was one of them.”
The requirement was to submit a proposal addressing the criteria for the application. Absalom submitted a proposal on micro-plastics along the Motuan Coastline with a plan to study the micro-plastics contaminants in mussels, clamshells, and oysters. He won the scholarship with his prospect changed when he went into the jungles in Madang and encountered the deep and untouched virgin forest.
“We went to Madang for one-month tropical ecology training. All of us went there, it was an exciting, interesting programme. So, we spent a whole one month there. First week we were at Nagada Binatang Research Centre doing a statistics course for Masters students. Statistics is tools to analyze data,” said Absalom.
After that the scholars spent two weeks right in the jungle in the Usino-Bundi district where there is no mobile coverage and no roads – only the sound of birds and insects chirping.
“I think we were lost in the jungle but we were really deep in training, doing ecological studies. In groups the scholars studied different animals, birds and insects like beetles and butterflies and plants.” He added.
Absalom drew inspiration for his final topic for research from comparing the untouched virgin forest to a logging site. Going up in a 45 metres canopy crane, a rare type of machine in the country, they were able to see the whole canopy of the jungle where he could see the gaps left behind by logging.
“When I was up there, I was looking down on the forest and I saw so many beautiful things but then I realized one thing, that there were so many gaps.”
There were nine local landowners who decided to put their forest into conservation in the Usino-Bundi district to preserve their forest. They decided not to allow logging on their land.
“Literally you cannot destroy any trees or plants there because all the trees are numbered. After going in there and observing two different scenarios; logging and conservation and this really made my mind. I must do something on the forest health, so I changed my research. So, I am now studying ‘Forest Conservation’ and I’m studying butterfly as bio-indictors for forest disturbances,” said Absalom.
Absalom is enrolled at the Pacific Adventist University and is looking forward to tackling the second year of master studies.
Plans are in place by EU to introduce this program in the field of Forestry and Environment Conservation because there are none in the country yet."
Police contain Kupiano conflict,11/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6813,TVWAN,Politics,Fear,Nill,"Quick response by police officers from the Central Provincial Police Command has helped contain the fight at Kupiano station in Abau, Central Province today, following a LLG election counting dispute at the station.
Central Provincial Police Commander Chief Inspector Joseph Salle confirmed that the situation at Kupiano station is now under control, and police are currently obtaining information regarding how the fight started, which led to an old man being seriously injured.
PPC Salle stated that Kupiano police officers were quick to respond and despite limited manpower, they managed to contain the situation.
""Two police units from the Central Provincial Police Headquarters and a unit from Kwikila were deployed to contain the situation. The counting for the LLG president that was supposed to commence at Kupiano yesterday was put on hold, awaiting the arrival of police officers from Port Moresby to Kupiano station. We had received information about armed men traveling from Port Moresby to Kupiano station in support of the fight, hence, we are looking into that. Police are communicating with the community to ensure that those who want to take the law into their own hands be arrested and charged,"" PPC Salle said.

"Reckless driving causing accidents, says Manning",11/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6807,TVWAN,Traffic,Sadness,Nill,"Police Commissioner David Manning has attributed the tragic incident at Konedobu freeway that took the lives of three people to reckless driving.
He said many people have died in traffic accidents due to drivers operating irresponsibly without considering the lives of the people they transport and other pedestrians.
“My assessment of that incident after watching the CCTV footage shows that this is reckless driving. If you want to do that, go and do it somewhere else.
“The more reckless you are on the public road, the greater tragedy you pose to yourselves and innocent road users as well,” Manning said.
According to police and media reports, more than ten people have died in less than a month in traffic accidents throughout the country. It all comes back to how each driver drives.
National Capital District Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab also confirmed that the traffic police are working on the fatal accident that happened yesterday.
He said from the Statistics that about four traffic accidents were reported to the police this week.
He stated that this confirms that people are still driving recklessly around the city.
""Our traffic officers are making arrests; people are being convicted, but we still have ignorant individuals who do not think about other road users and the people they carry. We are trying our best to ensure that some accidents are avoided by conducting random police stop-and-search operations, setting up roadblocks, and doing motorist patrols to show police presence. When drivers see police, they tend to drive with care. Police will not always be at locations where you are involved in an accident; look after yourself, the person you are in the vehicle with, and the others on the road.

UOG classes suspended for two weeks,11/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6803,TVWAN,Education,Fear,Nill,"Following the Special Senate Meeting yesterday afternoon, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Goroka verbally addressed the students last night, announcing the suspension of classes for two weeks.
Year 1–3 and first year In-Service Students will take a two-week break and complete their exams online through Google Classroom, WhatsApp, etc., whichever is viable and appropriate.
Year 4 and second year In-Service Students will also go on a two-week break but will return later to complete the semester.
A formal announcement is expected later today where these arrangements and dates will be confirmed.
Following this announcement, the Madang Provincial Government dispatched police and six 25-seater buses for its students, together with two buses from Raicoast DDA and one from Middle Ramu DDA. The buses arrived this morning in Goroka.
However, concerns have been raised that these may not be enough for students and their cargoes, and more busses need to be sent.
Acting Provincial Education Advisor Alphonse Igag indicated that he has been in close contact with student leaders, the Sumkar DDA office, and other appropriate authorities to send more buses for students' evacuation.
""With the six buses going up, I believe there will be some students left behind as it's not enough to cater for students and all their cargoes to come back. I am also appealing to student leaders to make a final list so we know exactly how many students we need to repatriate,"" Mr. Igag stated.
In the meantime, Mr. Igag emphasized the need for university students to be more responsible. He said locals and student clashes are not new and most times occurs at the end of the year and advised students to take responsibility for their own safety.
""Students need to remember that having a good time is not necessary. They need to be responsible and just go back home to their families. This is not a new scenario, and look what it has done? Just because of an outing, millions of Kina costs have been accrued, tarnishing the university's reputation, endangering lives, and causing chaos,"" Igag stressed."
"Power outage did not cause deaths, inquiry finds",11/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6799,TVWAN,Health,Trust,"Lohia Boe Samuel, Ricky Morris, Robert Naguri","The five deaths at the ANGAU Memorial Provincial Hospital, in Lae, were not directly related to the over 20 hours of power outage.
This was the response from members of the ANGAU hospital senior management team during an inquiry that was conducted recently by the Special Parliamentary Committee on Health Matters.
Seven deaths were reported on Sunday, October 19, 2025, when Lae was going through the usual series of blackouts, and the standby generator at the ANGAU Memorial Provincial Hospital failed to kick in.
Of the seven deaths, the Special Parliamentary Committee on Health Matters was told on Thursday, November 6, that two were deaths on arrival.
“In-patient deaths, we had four,” explained the director of curative services, Dr Steven James, to the three-man panel, chaired by Member for Bogia and Chairman of the Special Parliamentary Committee on Health Matters, Robert Naguri.
“The fifth one was someone who came into the emergency department during that time and succumbed to their illness so it was a cubicle death.”
One of the five deaths was described as “cubicle death”, meaning the patient was not admitted but had died whilst at the hospital facility, for example, the accident and emergency bay.
Hence, from the four in-patient deaths, Dr James outlined that the first one was a 73-year-old former public servant who had hypertension, haemorrhagic stroke, and was bleeding within his brain.
“He was admitted on the 16th of October and passed on on the 19th. He was someone who had a stroke and was progressively deteriorating. That was non-preventable,” he explained.
“The second case was a female of 28, who was initially admitted through our labour ward or obstetrics and gynaecology. The next day, she was transferred to the intensive care unit.
“She presented with TB meningitis; TB in the brain. She was also 26-28 weeks pregnant. She was admitted on October 11 into the ICU, and on the 16th, she was diagnosed as already having brain stem death. Prognosis serving team discussed with the family, and it was a case that was slowly succumbing.”
Dr James said the third case was that of a 49-year-old male who was admitted on October 4th with a longstanding history of abdominal pains and headaches. He had disseminated TB, which is a severe form of the illness where the TB bacteria have spread through the bloodstream. He also had other liver issues that were slowly progressing. He was a case of “non-preventable death”.
The fourth case involved a female who was admitted to the mental ward but also had advanced breast cancer that had spread to her brain. She was admitted on September 29 and sadly succumbed to the disease in the early hours of October 19.
The Special Parliamentary Committee on Health Matters, chaired by Naguri, also had Moresby North West MP, Lohia Boe Samuel, and Alotau MP, Ricky Morris, on the panel.
After listening to the ANGAU management and board, Naguri said the committee can confidently report to Parliament that the deaths on October 19 were not caused by the 20-hour blackout."
Police officers injured in Goroka clash,11/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6796,TVWAN,Politics,Fear,John Rosso,"Two police officers have been injured, while two police vehicles were damaged during fighting in Goroka, Eastern Highlands, which started on Saturday November 8, 2025.
During a press briefing today, Eastern Highlands provincial police commander, Chief Superintendent John Kale, confirmed that the conflict escalated after a student from the University of Goroka was attacked by locals from the nearby Apo Market.
“Police were outnumbered when fighting between students from the University of Goroka and locals started on Saturday,” said PPC Kale.
“Fortunately, there was heavy rain that night and that assisted in halting the fight.
“On Sunday, we were all thinking that it was a short fight and it will not happen again but the villagers decided to go into the university and started damaging properties. As a result, students retaliated. Local police were also there.
“Three police officers were stoned, with one of them being admitted currently with a chest injury. The other was hit on the head with a stone and was discharged yesterday. Two of my police vehicles were smashed.”
PPC Kale explained that there was low police manpower in Goroka due to the 2025 Local Level Government elections, where polling was conducted before last week while counting was last week.
“So, all my police officers were deployed to the eight districts. That was why we had low manpower in Goroka.”
The police commander has also refuted claims of locals attacking students who have been admitted to the hospital, saying they have increased security there.
Since yesterday (Sunday, November 9), police numbers have increased on the ground with the addition of Mobile Squad 14 from Kainantu Mine, Police from Simbu, who had arrived at 1pm yesterday, and Mt Hagen personnel, who arrived at 10pm.
Lae MP and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, has assured his electorate that they are in contact with UOG leadership, with the Morobe Provincial Administration, Lae district and Lae police on standby."
Capacity building for HV landowners,11/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6805,TVWAN,Business,Trust,Nill,"Despite many years of having mining companies operate in the country, landowner associations and their business entities continue to suffer from poor leadership, lack of proper management skills, lack of good governance and mismanagement of businesses.
Managing Director of Mineral Resource Authority, Jerry Garry said this has resulted in the unfulfillment of development aspirations of the mine-impacted communities.
With the aim to turn this situation around, the MRA introduced a program to build capacity for landowner associations and their business arms so they can competently manage and better serve their people’s interests.
Thirty project landowner leaders from Hidden Valley Mining successfully completed the two - week leadership, governance and management training from Oct 27-Nov 5 in Port Moresby. This is the second group of landowners, following the successful completion of the same training for Simberi landowners this year.
The program is geared towards enabling the landowners to:
• Gain knowledge and understanding of the roles and responsibilities of Directors
• Develop positive, influential and effective leadership skills, essential for the successful management of NAKUWI, the Hidden Valley landowner umbrella company and equally valuable for Women and Youth groups.
• Enhance financial literacy, including understanding of financial markets and investment principles, relevant to Directors and community leaders.
• And collaboratively align and formulate a Sustainable Development Plan for Hidden Valley (2025–2030), to be developed in partnership with NAKUWI and broader project stakeholders
The program was the first for this group of landowners, was fully funded by the MRA, and delivered by three reputable organizations, namely the PNG Institute of Directors (PNGID), Center for Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI), and the Institute of Banking & Business Management (IBBM). These three organizations delivered important and value-adding aspects and principles of leadership, good governance and business management training.
The program empowered the landowners to provide leadership with appropriate knowledge, mindset, promote and strengthen good governance, and ultimately minimize the potential for fraud, abuse, misuse, mismanagement, and poor governance practices.
The Hidden Valley’s Landowners Association Chairman Wayang Kawa, said most of his members were not adequately or formally educated in managing businesses or organizations. However, he said the training program had empowered them to be able to do better, adding that when they go back to their villages, they would put into practice what they had learnt.
President of the PNGID Clarence Hoot, thanked MRA for funding the program, adding that he hoped that the landowners had been empowered to clearly understand their roles and responsibilities as leaders."

Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, Kinoka Hotune Feo, expressed his frustration and anger at the incident, which allegedly stemmed from an attack on a student on Saturday November 8, by locals at Apo Market.
Students retaliated on Saturday, then the next day, locals entered the campus and continued their assault on students and school properties, at a time when the university was into its second week of examinations.

“I appeal to the nearby villages; Okiufa, Asariufa. The school is in our area. You are good people. This bad behaviour has just started. Youths who consume alcohol must be able to control themselves. If you don’t know how to control yourselves then don’t drink alcohol at all.
“I appeal to the governor of Eastern Highlands; we don’t need alcohol in this province. Completely put a ban on alcohol. We can still survive without alcohol. Nothing good comes out of alcohol.
“According to the report we received, an innocent young man was going to school when he was attacked by a drunkard. Alcohol continues to give us problems because our people don’t know how to consume alcohol.
“Same situation happened in Sonoma in Rabaul. Same weekend. Again, alcohol related. I appeal to our leaders who make decisions in our province.

Pepes finish 3rd at Singapore tournament,9/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6777,TVWAN,Sports,Joy,Nill,"Papua New Guinea came out tops in the battle for third place, outperforming Malaysia to claim a comfortable 69-54 win on Saturday at the Singlife Nations Cup in Singapore.
Kenya maintained their perfect streak to retain the crown, beating Singapore Vandas (2nd) 55-42, PNG (3rd), Malaysia (4th), while development side Singapore A closed in on 5th place, ending their campaign on a high note with a 53-39 win over tournament debutantes the Isle of Man (6th).
It was pleasing news for the PNG side as its co-captain Chloe Litherland was named the Player of the Tournament.
While Malaysia took a while to settle down, PNG were focused from the starting whistle. PNG raced to a 20-12 lead after the first quarter and carried its momentum into the second. World No. 28 Malaysia struggled to penetrate PNG’s staunch defence and could not keep up with their quick counterattacks, allowing PNG to surge further to take a 34-25 lead at half-time.
However, it was the Malaysians who were on the front foot in the third quarter as they found their rhythm to reduce the deficit to just five. They also did well to capitalise on PNG’s mistakes. However, they were unable to replicate their inspired performance in the final quarter.
The reintroduction of PNG shooter Kala Ali was also significant as her work on and off the ball paid off. Ali converted 19 of her 21 attempts in the second half to help her side clinch the win and third place in what was their second time stunning Malaysia this week.
PNG Pepe’s co-captain, Michaela Kadlecek, was proud of the progress her side has made in the past week, especially with just Ali left from the side that reached the 2023 final.
She said: “It was definitely a grind. Malaysia came out firing, but I’m glad we got away with that one. I’m grateful because we really came together today (Saturday). Over the last few days, we’ve played and talked about what we need to work on, and today we’ve pulled it together.
“Our mental fatigue kicked in in the third quarter, and we got a bit tired. But we came off, talked about what we needed to do in that fourth quarter, and we got it together. We're a brand new team, so we're still learning combinations, but we've definitely progressed. We've got some debutantes coming in at 16 years old, and it's really good to see what they can do on the court,” said Kadlecek."

While acknowledging the government’s assistance, Minister Tsiamalili Jr stated that Kairuku District is close to Port Moresby but still lacks government services, which he said is a reality around the country.
He said through the SPAP, the government, right across the country, is making a difference in regard to policing infrastructure, particularly in most rural areas, as the program supports the police officers.
""I want to appreciate my police officers. Continue to serve your country; this is your country. This is a job where you made a decision to join the police force, and you believe in the uniform. We can have many people criticising us, but no one fits into our shoes,” Minister Tsiamili said.
He added that he knows the challenges, and that is why the ministry is trying its best to make sure police infrastructure is looked into. Minister Tsiamalili said police cars are given to increase police presence, and police officers are trained to increase police manpower throughout the country.
Tsiamalili said getting the simple things right, like repatriating the retired officers back home and getting the uniforms for the police officers, are some of the things that are being looked into.
While outlining the things that the government is doing, he also challenged serving police officers to look after the new officers who will graduate and join them in the future, teaching them the good habits that they were taught at Bomana Police College.
Minister Tsiamalili, while commissioning the new infrastructure, thanked the landowners for providing land for the police houses. He also thanked Kairuku MP and Energy Minister Peter Isoaimo, who donated two vehicles to the Bereina police, who are currently using them to do policing in the area."

Contrary to the claims made online, Masere, in a statement, said no such discussions were agreed upon regarding any tender or contract for biometric electronic voting during any recent official engagements.
“The meeting in question focused solely on biometric registration technology to strengthen and expand the current National Identification (NID) system for nationwide coverage.
“At no point did the Minister or any Government representative discuss, approve, or endorse any tender related to the conduct of the 2027 National General Election, nor was any contract awarded to any private company for that purpose.
“All procurement processes for any future projects, including those potentially relating to biometric NID technology and election technology, will be strictly governed by the National Procurement Commission (NPC) under the Public Finance Management Act and relevant tendering requirements.”
He said any claims suggesting otherwise are false, misleading, and irresponsible.
“The public is therefore advised to disregard these unfounded statements. The Government remains committed to ensuring transparency, accountability, and proper due process in all procurement and administrative matters.
“The Ministry will continue its collaboration with the PNG Civil and Identity Registry (PNGCIR), PNG Electoral Commission (PNGEC), and other relevant agencies to strengthen biometric registration for citizens, an essential foundation for service delivery, planning, and good governance.”

“Our engagement with the ICA has provided us with critical insight into the real issues on the ground,” Morris said.
“As we prepare for the inquiry next year, we are committed to identifying practical and effective measures to ensure PNG’s immigration and citizenship processes are fair, secure, and beneficial to our people.
“The committee will come down on illegal foreigners engaged in indigenous and reserved business. All line agencies like the Customs, Labour Department, IRC, and others will be summoned to appear before the Committee.”
During the meeting, ICA officials outlined several strategic measures already underway to address illegal entry, unlawful residence, and compliance monitoring of foreign nationals.
The Committee also expressed concern over reports of illegal immigrants engaging in business activities that are reserved for Papua New Guineans.
Committee Members Lohia Boe Samuel and Dr. Allan Marat joined the discussions, contributing to the Committee’s assessment and planning for the inquiry.
The inquiry, scheduled for early next year, will examine policy frameworks, enforcement mechanisms, and inter-agency coordination to ensure the effective management of PNG’s immigration and citizenship affairs."
PM Marape calls for action on climate financing at COP30,8/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6770,TVWAN,Environment,Anticipation,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape’s call for financing to support forest and ocean nations like Papua New Guinea continued at the COP30 summit in Brazil during the Thematic Session 3: of the Leaders’ Segment.
He called on developed nations and multilateral partners to channel more financing into nature-based solutions that value the preservation of forests rather than their exploitation.
“Our forests deserve proper conservation financing,” he said.
“Nature-based technologies must begin by valuing standing forests — not just harvested timber. One hectare of conserved forest can save the world far more than any industrial offset.”
He urged the international community to deliver a new era of equitable climate finance that recognises the contributions of forest nations to global mitigation, through mechanisms such as jurisdictional REDD+ and carbon market systems under Articles 5 and 6 of the Paris Agreement.
He highlighted the role forest and ocean nations play in “carrying the weight of the planet’s survival” in their fight to preserve the world’s last great carbon sinks.
Prime Minister Marape said the world’s forests and oceans are humanity’s most powerful allies in limiting global warming to 1.5°C.
“Forests and ocean nations are carrying the burden of the entire planet’s atmospheric balance,” Prime Minister Marape said. “The Amazon Basin, the Congo Basin, and the tropical forests of Papua New Guinea and Southeast Asia together form the lungs of the Earth. Conserving them is the greatest mitigation effort we can make to save humanity itself.”
PM Marape reminded delegates that there is no substitute for the Earth’s natural systems, urging them not to look to other planets for survival but to preserve the one they already inhabit.
“There is no planet like Earth,” he said. “Mars and Mercury are unlivable. Here, rivers, trees, mountains, and oceans sustain life. That is worth fighting for.”
PM Marape reaffirmed Papua New Guinea’s commitment to halting large-scale deforestation, restoring degraded lands, and supporting sustainable development for local communities. He also highlighted PNG’s readiness to work with global partners to advance forest-nation diplomacy and operationalise long-term climate financing solutions.
“For six years as Prime Minister, I have been saying: stop deforestation. Bring real conservation that sustains livelihoods and protects humanity,” he said. “If this generation of leaders fails to find real financing solutions for forest nations, history will judge us harshly.”
The Thematic Session on “10 Years of the Paris Agreement: NDCs and Financing” brought together world leaders to reflect on a decade of progress and challenges in implementing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and mobilising climate finance."
Kumuls Duo Land Contracts with London Broncos,8/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6769,TVWAN,Sports,Anticipation,Nill,"Just 24 hours after securing the signature of promising PNG Kumuls utility halfback, Finley Glare, the London Broncos in the Super League, recruited Kumuls fullback Morea Morea Junior.
Morea Junior and Glare will now join fellow PNG Kumuls and former Hunters forward, Emmanuel Waine, at the club under the mentorship of Brisbane Broncos great, Darren Lockyer.
Both Morea Junior and Finley Glare have inspirational stories for young aspiring Papua New Guinean Rugby League players.
Glare, came through the Junior Kumuls system. He starred in their outing against Australian School boys’ team in 2023 where he caught the attention of PNG Hunters coach, Paul Aiton. He was then scouted into the Hunters team in 2024.
Although he made the team, Glare was stuck behind Jamie Mavoko and Joshua Lau, who were regular picks for Aiton. The Hunters went onto making the preliminary finals. Despite not getting many games that season, Glare was sharping his craft in the Digicel ExxonMobil cup with the Lae Tigers waiting for his turn.
The long wait was over when Lau was ruled out for the majority of 2025 season through injury and Mavoko out of form and dropped to Digicel ExxonMobil cup with Port Moresby Vipers. Glare took over the responsibility and never looked back since.
After the Hunters 2025 campaign, he was called into the Pacific Championship camp. He did his job, helped PNG Kumuls retain the Pacific Bowl Title, and won himself a contract with London Broncos – a well-deserved reward for the hardworking young man.
Morea Junior’s story, on the other hand, is a testament of resilience and self-confidence. The electric fullback stayed in the Hunters system much longer than Glare and earned himself a deserving contract with Broncos.
Morea burst into the scene a serious rugby league talent and quickly gain recognition from fans and rugby league community.
He was named best player of the Intrust Super Cup in his debut season (2023). He went on to secure a train and trial deal with The Dolphins the same year. He later signed a similar deal with North Queensland Cowboys in 2025.
What is even more intriguing is that, midway through last year, Morea Junior lost his fullback position to Sanny Wabo after he sustained a serious leg injury that ruled him out for a year. He couldn’t reclaim the spot after recovering from the injury as Wabo locked in the spot.
During the year, Morea Junior transferred to Queensland Capras, after having a stint with Port Moresby Vipers. He was impressive playing for the Capras, hence, PNG Kumuls coach Jason Demetriou entrusted him with the number jumper 1 for PNG Kumuls in the 2025 Pacific Championship. He did his best, showed his potential, and impressed the selectors to secure a contract with the Broncos in the Super League.
All the best to the young men."
Work on Yangoru-Saussia hydro project begins.,8/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6768,TVWAN,Technology,Anticipation,Richard Maru,"The desire by Yangoru-Saussia District to have its own hydro to permanently solve its chronic power issues will soon be over.
The Yangoru-Saussia District Development Authority (DDA) presented a cheque of K353, 200.04 to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Company (SMEC) PNG Limited in Port Moresby on Friday, to commence the prefeasibility study for the proposed Sikau Hydro Project.
Member for Yangoru-Saussia Richard Maru said the payment signals the start of a landmark project and that the DDA is taking action because the district has been without power for up to four months due to continuous power blackouts in the Wewak grid and failing power poles not attended to by PNG Power Limited (PPL).
The estimated project time frame for the entire project will take about 2 years, inclusive of prefeasibility study."

Three beheaded on Karkar Island,7/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6755,,Crime,Fear,Nill,"Karkar Island in the Sumkar District of Madang has been marred with multiple murders overnight with at least three people reportedly beheaded.
Initial reports reaching Madang from sources on the ground indicate that the killings came about following a surprise attack on three youths of Urugen village by youths from another village. The Urugen youths were returning to their village via a bush track when they were attacked. One was reported to have been beheaded, one severely injured and the third escaped.
The incident was swiftly reported to Kinim police who responded and arrested four suspects and locked them up at Kinim police station. Two suspects were from Dimer village while the other two from nearby Gial village.
In retaliation, a pressure group from Urugen raided Kinim police station at about 4 this morning and beheaded two of the four suspects while the other two escaped.
The bodies of the beheaded suspects at Kinim police station remain unclaimed while their heads were taken to Gial village.
The same group from Urugen also allegedly burnt down sections of Gial village. It’s been reported that Dimer villagers have fled their homes in fear of the pressure groups from Urugen.
With Kinim police personnel outnumbered at this stage, Madang Provincial Police Commander (PPC) Superintendent Robert Baim has deployed police troops to Karkar Island with the support of the Sumkar District Development Authority, to contain the situation and restore law and order.
""We are calling on all Karkar people, community leaders, and youth groups to cooperate fully with police in maintaining peace and protecting lives and property,” PPC Baim said. “Let us work together to bring calm, unity, and safety back to our island.”
“Violence and destruction will only harm our families and future,"" he stressed.

PM Marape welcomes UN Secretary-General’s COP30 message,7/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6760,TVWAN,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has commended the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres for his powerful and uncompromising address at the opening of the World Leaders Climate Action Summit during COP30 in Belém, describing it as “a moral compass for world leaders to act decisively in this decade of truth.”
Prime Minister Marape said the Secretary-General’s remarks resonated deeply with the Pacific and forest nations, especially those like Papua New Guinea that are on the frontline of the climate crisis but least responsible for it.
“Secretary-General Guterres spoke the truth that the world must hear,” Prime Minister Marape said. “When he declared that ‘the 1.5°C limit is a red line for humanity’, he spoke for every vulnerable island and forest nation fighting for survival. Papua New Guinea fully aligns with his call for courageous, collective, and urgent action.”
He welcomed the Secretary-General’s call for a “paradigm shift” to limit the magnitude and duration of global temperature overshoot, accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuels, and protect critical ecosystems such as tropical forests and oceans — the planet’s natural carbon sinks.
“Papua New Guinea stands shoulder to shoulder with the United Nations and forest nations like Brazil in protecting the lungs of the Earth,” he said. “We are committed to conserving our 13 per cent share of the world’s tropical rainforest, sustaining 97 per cent of land under customary ownership, and ensuring our people benefit equitably from global carbon markets.”
He further applauded the Secretary-General’s strong emphasis on climate justice and equitable financing, which remains a central challenge for developing nations.
“Mr Guterres was right to call out the injustice of the current system — where developing nations continue to suffer the worst effects of a crisis they did not cause,” the Prime Minister said. “We join his call for developed nations to mobilise the agreed US$1.3 trillion annually by 2035 and ensure that funds for adaptation and resilience reach those most affected.”
He said Papua New Guinea was already advancing clean energy, forest conservation, and sustainable agriculture initiatives — but that such efforts needed genuine international partnership and investment.
Prime Minister Marape echoed the Secretary-General’s plea to make COP30 in Belém “the turning point” for global climate action and justice.
“As the Secretary-General said, ‘no one can bargain with physics, but we can choose to lead – or be led to ruin.’ This is the decisive decade for humanity,” Prime Minister Marape said. “Papua New Guinea stands with the United Nations and Brazil in turning pledges into real action — through courage, solidarity, and science-based leadership.”
He added that Papua New Guinea, as a leading Pacific democracy and a custodian of rich forests and oceans, would continue to advance South–South cooperation, build partnerships with fellow forest nations, and champion the Pacific voice for climate justice.
“Belém is not only the host city of COP30 — it is a symbol of the world’s conscience,” he said. “Papua New Guinea is honoured to stand here in solidarity with global leaders who are ready to act for our planet and future generations.”"
UN chief urges world leaders to drive down global warming,7/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6759,TVWAN,Environment,Fear,Nill,"As world leaders gather in Brazil for the COP30 climate summit, UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Thursday called for urgent action to drive down global temperatures and keep the 1.5°C goal within reach.
“Every fraction of a degree means more hunger, displacement, and loss – especially for those least responsible. It could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unlivable conditions, and amplify threats to peace and security,” Guterres told leaders in Belém.
Failure to contain global heating amounts to “moral failure and deadly negligence,” he added.
Each year that is warmer, he said, “will hammer economies, deepen inequalities and impact developing countries hardest — even though they did least to cause it.”
“After decades of denial and delay, science now tells us that a temporary overshoot beyond the 1.5°C limit – starting at the latest in the early 2030s – is inevitable,” Guterres continued.
“We need a fundamental paradigm shift to limit this overshoot’s magnitude and duration and quickly drive it down. Even a temporary overshoot will unleash far greater destruction and costs for every nation.”
Echoing his remarks, World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) chief Celeste Saulo said that greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest level in 800,000 years.
“From January to August this year, the Earth’s average temperature was about 1.42°C above pre-industrial levels, with oceans also reaching record highs, which is inflicting lasting damage on marine ecosystems and economies,” she said.
The planet’s relentless warming trend has shown no sign of slowing, with 2025 projected to be either the second or third warmest year on record, according to the State of the Global Climate Update 2025 issued by the WMO on Thursday.
It warns that the 11-year stretch from 2015 to 2025 will be the hottest period since records began 176 years ago.
“This unprecedented streak of high temperatures, combined with last year’s record increase in greenhouse gas levels, makes it clear that it will be virtually impossible to limit global warming to 1.5°C in the next few years without temporarily overshooting this target,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.
She stressed that science still shows it is possible to bring temperatures back below that threshold by the end of the century.
The report paints a stark picture of compounding climate impacts.
Arctic sea ice reached its lowest winter maximum on record, while Antarctic Sea ice remained well below average.
Global sea level rise, nearly twice as fast as in the 1990s, continued to accelerate due to ocean warming and ice melt.
Extreme weather events – from devastating floods and storms to prolonged heatwaves and wildfires – have disrupted food systems, displaced communities and hindered economic development across multiple regions.
The Secretary-General told COP30 that the 1.5°C limit remains “a red line for humanity”, calling for rapid emissions cuts, an accelerated phase-out of fossil fuels, and stronger protection of forests and oceans.
Guterres highlighted the growing momentum of the clean energy revolution, noting that investments in renewables now exceed those in fossil fuels by $800 billion. “Clean energy is winning in price, performance, and potential,” he said, “but what is still missing is political courage.”
Also addressing delegates, Marinez Scherer, COP30’s Special Envoy for the Ocean, urged nations to unite efforts for both forests and oceans, calling them “one living system” that shapes the planet’s climate.
“Science is clear – we cannot solve the climate crisis unless we act together for the ocean,” she said, pointing to the Amazon and the Atlantic as symbols of this connection.
Dr Scherer, a marine biologist and coastal management expert at Brazil’s Federal University of Santa Catarina, noted that the ocean produces over half of the world’s oxygen, absorbs 90 per cent of excess heat, and sustains billions of livelihoods — yet receives less than one per cent of global climate finance.
“Protecting the ocean and the Amazon is not just an environmental imperative, but a collective act of survival,” she said. “The ocean cannot wait, and neither can we,” said Dr Scherer."
Why PNG’s Highest Leaders Must Lead the Charge Against the National HIV Crisis,7/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6758,TVWAN,Health,Anticipation,James Marape,"With the recent declaration of a national HIV crisis, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Papua New Guinea, Richard Stephen Howard, Jr., and Manoela Manova,UNAIDS Country Director for Papua New Guinea provide their opinion through this Editorial on the subject, highlighting the importance of leadership in addressing the epidermic.
Papua New Guinea stands at a perilous crossroads in its efforts against HIV. With the recent declaration of a National HIV Crisis, the time for fragmented efforts is over. The magnitude of this emergency demands absolute unity, decisive action, and sustained investment from every sector of society.
This is why the PNG Christian Leaders HIV Media Conference, held on 29 October 2025 was a critical turning point and a beacon of hope. This event witnessed the powerful public unity of His Eminence John Cardinal Ribat, Chair of the PNG Christian Leaders Alliance on HIV and AIDS (PNGCLA), and Prime Minister Hon. James Marape, who jointly addressed the nation’s growing epidemic.
The Media Conference brought together key partners including the United Nations in Papua New Guinea through UNAIDS, the Australian Government, the National Department of Health, the National AIDS Council Secretariat, and Church and Community Leaders, including representatives of People Living with HIV in PNG.
The Urgent State of the Epidemic
The urgency cannot be overstated. While the world has reduced new HIV infections by 39% since 2010, new infections in PNG have significantly increased by 84% in the same period. Currently, it is estimated that 30 people are newly acquiring HIV in PNG every single day. This resulted in an estimated 11,000 new infections in 2024, bringing the total estimated number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) to 120,000, representing a national HIV prevalence of 1.5%.
This crisis devastates lives, impacting vulnerable individuals, primarily women and children. The majority of infections are sexually transmitted, and critically, 60% of people living with HIV in PNG are women. This includes the wives and female partners of male clients of Female Sex Workers (FSW) or Men who have Sex with Men (MSM).
Despite investments in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) that have averted a significant number of AIDS-related deaths, major gaps remain in reaching national targets:
•	Only 59% of PLHIV are estimated to know their status.
•	Only 46% of all PLHIV have achieved viral suppression.
•	The rate of HIV testing during antenatal care visits dropped drastically from above 80% prior to 2020 to just 47% in 2024. Only three out of ten pregnant women (30%) know their HIV status, resulting in only 36% of an estimated 2,039 pregnant women living with HIV receiving necessary treatment.
The Indispensable Role of Faith and Community
Addressing this crisis requires not just medical facilities, but spiritual and community mobilization. Church leaders and faith-based organizations (FBOs) are critical partners in this response.
The sources confirm that of the nation’s 834 health facilities, 368 (45%) are faith-based health clinics, providing an essential and central partner network.
As Prime Minister Marape noted, the churches are ""ever present, serving humanity through healing, education, and care"" in every village. They reach people in ways no government agency can easily achieve.
The PNGCLA, under Cardinal Ribat's leadership, has rightly recognized that awareness and testing alone are insufficient. We must heed their call to invest time and resources in addressing the root causes and underlying contributing factors fueling HIV transmission, including poverty, unemployment, gender-based violence, stigma, and discrimination. The PNGCLA’s strategy includes establishing Integrated SME Trainings to alleviate poverty and unemployment for vulnerable populations.
A Whole-of-Society Partnership
The joint presence of the Prime Minister and the Cardinal at the Media Conference highlights the unwavering commitment to a full partnership. The government’s provision of budget allocation for the purchase of antiretroviral drugs is vital for sustaining the health of People living with HIV and prolonging life expectancy. The Government will continue to support the churches’ work on HIV and work closely with the United Nations, and other development partners - while actively engaging community groups and populations most affected by HIV, including people living with HIV - to leverage collective expertise, technical advice, and on-the-ground experience.
This whole-of-society response must involve strong coordination across all sectors. We acknowledge the national commitment to making free HIV testing and treatment available. Services are delivered through a network including more than 400 HIV Testing Sites and 165 HIV Treatment Sites.
Aggressive Prevention and Scale-Up
To halt the crisis, PNG needs to transition to aggressive, proactive prevention actions. The National STI and HIV Strategy 2024-2028 requires an investment of PGK 218 million annually to see PNG back on track to ending the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat.
This investment needs to prioritize comprehensive prevention, focusing on:
1.	Widespread Condom Distribution.
2.	Community-Led HIV Screening (essential to reach the 41% of PLHIV who do not know their status).
3.	Scale-up of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) (part of the Comprehensive STI & HIV Prevention strategy).
By focusing on early diagnosis, effective treatment, tailored care, and, crucially, tackling the social and economic drivers of vulnerability, we can protect the more than five million young people in PNG who are especially vulnerable.
The unity shown by Prime Minister Marape and Cardinal Ribat is the galvanizing force needed to mobilize the necessary resources and compassion to confront the stigma that isolates and marginalizes people living with HIV.
Together, we can safeguard the future of Papua New Guinea."
Sepik Cocoa Wins Hearts,7/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6757,,Business,Trust,Nill,"Papua New Guinea’s cocoa from the Sepik region has captured the attention of British chocolatiers and specialty buyers, following a two-day cocoa tasting event held in Baimuru Village, Yangoru-Saussia District.
The mini-Cocoa Cupping competition brought together nine UK chocolatiers and importers who sampled chocolates made from 39 cocoa producer submissions from the Greater Sepik region. The visitors praised the beans’ consistent processing and high export-grade quality, signalling a promising future for PNG cocoa in European markets.
Judges from the Cocoa Board of PNG, Rubio Cocoa Plantation and Queen Emma Chocolate Company led the evaluation. Chairperson Kenny Francis said the samples were of impressive quality. “There were no major defects in all the samples,” Francis said. “You should be proud because nearly all cocoa beans are of A-grade export quality.”
British chocolatiers shared similar sentiments. Sophie Jewett from York Cocoa House said she was “very grateful to the people of Sepik” and would gladly use PNG cocoa in her UK factory. Alex O’Connor from Nutricraft House noted that the beans were “smokeless and clean,” reflecting improved post-harvest practices.
The event, hosted by Yekere Cooperative Society with support from the Cocoa Board, FAO’s EU-STREIT PNG Programme, and the International Trade Centre’s UK Trade Partnership (UKTP) Programme, aimed to link local producers directly with international buyers.
UKTP Project Manager for the Pacific, Candice Webb Ungerer, said the goal was to build sustainable partnerships. “The welcome we received was incredible, and this event gave buyers a rare chance to experience so many quality cocoa products in one place,” she said.
The success follows last month’s market-readiness training for 68 Sepik cocoa producers, preparing them for European export standards. The event also sets the stage for the National Cocoa of Excellence and Agri Trade Show planned for 2026 in the Sepik region."

NFA Defends Active Role in Surveillance,7/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6753,,Fisheries,Trust,Nill,"The National Fisheries Authority (NFA), under the Ministry of Fisheries & Marine Resources, has reaffirmed its firm commitment to safeguarding Papua New Guinea’s vast maritime fisheries resources — especially amid recent public commentary about surveillance operations in Manus Province.
In a media statement released today, the NFA clarified that it has not been absent from surveillance operations, contrary to suggestions linked to activities at the Lombrum Naval Base.
The Authority underscored that it has actively taken part in multiple joint surveillance exercises under regional frameworks such as the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and the Pacific Maritime Security Program (PMSP).
Facing one of the Pacific’s largest Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), Papua New Guinea’s marine domain spans millions of square kilometres, making the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing both urgent and complex. The NFA says IUU fishing threatens the country’s food security, economic sovereignty and fisheries sustainability.
The Authority detailed a multi-pronged strategy to strengthen surveillance and enforcement:
- Improved inter-agency coordination and intelligence-sharing via regional partners.
- Investment in advanced monitoring tools, including satellite tracking and real-time catch verification systems.
- Establishment of two forward command bases: one in Daru (Western Province) by Nov 2025 and another in Vanimo   (West Sepik) by the third quarter of 2026.
- Deployment of four new dedicated fisheries patrol vessels, arriving this month, under the command of NFA’s Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) Unit — a first for PNG’s own national fisheries fleet.
Chartering of offshore patrol vessels for long-range patrols and introduction of new ICT systems for real-time data transmission and vessel reporting.
Community-based fisheries management, public awareness campaigns, and ongoing training for provincial fisheries officers to ensure coastal communities become active stewards of their marine resources.
The NFA emphasised records of inspections, patrols and prosecutions—not just regionally, but nationally—refuting any suggestion of inactivity. The statement urged all agencies and leaders to move forward guided by facts, in genuine collaboration.
The protection of Papua New Guinea’s fisheries, it noted, is a shared responsibility."

Commissioner Manning said the police cadets made the arrest and detained the accused at the Badili police cells on the 3rd of November.
""The accused member, who was off-duty at the time, was observed demanding money from the family of a man who had been detained.
""When the money was handed to and accepted by the member, two cadet officers acted quickly to arrest and lock the officer in cell.
""That was a job well done by these young policemen, and it bodes well for a bright future in the RPNGC for them both.""
The Internal Affairs Division responded and obtained evidence and witness statements.
The accused member has been suspended from the RPNGC, will be charged and taken through both disciplinary and criminal channels, pending the outcome of the Internal Affairs report."

Minister directs for digital registration of health workers,7/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6752,,Health,Trust,Elias Kapavore,"Minister for Health Elias Kapavore, has directed the National Department of Health (NDoH) to move to digital registration of health workers in the country, by June 2026.
Speaking at a recent workshop on Digital Health Workers’ Registration, this week, Minister Kapavore said that digital registration of all cadres of health workers is a matter of critical concern which is long overdue.
“We can't continue the manual registration of health workers,” the minister said.
The minister said he wants the manual registration of health workers to cease immediately and the department to establish efficient human resource (HR) data to reflect the changing digital age.
“The country celebrated 50 years of independence this year. Hence, we must remain relevant with human resources information system to complement the National Health information data base”, he stated.
He related to the PNG University of Medicine and Health Sciences Bill recently passed in Parliament, to be aimed at increasing enrolment to meet the health workforce gap.
“This arrangement will complement the recently approved Health Services Commission arrangement,” he stated.
“These are key revolutionary and milestone strategies must now pave the way and set the scene for a modernised health sector workforce in Papua New Guinea for the next fifty years.
“Everyone coming out of the health training institutions must be posted to a position that is waiting for them. No more advertisement, no more going to DPM,” said Kapavore.
He acknowledged development partners including Australia government, World Health Organisation and others that continue to provide capacity building support for the country’s health work force.
“My aim now is to establish a Health Service Commission – just like the Teaching Service Commission, where all health workers, upon graduation, are directly deployed to all Provincial Health Authorities (PHAs} in the country, rather than having to wait for Department of Personnel Management to give approvals.
“The Marape-led government is committed to supporting health.
“It is now up to us to create the agenda and come up with the priorities with specifications and seek support."
RPNGC inks deal with New Ireland,6/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6744,,Politics,Trust,"Peter Tsiamalili Jr., Walter Schnaubelt","The New Ireland Provincial Government (NIPG) and the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) have entered into a partnership that will see the Police Reservist Training Program conducted New Ireland Province.
A Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) formalizing the partnership was signed on November 5, 2025 at the RPNGC Headquarters in Konedobu, Port Moresby, by Commissioner of Police David Manning, New Ireland Governor Walter Schnaubelt, Provincial Administrator Richard Andia, and the Deputy Commissioner of Administration.
The agreement marks a major milestone in strengthening collaboration between the RPNGC and NIPG to improve law and order, enhance community safety, and build local policing capacity in the province.
Under the MoA, the RPNGC will deliver a comprehensive reservist training program to equip selected participants with essential policing knowledge, skills, and ethical standards. Once trained, the reservists will operate as an extension of the RPNGC, particularly in rural and remote areas where regular police presence is limited.
Schnaubelt expressed his appreciation to Commissioner Manning and the Minister for Police, Peter Tsiamalili Jr. for their continued leadership in strengthening community policing initiatives nationwide.
“This is a timely and strategic move to empower our communities to take ownership of their safety and work hand in hand with law enforcement authorities,” Schnaubelt said.
“As provincial leaders, we are always seeking ways to engage our youth in positive and meaningful activities. Partnering with the RPNGC allows us to address manpower challenges in policing while creating opportunities for young people to contribute to their communities.”
Schnaubelt further noted that the program will serve as a potential pathway for capable reservists to transition into full-time police careers, further strengthening the province’s policing capacity.
Commissioner of Police David Manning commended the New Ireland Provincial Government for its leadership and proactive approach to supporting community policing.
“This program will not only expand our operational reach but also strengthen trust and cooperation between the police and the people,” Commissioner Manning said during the MoA signing.
“Our greatest challenge continues to be manpower shortages. Through this initiative, we aim to establish 200 reservists in each province to enhance our visibility and presence within communities. This MoA with New Ireland brings that vision closer to reality.”
Manning added that following the initial training phase, a tripartite MoA will be signed with the training service provider to ensure reservists are effectively trained, managed, and utilised.
Recruitment and selection of the first 200 reservists in New Ireland Province which will be sourced from the two districts of Kavieng and Namatanai will begin shortly, with training expected to commence next year. The program will be conducted annually to build and maintain a strong reserve force that supports the RPNGC’s community policing objectives.
This initiative forms part of a broader national and provincial government commitment to restore law and order, promote peace, and foster social and economic development across the country.
Meanwhile, a further recruitment and training of Community Auxiliary Police (CAP) has also been mooted recently by the Provincial Law and Order Committee chaired by Schnaubelt, for 142 council wards in the 10 LLGs of New Ireland, which the provincial government and the two district DDAs will consider appropriating funding for the CAP at the ward level."
Nomane raises concerns over delayed Wafi-Golpu mine,6/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6741,,Politics,Anger,"James Marape, James Nomane","Member for Chuave, James Nomane has voiced significant concerns about Prime Minister James Marape's handling of the Wafi-Golpu deal, suggesting that the delays highlight a lack of strategic leadership.
Nomane criticized the Marape government for being ""long on rhetoric but short on delivery,"" arguing that this approach is having detrimental effects on investor confidence and creating unrest among landowners.
He emphasized that these issues could lead Papua New Guinea (PNG) to miss out on billions in potential revenue.
“This protracted delay is a disgrace, and a betrayal of the people of Morobe, who were promised jobs, royalties, and infrastructure.
“The Wafi-Golpu project is projected to produce 266,000 ounces of gold and 161,000 tonnes of copper annually, with a 17 million tonne per annum processing capacity. Yet under Marape’s watch, this economic engine remains idle.
“The Prime Minister must own up and resign for being unable to deliver Wafi-Golpu.”
Nomane also pointed to the potential grey listing of PNG as a serious warning sign, suggesting that the country is facing increased scrutiny and risks to its economic stability.
He argued that under Marape's leadership, conditions are likely to deteriorate further, which could have serious implications for the nation's economic future."

MPs urged to make decisions that best serve the country,6/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6743,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Members of Parliament must make their decisions based on who they believe would best serve the country’s interests.
Prime Minister James Marape made these remarks in the wake of another unsuccessful attempt by the Opposition to file a motion of no confidence against his leadership during the last session of Parliament.
“You have seen me run government for six years. Mr O’Neill has run government for eight years. Our MPs are not naïve — they see the character, leadership style, and performance of both leaders up close. They will decide what is good for the country,” he said.
Marape emphasized that Members of Parliament should prioritize the country’s interests when making their decisions, especially in the context of ongoing political challenges.
“I told my Members of Parliament — you decide for yourself. If you believe Mr. O’Neill is the better leader, you can vote for him. If you believe I should continue, then stand with me. That is democracy.”
The Prime Minister’s statement reflects a call for unity and focus on governance despite political rivalries, urging MPs to consider the broader implications of their actions on the nation.
He said his commitment to navigating the political landscape while advocating for policies that serve the welfare of the people of Papua New Guinea remains paramount.
Marape also called on aspiring leaders to prepare for the 2027 National Elections, which are only 14 months away.
“Start building your parties, prepare your campaign, and earn the people’s trust,” he said.
“If you are trusted by the people, you will receive a Section 63 invitation to form government after the elections. That is the safest and most legitimate path to leadership — not through shortcuts, disruptions, or political hypnosis that disturbs the nation’s progress.”"

Head trainer Gibson Daniels, who leads the Highlands Zone team, said the visit to Tutu Beach Early Childhood Learning Centre aimed to observe how teachers applied what they learned in the classroom.

He said all evaluation results will be sent to their Australian coordinator, to help improve future programs.
“If we have better brains, we’ll have a better future,” Daniels said. “That starts with strong early childhood education.”"
Dr Billy blames SHPG for polling delay,6/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6730,,Politics,Anger,"Billy Joseph, William Powi","Member for Nipa Kutubu and Minister for Defence Dr. Billy Joseph has clarified that the delay in polling for the current LLG elections and related problems happening in Nipa is not a result of the alleged discrepancies in the common roll as claimed by the Governor of Southern Highlands Province (SHP), William Powi.
“It is a pity the constitutional rights of the people of the newly created Upper Nipa LLG and certain wards of the Nipa Basin LLG to vote and elect their ward councilors in the current LLG elections continue to be denied and held at hostage by certain individuals with vested political interests,” Dr. Billy said.
He said the breakdown of law and order in Nipa District is due to the lack of support by the provincial administration and police to the PNG Electoral Commission (PNGEC), accusing them of compromising on their constitutional responsibilities.
“It’s serious a constitutional process set into motion by law is allowed to be sabotaged by mobs and thugs under the watchful eyes of the agencies who should be protecting the process to complete,” Dr. Billy said.
The minister further claimed that provincial administration officials and police in Mendi were operating at the behest of someone and driving the political agendas of certain individuals.
Provincial Administrator David Kelma denied these claims, saying the SHP government and a few district development authorities supported the national government through the PNGEC by making funds available to conduct the LLG election in the province.
“My office in consultation with PNGEC has strongly recommended for LLG managers to assist the commission as ARO and they did a fantastic job and almost 85% of polling in the 5 districts were peacefully done followed by counting and declaration.
“We get such results when public servants are involved to take the lead as ROs and AROs.
“Thus, our politicians must have respect for public servants who are the core group of people who always stand ready to deliver government programs and policy,” the administrator said.
Kelma also defended the work of SHP police, commending them for ensuring elections ran smoothly.
“Mendi police personnel did exceptionally well in providing security for smooth polling in the province. Polling cannot be conducted in some places in my province without police. Their presence in a ward plays a significant role,” Kelma added.
Meantime, Dr Billy said he has reached out to the Commissioner of Police and other relevant authorities to ensure the conduct of individuals in this mayhem come under scrutiny.
“A formal police complaint has been laid with the Commissioner of Police at the police HQ in Konedobu and this requires police to call up the perpetrators and ring leaders to be arrested,” Minister Joseph said.
He said the problems in Nipa now are caused by ingenuine people who are hellbent on defying the lawful instruction of the PNG Electoral Commission to fail the LLG election.
He urged the PPC Southern Highlands to act on the reports submitted to his office and do his job by arresting the thugs and their ring leaders to ensure the 2025 LLG elections come to a successful conclusion.
He concluded that the 2025 rolls update was a constitutional process fulfilled by the PNGEC and any matters arising out of this process must be addressed and corrected through the same process or the courts."

Police after searching him, found in his possession ballot paper butts, ballot papers, and polling journals in his bag.
Provincial Police Commander Superintendent Robert Baim said scrutineers at the counting venue became suspicious about his behavior after monitoring him for the past four days at the counting venue.
He also had a heated argument with another polling official after the polling official accused him of being on the phone the whole day when he was not supposed to and also for continuously checking figures of counted mayor seat votes from the tally booth.

Superintendent Baim confirmed the arrest overnight stating that the officer is detained at Jomba Police station and will be charged under the Election-Related Offenses Act.
Baim added this case serves as a warning to polling officials to carry out their duties diligently and honestly.
“Every eye is on them and that police will not tolerate any attempt to cheat or interfere with the democratic process,” he warned.

Electoral Commissioner Simon Sinai said his office is committed to fulfilling its constitutional mandate by delivering free, fair and credible LLG elections for the country.
“I want to assure all citizens, and our key stakeholders which includes: Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs, Inter-Department Election Committee, and Provincial Administrations that the election is progressing smoothly despite challenges, with polling nearing completion in every district and province in the country,” he said.
Mr Sinai said those districts that have completed polling have gone into counting with declarations of winners made so far in some Wards and LLGs as counting progresses.
He said LLG elections have been always challenging because of the local settings as it involves family members and tribesmen, resulting in family conflicts and disagreements.
“This is where LLG elections are always challenging. Sometimes our polling teams will have to walk miles down the valleys, climb the mountains and cross the rivers to reach the most isolated villages and hamlets in the country with the ballot papers, to give our people the opportunity to vote. The story is the same for people living on the coast, where polling officials have to hop on canoes and dinghies to reach the remote islands villages to conduct polling,” said Mr Sinai.
For the Highlands Region and Morobe Province, Mr Sinai said the LLG president seat will be contested by Ward members in the council chamber through normal lobbying process and whoever has the majority support will get elected as the LLG president. For the coastal provinces, the ward councilors and LLG president will be elected directly by the people through the normal LPV counting process.
The Electoral Commissioner assured the people and especially the Minister for Provincial and Local Government Affairs and Minister responsible for the LLG Elections Soroi Eoe MP that the election remains on schedule and the writs would be returned on time.

Juha LOs oppose DPE gazettal notice,5/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6725,,Business,Anger,Nill,"Land owning groups in the Juha Petroleum Development License 09 in the Hela Province have a submitted a letter of objection to the Department of Petroleum and Energy over a published Gazette #1086.
The objection letter pointed out that the Ministerial Determination that allocates Juha PDL 9 benefits to Western Province is unlawful.
The Juha landowners highlighted three grounds in the objection letter.
First, the PDL 9 landowners claim they are the 100% legitimate resource owners of the project impact area in the PNG LNG Project under the Topi and Umimi Council Wards in the Koroba LLG, Koroba District of Hela Province.
They believe this area concerns them and there is no customary claim by landowners in Western Province over this area.
The PDL 9 landowners also highlighted that there are false beneficiary allocation in the gazette notice which 80% of benefits diverted to Western Province.
The Juha clans from Hela brushed aside claims by Chief John Wabi Sala which they describe as false, misleading and incorrect.
Furthermore, the PDL9 faction believe the project area is within their land boundary under the stewardship of the Sinali tribe of Hela.
The last point in the objection letter is compromised coordination.
The landowners claimed that the Juha PDL 09 Coordinator compromised the integrity of the Landowner Identification process.
They believe this has resulted in misrepresentation of landownership and unjust allocation of benefits.
The Juha PDL 09 faction say the Gazette was published without proper consultation between the concern stakeholders, verification of land titles and acknowledgment of legitimate landowners.
They are now calling on the Department of Petroleum and Energy to consider their submission and retract the Gazette Notice and work with them for the good of the impacted communities."

GBV continues to affect thousands of families across PNG, but Regina Sagu Foundation, a community-based, non-government organisation, is working to change that narrative. Through targeted workshops and legal support, the initiative reached more than 700 individuals in 2024, empowering communities to recognize abuse and seek justice.

In Enga Province, 384 participants attended GBV awareness sessions, while 75 people joined similar programs in Port Moresby. Partnerships with businesses such as Trans Wonderland and plans to involve Digicel Cup sports teams aim to extend advocacy into workplaces and sporting communities—spaces where exposure to violence is often high.
“We believe sports teams are key influencers,” said Legal Program Officer Tommy Aiyok. “Many players and fans have either experienced or witnessed violence. Bringing GBV education into these circles can create ripple effects.”
Beyond education, the initiative offers free legal assistance to GBV survivors—a critical service in a country where access to justice can be slow and costly. Supported by three full-time lawyers, the program helps victims obtain interim and permanent protection orders, ensuring immediate safety and long-term security.
“Violence can only be stopped when an order is in place,” said Mr. Aiyok. “Our goal is to make justice swift and accessible.”
Currently, the team is developing a case management system to streamline support for walk-in clients and referrals, aiming to reduce turnaround time for court orders to five days, a significant improvement compared to typical delays.
The program works closely with the Enga Provincial Administration and civil society organizations, responding to invitations for community workshops and school talks.
Plans for 2025 include expanding outreach to sports communities and strengthening collaboration with NGOs to scale legal services nationwide.
Mr. Aiyok stressed that their mission goes beyond advocacy.
“We’re not just raising awareness; we’re providing solutions. Safety and justice must go hand in hand.”
The initiative was showcased under the theme “Safe Spaces, Strong Voices” during the Australian Broadcasting Corporation International Development Papua New Guinea Media Development Initiative (ABCID PNG-MDI) event on 24 October at Lamana Hotel, Port Moresby.
The event brought together media professionals and civil society organizations working to address violence, reintegration, and community healing—underscoring the Foundation’s commitment to Justice Sagu’s legacy of empowering communities through literacy, safety, and legal support."
Indigenous Values Vital to Guide PNG’s Fight Against Corruption,5/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6722,,Politics,Disgust,James Marape,"Papua New Guinea’s anti-corruption drive has faced a major setback after its flagship agency, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), faced challenges amid internal scandals — a crisis that governance expert Yuambari Haihuie says highlights the need for culturally grounded solutions, not just technology.
The ICAC, launched in 2023 under Prime Minister James Marape’s reform agenda, was intended to restore public trust. But less than two years later, its three inaugural commissioners — all expatriates — were suspended following allegations of misconduct, including unilateral decision-making and unauthorized expenses.
Haihuie, a former deputy director at Transparency International PNG and now a public policy scholar at ANU, argues that PNG’s fight against corruption cannot succeed by isolating cultural norms such as the wantok system and “big man” leadership. Instead, he says, these traditions should be harnessed to build alliances and strengthen accountability.
He is concerned that the lack of performance by this newly established constitutional office has frustrated taxpayers, with 51.4 million kina (US$12.2 million) allocated to ICAC in the 2025 budget. It also threatens PNG’s IMF-backed economic reforms and anti-money-laundering commitments, raising fears of grey-listing by the Financial Action Task Force — a move that could cripple foreign investment and increase borrowing costs.
Marape has announced plans to use artificial intelligence in governance, including public appointments and procurement. But Haihuie warns that technology alone cannot resolve issues rooted in PNG’s political and cultural fabric. “AI can support transparency, but real reform must draw on cultural values of reciprocity and obligation,” he says.
As investigations continue, Papua New Guineans are demanding results. With the nation marking 50 years of independence, the ICAC saga has become a defining test of whether PNG can overcome entrenched corruption and deliver on its promise of good governance."
PNG Forest Governance Questioned ahead of COP30 Summit,5/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6720,,Environment,Anger,Nill,"Act Now campaign manager, Eddie Tanago Paine is appalled at how the Prime Minister will go advocate at COP30 in Brazil to protect forests when it’s a different story back in the country.
Eddie has been vocal about the abuse of Forest Clearing Authorities (FCAs) by logging companies in PNG where 1.68 million hectares of forests are currently under threat from FCAs.
He says despite a moratorium on new FCA licenses, the National Forest Board has not publicly made available the promised audit reports on existing FCA projects and logs are still being exported.
He is accusing the National Forest Board and the PNG Forest Authority’s lack of effectiveness back home, contradicting the Prime Minister’s commitments to protect forests at the COP 30 meeting in Brazil.
In stating facts, he said in 2024, there were 18 operational FCA logging projects that produced over 500,000 cubic metres of timber for export to China. The logs were valued at over K200 million (US$50 million). Five of the FCA projects operating in 2024 only started operations after the NFB imposed its moratorium.
He is concerned that there is a breakdown in governance in the forest sector because of a failure in leadership.
Further compounding evidences underlines the lack of governance in the sector. The Bank of PNG’s national risk assessment places the logging sector as ‘high risk’ for money laundering yet the lack of enforcement action by the authorities will largely contribute to PNGs’ grey listing come 2026."
New Honey Processing Plant for EHP Farmers,4/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6716,,Business,Joy,Nill,"Honey production in Papua New Guinea has received a major boost following the launch of a new state-of-the-art honey processing plant in the Eastern Highlands Province — the country’s leading honey-producing region.
Founder and owner of Helping Hand Honey Producers (HHHP) Kelly Inaie, expressed deep appreciation for the K181,504 funding assistance his company received from the World Bank through the National Government, under the PNG Agriculture Commercialization and Diversification (PACD) Program managed by the Coffee Industry Corporation (CIC).
The total funding package worth K1.7 million was distributed among 10 selected honey bee farmers across the Highlands region — including four from Eastern Highlands, three from Simbu, two from Jiwaka, and one from Western Highlands.
Mr. Inaie said the new processing facility will not only improve honey quality and production but will also include storage space, a training venue, and conference facilities to train and empower local beekeepers.
“This is a milestone achievement for my company and for all local honey farmers. With this funding, we can produce quality honey and also train others to do the same,” Inaie said.
The Department of Agriculture and Livestock recognized HHHP’s contribution to PNG’s honey industry and commended Inaie’s ongoing commitment to empowering smallholder farmers.
Mr. Inaie has also represented Papua New Guinea at international honey conferences in Fiji and the Philippines, and his contributions to agriculture and entrepreneurship have earned him several awards — including the 2019 Digicel Man of Honor Award, 2020 PNG SME Award (Runner-up), and the 2021 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Award for the East Asia Pacific Young Entrepreneur.
He successfully met 10 of the 17 UN SDGs, making him one of the few Papua New Guineans recognized internationally for sustainable business practices.
Mr. Inaie thanked the CIC PACD, World Bank, and the PNG Government for their continued support in strengthening honey production and improving livelihoods for rural farmers."
Sungi outlines positive impact from COP29 boycott,4/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6712,,Environment,Trust,James Marape,"Acting Managing Director for Climate Change Development Adaptation (CCDA), Debra Sungi says the action of Prime Minister James Marape in not attending COP meetings in the past in protest over the lack of action by the big players in the Climate Change space has indeed made positive difference in getting the attention of developed countries.
Sungi said when PNG did not participate at the COP29 last year, it sent a very strong message to the global community that PNG is tired of just going there and sitting in negotiations yet not seeing any benefit for the country.
She said this action has resulted in a positive outcome with the Green Climate Fund board meeting hosted Port Moresby this year and fundings endorsed for the REDD+ program.
“Green Climate fund is the biggest financial mechanism established under the UN Convention on Climate Change and that’s where the COP process is. And they have, for the first time, endorsed and given to Papua New Guinea USD63.4million for REDD+ after so many years of discussions and that political message is strong, as we’ve seen,” she said.
Sungi explained that the significance of hosting this year’s COP meeting in Belem, Brazil is because that is where the Amazon Forest is, and given that PNG is also the third largest tropical rain forest country in the world, Prime Minister will be taking the delegation to the COP30 to make a very strong statement in terms of ensuring that PNG must be paid for preserving forests.
She added that with this COP, all forest nations have rallied together, led by the Brazilian government to with the aim to good outcomes from the leaders’ summit that would be hosted on the 6th and 7th November, 12025.
She said given that Papua New Guinea has almost 35 million hectares of forest cover intact, this is a good opportunity for PNG with the Prime Minister taking the lead to give a very clear message to the leaders of the developed countries to really see the importance of forest and make very strong commitments.
Apart from the forest, PNG also has the NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) commitment and the global stock take that will be be done.
To contribute to these discussions, PNG will talk about is blue carbon solutions. The PM had already announced at the margins of the UN General Assembly, where there was a climate summit for the leaders and PNG’s commitment in terms of blue carbon solutions.
“So with that commitment there’s a strong message we will deliver as well in terms of scaling up finance for implementation of NDCs,” said Sungi.
Sungi re-iterated that the key message which the Prime Minister and his team together with the leaders from the smaller Pacific Island nations will be emphasizing at the COP, is the climate funding commitment set at the Paris agreement which has not been achieved.
“The call to have the USD1.3 trillion as of last year is a commitment and we need action.” She said."

PMGH CEO explains why the twins remain in PMGH,4/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6707,,Health,Sadness,Nill,"The conjoined twins who were received by Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH) last month as a referral case from ANGAU Memorial Hospital, have been diagnosed to have complex conginetal anomalies.
A statement released by the Chief Executive Office (CEO) of Port Moresby General Hospital stated that after extensive consultations, medical examinations and assessments by multi-disciplinary clinical team, both infants were found to have complex conginetal anomalies.
Taking the factors surrounding these anomalies into consideration, PMGH CEO, Dr Paki Molumi said they had agreed to continue to care for the twins at PMGH.
Dr. Paki Molumi stated that according to clinical findings, one of the twins has a single kidney, hypo plastic lungs, a severe conginetal heart defect; both share a liver, urinary bladder and proportions of gastrointestinal tract and spinal dysraphism noted on the CT scans of the twins.
“These anomalies are significant and even within a highly specialised surgical and intensive care setting, the outcome remains extemeley guarded, with a high likelihood of fatality for one or both of the infants,” Dr. Molumi stated.
He further expressed that even if the twin were to undergo surgery for separation it is likely that only one of the twin would survive. He added that the longterm care, interventions and rehabilitation required would be extensive for the family to sustain.
The parents who have two other children, 8 and 12 have been fully informed of these factors.
“Taking all these factors into account, our team collectively agreed that it is in the best interest of the twins and their family to continue  care here at the Port Moresby Geneal Hospital,” said Dr. Molumi.
Dr. Molumi assurred that the PMGH team remains committed to providing the specialised clinical and supportive care to both infants as well as psychological and social support to the parents and family during this difficult time."

When Bonny Simon contested in 2002, Ward Four area, comprising Redscar, Admin compound down to Kusbau and Madang Technical School, was a notorious zone known for petty crimes and theft. Fast forward to today, it is a place where mothers feel safe to do daily markets of fresh produce and cooked food.
C4, an alias for Council ward four, as he is commonly known in the area, made a mission to restore law and order and bring peace within the community.

Marape to advocate for forest protection at COP30,4/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6709,,Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape will for the first time participate in the Conference of Parties (COP30) meeting in Brazil since becoming the Prime Minister in 2019.
Prime Minister Marape has never taken part in COP meetings since becoming the Prime Minister of PNG because of what he views as a lack of climate action from industrialised nations on the matter.
“I must admit I have not attended any COP meetings in the past because many industrialised nations talk but do not take real action to reduce emissions.
“That has been my strongest view with countries of the world, especially those with huge carbon blueprints. As a climate victim in our small island states and coastal communities, PNG must strongly advocate, especially as the biggest country in the Pacific Islands Forum family,” he said.
Before his departure early this morning, Marape highlighted the importance of Papua New Guinea having its presence at COP30 saying this particular summit, (COP30) is particularly significant as it provides a platform for forest nations – like PNG and Brazil – to advocate for stronger climate action, forest conservation, and ocean protection.
“This is an extraordinary COP for Papua New Guinea and Brazil. Brazil, the biggest forest nation, is hosting it. So, a large forest nation is hosting the conference for the first time. This aligns with Article 5 and Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which focuses on forests and forest resource management,” said PM Marape.
PNG joins Brazil, Indonesia, and Malaysia as the world’s major tropical rainforest nations where PNG will advocate strongly with Brazil for global forest protection.
“PNG has high-integrity forests where around 70% of our landmass remains in its premium primary state, with minimal logging footprints. This means high car-bon sink capacity and extremely rich biodiversity,” he said.
“If the world wants us to save our forests for the benefit of humanity, then those with large carbon footprints must pay conservation dollars. These funds must go to our landowners, who have customary rights over the forests.”
The Conference of the Parties (COP) will take place from 10 to 21 November 2025 in Belém, northern Brazil, where the city will host tens of thousands of delegates, scientists, government representatives, journalists, and environmental activists from around the world.
The meeting is the main global forum under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), where world leaders negotiate and implement international climate agreements."
RPNGC & AFP to share resources to fight international crime,4/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6713,,Security,Trust,Nill,"The Royal PNG Constabulary (RPNGC) and the Australian Federal Police  (AFP) will work together to disrupt international criminal activities before they infiltrate the two countries.
This has been possible through the signing of a Joint Agency Agreement (JAA) between RPNGC and AFP recently.
Police Commissioner David Manning confirmed that the JAA, signed on November 2nd, is focused entirely on the sharp end of policing, deploying critical resources to identify and break apart criminal gangs before they can set up in PNG.
""International criminal networks are attempting to use PNG as a stepping stone for extending their illicit activities into Australia, but our police forces are working together to shut them down before they become active,"" the Commissioner said.
""This involves the mutual sharing of intelligence between our police forces. The sharing of AFP intelligence to support RPNGC operations in PNG, and the sharing of RPNGC intelligence with Australia on criminal activities developing in their country.
""International criminal networks are looking for ways into Australia through PNG, and together with the AFP, we are blocking them from getting a foothold in our country.
""We are stopping these gangs before they can try to transport drugs, money, and precious metals such as gold, as well as stopping the human trafficking of vulnerable people.
""The JAA is not about training, it is about aligning our policing operations to ensure we break apart these transnational criminal organisations, and arrest criminals and local facilitators who support them in both countries.
""This agreement gives us better access to intelligence products from our regional partners because these criminal groups do not respect borders,"" he said.
Commissioner Manning said the JAA is overseen by a steering committee made up of specialised police leadership from Papua New Guinea and Australia.
""The Joint Steering Committee facilitates the sharing of intelligence leading to the active detection of illegal movements and the interception and apprehension of criminals.
""The message is simple, for anyone in PNG, particularly foreign businesspeople seeking to make quick money by enabling illegal international activities, PNG and Australian police are coming for you,” Manning added."
PNG Through the Lens,4/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6708,,Culture,Joy,"James Marape, Justin Tkatchenko, Michael Somare","Papua New Guinea’s remarkable journey of growth, culture, and resilience was celebrated through a photography exhibition titled FOCUS: 50 Years of PNG Through the Lens.
The exhibition brought together the extraordinary work of two of the nation’s most respected photographers, Rocky Roe and Dinah Halstead, whose images told the story of PNG’s transformation over the past five decades.
Through more than 200 striking photographs, the exhibition showcased the nation’s beauty, diversity, and endurance - from historic moments like the twin volcanic eruptions in Rabaul to everyday life in remote villages and the vibrant cultural expressions seen in traditional dress and festivals.
Presented across nine thematic collections, FOCUS highlighted PNG’s evolving identity - capturing everything from life beneath the sea to national milestones and the industries that have shaped its economy. Each image served as a reminder of the importance of preserving the country’s natural and cultural heritage for future generations.
Renowned photographer Roe took viewers on a journey through PNG’s rugged landscapes, including the peaks of Mt Wilhelm in Chimbu Province and the hidden fjords of Tufi in Northern Province, offering rare glimpses into rural life and untouched beauty.
Meanwhile, Dinah Halstead, a pioneering diver and conservationist, turned her lens beneath the surface to reveal PNG’s underwater wonders. Her internationally acclaimed marine photography captured the vibrant biodiversity of the Coral Triangle, inspiring awareness and action for marine conservation.
The FOCUS: 50 Years of PNG Through the Lens exhibition officially opened on Monday, November 3, 2025, at APEC Haus in Port Moresby, with public viewing held from Tuesday, November 4 to 6.
Following its debut, the exhibition will tour towns and centres across Papua New Guinea, bringing this visual celebration to communities nationwide.
Prime Minister James Marape, Member for Moresby South and Minister for Foreign Affairs Justin Tkatchenko, and Bertha Somare, daughter of the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, were among the distinguished speakers at the launch.
Each reflected on the significance of photography in preserving national history and identity, praising Roe and Halstead for their lifelong dedication to capturing PNG’s story through powerful imagery.

Member for Moresby North East, John Kaupa, launched the association on Sunday, November 2.
The heavy downpour in the nation's capital did not stop the Bushwara community, who came in numbers to witness the launch of the Bushwara United Community Voice Inc.
MP Kaupa officiated at the event, marking the start of a strategic approach towards working together under the umbrella of resettlement.
“This association’s function is created through the interest of like-minded people, aimed at achieving goals and interests for the community. It is a not-for-profit organisation, but it has legal standing to work with developing partners to achieve the goals and aspirations of the community,” he said.
Kaupa said that since the eviction of those who settled in portions 2156, 2157, and 2159, about 937 houses were removed from this area, leaving almost 5,000 people displaced. The government has allocated K25 million for the resettlement exercise.
He said the government has allocated 62 hectares of land at Pari for the displaced settlers. They are currently working with relevant authorities to secure land titles.

Fathers must lead the fight against DV,3/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6689,,Society,Trust,Nill,"“Violence begins at home—and so does healing.” That was the message from Pastor Simon Kuman, who challenged fathers across Papua New Guinea to take the lead in ending domestic violence and restoring peace in their families.
Speaking under the theme Safe Spaces, Strong Voices, Ps Kuman urged men to stop the cycle of blame and begin the work of healing within their families. “Violence begins at home,” he said. “The family is the first institution God created—and it’s where restoration must begin.”
He highlighted the work of the Hope Behind Bars (HBB) Program, where young men use radio and school visits to raise awareness about murder, domestic violence, and the mistreatment of women. “We go to Gerehu Secondary School, Waigani Christian College, and many others,” he said. “We teach young boys how to treat their future wives and sisters with respect.”
Ps Kuman traced the roots of violence back to the Garden of Eden, arguing that anger and blame are embedded in human nature. “Nobody teaches you how to get angry—it’s already in us,” he said. “But fathers must lead with love, not blame.”
The event closed with a powerful testimony from Ellyn, a mother who served five years in prison for domestic violence. After finding faith behind bars, she graduated from Bible College and returned to prison—not as an inmate, but as a pastor. She now works to transform the lives of imprisoned mothers.
“Jesus is the solution,” Ps Kuman declared. “His blood cleanses the heart.”
“With peace, love, and mercy, we can rebuild our families and restore our country.”"

National Capital District Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab confirmed that police units are collecting evidence from possible eyewitnesses to establish the cause of his death.
I am urging city residents to be cautious when moving around. With the rising death toll, some people show a lack of respect for others.

Present at the gala were representatives of corporate houses, state agencies, cancer survivors, and friends of PNGCF, almost all in pink attire signifying the importance of pink October.
The PNG Cancer Foundation’s executive manager, Kimberley Kapigeno, while appreciating all who attended, especially sponsors and supporters, said it has been more than a decade since many have joined the foundation in pink ribbon luncheons and gatherings, which have become synonymous with breast cancer awareness advocacy and a cornerstone of the annual Think Pink campaign.
“This campaign has transitioned into another level,” she said.
“These luncheons have been instrumental in bringing together leaders, partners, and supporters to champion the cause of breast cancer awareness. There have been platforms for dialogue, education, and mobilization spaces where we shared stories, statistics, and solutions. Tonight (Friday night), we transition and evolve that tradition. We present to you the first-ever THINKPINK masquerade gala.”
Representing the Prime Minister and the government was Minister for Health, Elias Kapavore, who addressed the masquerade gala. Kapavore firstly appreciated the PNGCF, especially in connecting with the Provincial Health Authorities. He promised to support the good work.
“This year marks 10 years of the foundation’s tireless advocacy, a decade of service to our people through programmes that have reached thousands across schools, workplaces, and communities. Initiatives such as the healthy teens, cervical cancer education, community outreaches, and trupela man have transformed awareness into action and broken long-standing stigma around cancer. For that, on behalf of our government, I say thank you,” said Minister Kapavore.
Bertha Ngahan is a brave warrior and survivor of breast cancer who hails from West New Britain. Bertha graced the evening with her lifetime experience of living with and fighting cancer. She shared from her heart the importance of having a positive mindset to overcome formidable barriers such as cancer.
Her journey started four years ago when, in the shower, she discovered “something that shouldn’t be there,” she said. Bertha first reached out to a friend, then consulted her company doctor, who encouraged her to go to the hospital for a check-up, which eventually led her to undergo a biopsy. The results came out positive.
Bertha described the fight after the discovery of her condition as hard and long and sometimes lonely because, for her, it was discovered during COVID-19, so she was isolated as well from her family.
But one thing that gave her the courage to face the dilemma head-on was to accept the fact and follow the treatment, including chemotherapy.
Indeed, the fight is ongoing four years on, Bertha is still standing to declare, “I am a survivor!”.
“After my mastectomy, I was re-staged to stage-3 because it had spread to my lymph nodes, but I told myself, this is where it stops, not another centimeter. Now four years later, after four surgeries, countless scans, and hundreds of blood tests, I stand here as that woman in the chemo room. I am a survivor!
“But I also know survival should not be this hard. If we have proper facilities, a one-stop centre for testing, diagnosis, treatments, and psychological support, more of our sisters, our mothers, our daughters would still be here. And I’m happy to hear the new cancer facility is almost done.
“I lost a lot along the way. I lost several dear sisters, I lost my hair, I lost one breast, I lost both my ovaries, but I did not lose myself. The turning point for me came, I think, during my second chemotherapy when a woman walked into the chemo room, smiling, glowing, and said, ‘I am a survivor! That moment I cried and I promised myself that one day that would be me!” she added.
She lost her father and baby sister to cancer, but she declared that this will not go any further in her family. It will stop with her."
PM congratulates Kumuls for Pacific Bowl victory,2/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6678,,Sports,Joy,James Marape,"The Papua New Guinea Kumuls have been praised for retaining the Pacific Bowl title for the third consecutive year after they stormed to a 50-18 win over Fiji Bati at the National Football Stadium in Port Moresby on Saturday, November 1.
Prime Minister James Marape has extended his congratulations to the Kumuls for their commanding victory and third consecutive Pacific Bowl triumph.
“This is more than a sporting victory — it reflects our national character: bold, united, and world-class,” Prime Minister Marape said. “Our Kumuls delivered a performance of immense pride in front of our people.”
The Kumuls stunned Fiji with a blistering start, scoring the first five tries to surge to a 30–0 lead within the opening half of the match. Stand-out performances included second-rower Rhyse Martin, who converted all nine attempts (eight conversions and one penalty) and crossed for a try himself, finishing with 22 points.
Prime Minister Marape also praised the team’s depth of contributors:
“Eight different players crossed for tries — this shows the breadth of talent in our squad and why Papua New Guinea’s future in rugby league is so exciting.”
He acknowledged the visiting Fiji Bati for their competitive spirit and contribution to Pacific rugby league:
“In competition, we sharpen ourselves; in friendship, we strengthen the Pacific community. Congratulations to Fiji, and thank you for the contest.”
Reflecting on the broader significance of the victory, Prime Minister Marape said: “As we mark PNG@50, this win is symbolic of our nation’s journey — building strength from within, inspiring our youth, and projecting our presence on the world stage.”
He reaffirmed the Government’s continued support for rugby league, from grassroots development to elite performance: “Our commitment is to ensure our players, coaches, and administrators have the resources and environment to succeed. This win is a milestone — and the next milestone is even greater.”
Prime Minister Marape extended special commendation to Head Coach Jason Demetriou and the entire Kumuls squad.
“Coach Demetriou has instilled a disciplined and fearless style of play that our nation can rally behind. Congratulations to him and the entire coaching staff on this achievement.”
“To the Kumuls, the fans, the families, the coaches, the officials — you have all played your part in this historic moment. Well done, and may this be the first of many to come.”"
"RPNGC raised over K26,000 for Pinktober",2/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6677,,Health,Trust,Nill,"The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) has raised K26,066 to support the fight against Breast Cancer in Papua New Guinea at their recent fundraiser held at the Boroko Police Station, Port Moresby last week.
As a show of support and solidarity towards Pinktober, Members of the RPNGC staged a short march from the Police Traffic Office at Four Mile to Boroko Police Station, where the fundraising was hosted.
This was an initiative taken by the Human Resource Division of RPNGC to host an annual awareness and fundraising event to mark Pinktober. For this year’s Pinktober, the Logistics Division of RPNGC took the lead in organising the event.
The Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) and Commander for National Capital District (NCD) and Central Province, Benjamin Turi, who took part in the march and fundraising, said breast cancer is everyone’s business, and showing support in the fight against it gives hope to those affected.
The Executive Officer for the Deputy Commissioner of Police Administration, Chief Inspector David Terry, said this is a very significant event for the Constabulary, given the statistics of policewomen who have been diagnosed with Breast Cancer. Some have passed on, while some are still in the fight.
Dr Aina Anota from the Cancer Clinic at the Port Moresby General Hospital, who was invited to the event, said breast cancer not only affects females but males as well. She said about 2-3 per cent of males can be affected with breast cancer; however, the majority are women.
“In our clinic, we see about 300 women per year being diagnosed with breast cancer and come to the clinic for treatment.
“Every year we are diagnosing 20 to 30 new patients of breast cancer, and it can go up to 50 too,” says Dr Anota.
Some signs and symptoms of breast cancer include lumps around the breast area or armpit; it is a painless lump. Other signs include bloody nipple discharge, a change in shape and size of the breast, and skin changes like redness or flaking of the skin on the breast or around the nipple.
Dr Anota said once you notice one of these signs, be quick to get checked. She said breast checks are done every Tuesday with an administration fee of K5 at the Cancer Clinic of Port Moresby General Hospital; however, the treatment is free of charge.
ACP Turi thanked the business houses, namely, King Kakaruk Limited, Okari Limited, Motorist Mart Limited, H.C & YH Leo Limited, the Australian Federal Police, the Executive Management of RPNGC, and everyone for their support towards the Pinktober fundraising."
Fred Hollows Foundation hosts workshop on Climate Resilience,2/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6680,,Health,Anticipation,Nill,"Papua New Guinea is one of the most Climate vulnerable countries in the world as we are looking at hotter temperatures, heavier rainfall during the wet season, longer dry seasons and sea level rise to name a few.
These changes pose serious risks to health infrastructure, especially facilities like the Madang Eye Clinic situated close to the coast.
As Madang and the rest of PNG continues to navigate complex health and environmental challenges, it is imperative to ensure that eye health is recognized as a key part of climate adaptation and resilient health systems.
The Fred Hollows Foundation recently held a one day dissemination workshop at the Madang Resort Hotel to share findings of a Climate Resilient and Environmentally Sustainable Healthcare Facilities Assessment conducted at the Madang Provincial Eye Clinic.
This work was led by a consultancy organization,  Edge Impact, which forms part of the “Building Community Level Climate Resilience in the Pacific” project supported by the Nes Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade through its Climate Finance for Community Resilience Programme.
According to Fred Hollows Foundation Country Manager Priscilla Sine Mal Peter, the Madang Eye Clinic is a standout example of what can be achieved through thoughtful climate adaptation.
“The facility operates on solar power, harvests rainwater and uses an integrated sewerage system. These measures reduce reliance on external resources, lower operational costs and most importantly, ensure continuity of care during climate related disruptions,” stated the Country Manager.
It was made known that the Climate Impact Assessment for the Madang Eye Clinic highlighted several key risks:
•	Heat impacts are affecting energy supply and placing stress on staff and patients. Micro blackouts and water shortages during the dry season are common.
•	Flooding and sea level rise remain concerns due to the clinics proximity to the coast, although the limestone dominant soil profile offers some natural protection.
•	Storms and high winds disrupts outreach services, limiting access to care in remote areas.
•	Cumulative climate impacts, including political instability and limited climate awareness among health workers, pose broader challenges to adaptation.
Fred Hollows Foundation Project Manager Lydia Seta whilst presenting the findings emphasized on more collaboration and positive mind-set in supporting communities as one of the recommendations. Communities were also advised to take ownership of facilities in their vicinity and also being inclusive in their approaches towards gender and disability.
Participants who attended were from the National Department of Health, Madang PHA, Christian Health Services, members from the district health services, partner FPCD, EBC health services in Goroka, other key stakeholders and community members.
“When sight is lost, so too are opportunities for learning, livelihoods and dignity. Embedding eye health in climate resilience discussions ensures Pacific people are not only surviving the climate crisis but living with clear vision and opportunity,” said Ms. Peter.
Chief Executive Officer for Madang Provincial Health Authority Dr. Martin Daimen added that it is imperative for engineers and even everybody to consider climate aspects in the planning of any activity, development or establishments to avoid mishaps in future.
The foundation is non profit dedicated to reducing avoidable blindness and vision impairment across the Pacific. It now operates eight eye clinics across seven countries including PNG, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Kiribati.
In 2024, the Foundation secured funding  for this assessment conducted in its facilities in PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu."
One house – 21 deaths,1/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6673,,Disaster,Sadness,Nill,"It’s been revealed that all 21 people except one who died in the landslide in Kukas Village in Wapenamanda were from the Yabalikin tribe in the Lower Lai constituency and were in Kukas for just a night when they met their fate.
With search and rescue efforts called off at Kukas Village where the landslide occurred, the death toll remains at 21 and all bodies transported to the Paradise Funeral Home in Mt Hagen.
According to Joshua Mangalio from the Provincial Disaster Team, the deceased were in Kukas for a funeral on the 30th of October and were due to return home on the same day. But with the eruption of fresh violence in Mabisanda where the health centre was torched, the road was blocked and the group couldn’t return home as the violence was along their path of travel. They were then hosted by a pastor in a house there when the landslip hit them in the early hours of Friday (31 October, 2025) morning.
About 27 people were accommodated in that house on that fateful night with another 17 accommodated in the pastor’s house. Those 17, the five survivors and the pastor have all been traumatized and are receiving help from EPG.
From reports, 21 casualties were reported and includes one pregnant female, two children under the age of 10 and 18 males, all adults.
The EPG Disaster team has responded with relief supplies and people in the village living along the disaster site have been advised to move to higher grounds due to continuous rainfalls in the area. Police and defence personal continue to patrol the area.
Meantime the relatives of the deceased have agreed to leave the bodies with the EPG Disaster Team"
ENB LLG elections progress well,1/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6672,,Politics,Frustration,Nill,"East New Britain Province’s (ENBP) four districts with 23 Local Level Governments (LLGs) from a total of 382 Wards, have gone into LLG elections.  Polling commenced on Monday October 27 2025 as scheduled nationwide.
A statement from the provincial electoral commission stated that LLG Elections are underway with 137 polling teams attending to voters at 534 polling venues.
ENB voters are voting for ward members and LLG presidents.
Throughout the week, polling was done, and then counting and declarations of newly elected ward members followed the next day.
Some of the wards had their ward members standing unopposed, therefore only took time to vote for LLG presidents.
The election process for ward members is expected to be concluded this Saturday November 1, 2025, and then counting and declarations for LLG presidents get underway on Monday November 3.
Some of the common challenges faced by the four districts during the current LLG Elections are;
1.	The increasing number of informal votes. Despite LPV awareness carried out at the election sites, eligible voters still made mistakes, due to them turning up late and missing out on the awareness.
2.	Names not found in the Common Roll.  Some people who travelled long distances to cast their vote, but found out that their names were not in the Common Roll, leaving them frustrated.
3.	Eligible voters not voting. Many eligible voters whose names were on the Common Roll did not turn up to exercise their voting rights resulting in less number of votes being casted.
4.	Geographical challenges. Areas like Pomio District expect late results due to treacherous conditions which polling officials have to endure.
5.
Police provided security for polling teams who had to travel to areas that are crime hotspots.
Moving forward, the provincial electoral office says more LPV awareness needs to be carried out before the next election, to minimise informal votes."
PM Marape Calls For Responsible Family Planning,1/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6671,,Politics,Fear,James Marape,"Following the official release of the country’ population figure, Prime Minister James Marape has called on Papua New Guineans to embrace responsible family planning, warning that rapid population growth could outpace the nation’s economic capacity if not properly managed.
With country’s population now at 10,185,363, the Prime Minister described the figure as both a milestone and a wake-up call for policy-makers and citizens alike.
In raising concerns about the economic burden of rapid population growth, he urged young couples to consider limiting their families to two or three children, warning that the cost of raising a child to adulthood in modern Papua New Guinea is “an expensive exercise.”
“From conception to adulthood, it can cost up to K5 million to give a child a decent, modern upbringing,” he said. “Parents must think carefully. It is not about how many children you have, but about the quality of life you can provide for them.”
The Prime Minister proposed a national conversation on population control, suggesting a potential policy link between family size and the Government’s Free Education program. Under the proposal, the first two or three children in a family could receive full education support, while additional children would be the responsibility of parents.
“This is a conversation we must have maturely — in churches, communities, and families. A sustainable country must have its economy growing faster than its Population,” PM Marape said.
He also announced plans to make population monitoring a continuous process, urging all provincial administrations to link with health facilities to ensure every birth and death is properly recorded. This, he said, would enable more accurate and efficient future censuses.
Reflecting on Papua New Guinea’s demographic and economic history, PM Marape noted that from Independence in 1975, the population has tripled while economic growth has lagged behind.
“For the first 27 years, our economy grew at less than 0.3 percent while our population rose at around 3 percent. That imbalance cannot continue,” he warned.
As the Prime Minister reaffirmed his government’s commitment to growing the Economy, he appealed for public cooperation in managing population growth.
He reminded citizens that the nation’s Population has expanded dramatically over the decades — from 2,184,991 in 1966, to 2,489,935 in 1971, 3,010,727 in 1980, 3,761,954 in 1990, 5,190,786 in 2000, and 7,275,324 in 2011, reaching 10,185,363 in 2024.
He further noted that the Population has grown by 2.6 percent annually, increasing by approximately 2.9 million people in the past 13 years, underscoring the urgency of managing population growth in line with the nation’s economic strength."
VISA for PALM,1/11/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6670,,Business,Trust,Nill,"In a major boost for Papua New Guineans seeking overseas employment, Pacific International Hospital (PIH) and the Papua New Guinea Labour Mobility Unit (PNG LMU) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to provide affordable and accessible visa medical services for workers under the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) Scheme and New Zealand’s Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Scheme.
The partnership, announced yesterday, aims to streamline the visa medical process by offering discounted packages, expanding service locations, and ensuring faster, high-quality medical assessments for candidates referred by PNG LMU. The initiative is expected to significantly reduce costs and logistical barriers for rural applicants.
“The government remains firmly committed to the labour mobility program. Our national target for mobilizing 8,000 workers by 2025 continues to guide our collective efforts,” said Andrew Oaeke, Secretary of the Department of Treasury. “This partnership represents a practical step towards empowering our citizens with the medical support they need to access job opportunities abroad.”
Visa medicals will be conducted at PIH branches in Port Moresby, Mt. Hagen, Lae, Kokopo, and Goroka. By decentralizing services, the arrangement will save candidates from costly travel to the capital, making the process more inclusive and regionally accessible.
PIH currently has the capacity to conduct over 60 visa medicals per day across its network and can rapidly scale up during peak recruitment periods. The hospital will also offer specialized pre-screening services, particularly for tuberculosis, to improve visa success rates.
In addition to medicals, the partnership supports the development of aged care worker certification and training programs, helping PNG workers upskill for higher-value roles under the PALM Scheme.
“PIH is proud to support PNG’s labour mobility initiatives by ensuring timely, affordable, and high-standard medical services,” said Col. Sandeep Shaligram, CEO of Pacific International Hospital. “Our nationwide presence allows us to reach more candidates, reduce travel-related costs, and help accelerate visa processing times.”
To further streamline the process, PNG LMU will establish an imprest account with PIH to facilitate partial or full payment of visa medical fees. This will simplify transactions for candidates, sponsors, and recruitment hubs, ensuring faster coordination between both institutions.
The agreement will remain in effect for two years, with joint reviews every six months to assess performance and adapt to evolving needs."
Japan Ambassador Visits Tokua,31/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6658,,Business,Trust,Nill,"Tokua airport was built in 1998 by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. It was built after the infamous volcano eruption had destroyed the old Rabaul Airport. Now, for 27 years, Tokua Airport has served the people of East New Britain Province and visitors alike.
The visit of His Excellency Hisanobu Mochizuki, Ambassador of Japan to Papua New Guinea was monumental. He was taken on a tour to the terminal, the runway and the control tower by Tokua Airport Terminal Manager Samson Kakai and staff.
After the airport visit, Ambassador Mochizuki had a meeting with the management of the PNG Cocoa Board. The PNG Cocoa Board took the opportunity to market East New Britain and PNG Cocoa to Japan and the wider Asian Market.
CEO Jesse Anjen, told Ambassador Mochizuki that last year, the national production of cocoa was around 42,000 tons or 80 percent, and it's classified as flavored or fine cocoa.
Anjen further said, about 98 percent of PNG cocoa is exported as raw beans while about 2 percent is produced locally. Most of the beans are sold in Asia and having a partnership with Japan will see them import some of the best cocoa beans from PNG.
Anjen said, “About 98 percent of PNG cocoa is exported as raw beans while about 2 percent is produced locally. Most of the beans are sold in Asia”.
“And having a partnership with Japan will see them importing some of the best cocoa beans from PNG,” he said.
Ambassador Mochizuki later visited Eden Sanctuary Integrated Farm and met with cocoa board officers. They demonstrated how they make cocoa nurseries, budding, harvesting, and fermenting the beans.
Commenting on this experience, Ambassador Mochizuki said Japan would want to import cocoa from PNG among other products."
Cheating law firm reported,31/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6654,,Politics,Anger,"Pila Niningi, Robert Naguri","Member for Bogia, Robert Naguri, today brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Attorney General, Pila Niningi, in Parliament that a series of false claims have been submitted for payment by a certain law firm in Madang Province.
MP Bogia Naguri said the law firm has falsely taken a court order against the Bogia district and has obtained a court decision to solicit money from the district’s bank accounts.
MP Naguri said this is not only happening in the district but also in Usino-Bundi, Middle Ramu, and Madang districts.
Naguri brought this to the attention of Minister Niningi and asked whether he was aware of what was happening. He called on the Minister to explain to the people of Bogia and the rest of the MPs whether this is legal.
In response, Minister Niningi said sometimes lawyers make agreements with the banks and solicit money for projects.
“When you are not watching, they can go to court and obtain orders to come out and get the money. This is one of those cases. He promised to ask the department to investigate the matter and will advise the MP on how to address this important issue.
Minister Niningi said the Madang situation is also happening in other districts, where false claims are used to solicit money"
Sepik Cocoa Wins European Hearts,31/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6655,,Business,Joy,Nill,"Sepik cocoa is earning global attention as European markets, particularly in the United Kingdom, show strong interest in Papua New Guinea’s premium cocoa through initiatives led by the EU-STREIT PNG and UKTP programmes.
International cocoa expert Dr. Zoi Papalexandra from the United Kingdom Trade Partnerships (UKTP) Programme, under the International Trade Centre (ITC), visited Wewak to connect Sepik cocoa producers with niche overseas buyers. Her visit underscores the growing reputation of sustainably produced, high-quality cocoa from the Sepik region.
During her visit, Dr. Papalexandra conducted a hands-on training for 68 local cocoa farmers, agripreneurs, and government extension officers.
The workshop, themed “Cocoa Fermentation & Post-Harvest Practices, Deforestation Regulation Compliance,” was co-facilitated by the EU-STREIT PNG Programme, FAO, and the Cocoa Board of Papua New Guinea (CBPNG).
Participants learned advanced fermentation and drying techniques to improve bean quality and flavour, as well as methods to meet deforestation-free cocoa regulations demanded by European niche markets. They also explored cocoa bean genetics through bean-cutting tests and segregated 18 cocoa varieties to produce diverse chocolate flavours appealing to international buyers.
“I can see high-quality beans being produced here and I commend the cocoa development initiatives in the Sepik,” said Dr. Papalexandra. “ITC will come with between 10 and 15 potential buyers, and this is why we have to produce the kind of beans they want.”
EU-STREIT PNG Programme Coordinator Ali Said Yesuf praised the region’s progress, saying, “This region has made a significant visible leap in cocoa transformation, but the source of sustainability is these overseas buyers showing interest in our cocoas.”
Local agriculture officer Willie Nemani urged participants to use their new skills to produce market-ready cocoa, saying, “Your participation guarantees the sustainability of the programme.”
For many participants, the workshop brought renewed motivation. “Niche markets want specific flavours from specific cocoa varieties,” said Everlyn Sukuina, a female agripreneur from Ambunti-Drekikier District. “We mix cocoa beans during fermentation — this is what I’ve learned and will change.”
With European demand growing, Sepik cocoa producers are positioning themselves to capture international niche markets — a transformation that promises not only better livelihoods but a sustainable future for cocoa farming in Papua New Guinea."
Women Want Water Representation,31/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6657,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"Women across Papua New Guinea are calling for stronger representation and inclusion in decisions around water management, according to new research by WaterAid, World Vision PNG, and the Australian National University’s Development Policy Centre.
The study, which surveyed 147 respondents from Wewak and South Fly districts, along with policymakers and civil society representatives, found that 37% of women identified access to clean water as their biggest challenge, compared to just 19% of men.
Researchers say women are primarily responsible for collecting and managing household water, yet their voices are often missing in governance structures that control this vital resource. One participant from Wewak said, “When water was connected, it made life for us, especially the mothers, easier… before, we used to find it extremely difficult to access water for our basic needs.”
The report highlights that while District WaSH Committees (DWCs) have been established in selected provinces to improve service delivery, women’s participation in these bodies remains limited.
Associate Professor Grant Walton from ANU’s Development Policy Centre noted that including women and community groups in decision-making would lead to more effective and sustainable outcomes. “Women want stronger community collaboration and recognition of their role in managing water resources,” he said.
The research also found that 40% of women preferred community-led approaches to water governance, compared to 20% of men, reflecting a broader desire for inclusivity and empowerment.
As PNG works to expand its DWCs, experts believe ensuring women’s active involvement will not only improve WaSH outcomes but also strengthen community resilience and wellbeing.
The research was supported by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research and published by the Development Policy Centre at ANU."

Continuous blackout damages ANGAU genset,31/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6663,,Health,Sadness,Nill,"Constant power outages damage electric goods, especially the power surges that occur when electricity is restored.
This was the case with the standby generators at the ANGAU Memorial Provincial Hospital, in Lae.
The ANGAU Memorial Provincial Hospital has come under scrutiny after the death of five patients on October 19, 2025, when the city experienced another blackout and the standby generator failed to kick in.
Chief Executive Officer of the Morobe Provincial Health Authority, Dr Kipas Binga, outlined that it was a “mechanical issue” that has proven to be a major challenge for the hospital’s operation due to the frequent blackouts that are being faced not only in Morobe, but nationwide.
He explained that ANGAU hospital currently has two systems of power; PNG Power Ltd as the main source of power and a standby generator, known as the central energy plant.
“Unlike in the past, in the old ANGAU, we used to have little generators that looked after different sections but as part of this redevelopment, the whole of the power – especially to the new buildings and most of ANGAU – is channelled through what we call the central energy plant,” Dr Binga explained to Lae media.
“The power for the hospital, when it takes on a full load, will take about 800-850 kilo-volt-ampere (kVA). We’ve got three big generators at the back. One generator is about 1,000kVA so with three gensets, we have about 3,000kVA that is available for the hospital.
“The idea is for one to kick in when the power goes off, and it’s synchronised. When one goes off, another one comes on.
“Our main problem was, because of the switch on, switch off – regular on and off of PNG Power – the breaker kept closing in and going out and eventually, it led to mechanical wear and tear.”
Dr Binga said because a component was fried, it failed to detect the power outage that occurred around 10pm on Saturday October 18, 2025.
A technical team that was on site identified the issue with the breaker and because it was a high-voltage area, contractors had to be called in. Dr Binga said work started on Sunday morning, and took approximately 20 hours to resolve the issue.
“What we are doing now is, we are running the hospital on generators and fuel is a big, big concern for us now,” he continued.
“The generators are chewing about 4,000-5,000 litres in 24 hours. That’s a lot of money and we are struggling to find money to sustain our services while we try to sort out the issue with the breaker.
“The breaker, unfortunately, cannot be sourced locally, according to our technical team. It has to be sourced outside. We are thankful to DFAT and our other partners who have come on board to try and see how we can get the parts in.”"

BCFW Demands Wage Enforcement,31/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6661,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"The Business Coalition for Women (BCFW) is calling on the Department of Treasury to ensure that the newly announced K5.00 national minimum wage—set to take effect on January 1, 2026—is backed by strong enforcement mechanisms and adequate funding.
While the government’s decision to raise the minimum wage from K3.50 to K5.00 per hour has been praised as a bold step toward economic equity, the BCFW warns that without proper enforcement, the policy risks being ineffective.
BCFW Executive Director Evonne Kennedy stressed, “A law without enforcement is merely a suggestion.”
She said widespread reports reveal that some employers already fail to comply with the current rate, fueling a “grey economy” where workers remain underpaid.
In its 2026 National Budget submission, BCFW urged the Treasury to prioritise funding for the Department of Labour and Industrial Relations to develop and maintain a robust reporting and compliance mechanism for wage violations.
“This investment will not only safeguard workers from exploitation but will also ensure fair competition for law-abiding businesses,” Kennedy said, adding that a well-resourced enforcement system is crucial to maintaining the integrity of PNG’s labour market and supporting inclusive economic growth.
The coalition’s call serves as a reminder that raising wages must go hand-in-hand with accountability, ensuring that every Papua New Guinean worker benefits from fair and lawful pay."
Grieving family petitions authorities,30/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6643,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"The relatives of the late 62-year-old Aiwa Ape from Bokapai village, Koinambe LLG of Jiwaka Province, have visited the Central Provincial Police headquarters and aired their grievances regarding why their father, who went missing on October 3 and was later found dead on October 14 at Brown River.
The family said they received little support from Central leaders. In a petition, the family of the deceased raised concerns that their father, who was conducting his normal business, was kidnapped, murdered, and had his vehicle taken away from him. They stated that the old man was unfortunate to lose his life and property, and that the vehicle driven to Brown River was not returned because some parts are missing.
""This shows how disrespectful these people are, and the family demands a good explanation from the community leaders, including the national leaders. The vehicle had been in the village for days, and no one bothered to report it to the police until the police, after seeing a Facebook post, went and recovered the vehicle. After that, they found the body of my father and arrested five suspects, which we are happy about with the police.
“We demand the leaders whose people did this to our father to come address us on how best we can deal with the body of our late father. We were not prepared for his death, and we cannot do much to take his body to Jiwaka,"" Hilary Aiwa, the son of the late Ape, said.
He added that the police, the Governor of Central, Kairuku, and Hiri Koiari MP must come forward and say something about what their people did to their father. He stated that the family now demands One Million Kina from the people who brutally murdered him and also requests that his car be returned to the family within five working days, starting yesterday, Wednesday, October 29.
Central Provincial Police Commander Superintendent Joseph Salle, when responding to the family’s grievances, accepted their petition. He said the police are doing their best to ensure justice is served.
Supt Salle further added that the family must work closely with the police and must not disturb the witnesses, who are assisting the police with the ongoing investigation."
New CEO Promises Discipline Drive,30/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6647,,Politics,Trust,Kerenga Kua,"In a decisive leadership change for the Sinasina-Yonggomugl District of Simbu Province, local MP Kerenga Kua officially installed Jack Atte Kerenga Kapa as the new Acting District Chief Executive Officer, replacing Obert Waura, who was terminated for breaching the Public Service Management Act.
The handover ceremony was held yesterday at the MP’s residence on Ega Street in Kundiawa, where Mr. Waura formally handed over the office keys and district vehicle keys to his successor. The change marks a new chapter for the district administration, emphasizing accountability and adherence to public service ethics.
According to the Simbu Provincial Administration’s Human Resource Division, Mr. Waura’s termination followed disciplinary offences under Section 15.19 of the Public Service Management Act, which outlines penalties for misconduct by public officers.
Speaking at the event, MP Kua urged public servants to maintain professionalism and unity for effective service delivery.
“Public service is about discipline and teamwork,” he said. “We must work together with honesty and respect for the law to deliver to our people.”
Deputy Provincial Administrator for Field Services, Chris Mondo, echoed the call, reminding all officers that their roles are bound by the law.
“We are servants of the people,” Mr. Mondo stated. “The Public Service Act covers us all, and it is our duty to uphold its standards.”

GBV Gaining Stronger Access to Justice,30/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6644,,Social,Trust,Nill,"Survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) are gaining access to justice, thanks to the Regina Sagu Foundation’s expanding legal aid program.
The foundation reported securing 36 protection orders over the past two years, despite facing resistance from powerful perpetrators.
This was highlighted during the Australian Broadcasting Corporation International Development Papua New Guinea Media Development Initiative (ABCID PNG–MDI) Networking and Learning Engagement Event, held on October 24 in Port Moresby.
Themed Safe Spaces, Strong Voices, the event brought together media professionals and civil society organizations working to address violence, reintegration, and community healing.
Presenting on behalf of the Regina Sagu Foundation, Program Officer Tommy Aiyok shared that in 2024, the foundation secured 19 interim protection orders (IPOs), one permanent protection order (PPO), and supported five pending cases. In 2025, the team has so far obtained 11 IPOs and two PPOs, with five more cases underway. Six women have also received legal support through outreach.
“These are not just numbers,” Aiyok said. “Some perpetrators are very powerful. They try to overrun the victims, but our lawyers have stood firm.”
The foundation emphasized the need for stronger collaboration with community-based organizations (CBOs). While CBOs excel at case management, many lack the capacity to represent survivors in court. “We can go to court. They can manage cases. Together, we can prevent GBV,” Aiyok added.
Currently operating in Port Moresby, the Regina Sagu Foundation plans to expand its pro bono legal services to Enga Province and Telefomin in Sandaun. Key partners include Emunah Law Firm, Wantok Tok Radio Light, and Wabag Women’s SME Association, Mi Bank, and Centre for Excellence in Financial Inclusion.
Aiyok also stressed the importance of awareness-building, especially among educators. “Many teachers didn’t understand the purpose of protection orders until we ran workshops. Now they see the impact.”
Although the Department of Justice and Attorney General were not present at the event, the Regina Sagu Foundation’s message was clear: legal aid must be accessible, survivor-centered, and community-driven.
Judge Regina Sagu was a trailblazer in Papua New Guinea’s legal sector, known for her commitment to justice and protection for vulnerable groups. Her legacy lives on through the Regina Sagu Foundation, which provides pro bono legal services, community outreach, and advocacy for GBV survivors across the country."
Parliament passes University of Medicine Bill,30/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6649,,Health,Joy,James Marape,"The National Parliament today passed the Papua New Guinea University of Medicine and Health Sciences Bill 2025 by an absolute majority of 76 votes to nil.
This legislation will establish the country’s first dedicated medical university, a major reform in PNG's national education and health system.
Prime Minister James Marape, when welcoming the absolute vote on the Bill by Members of Parliament, stated: “Today, we make history; We have now passed a law that secures our country’s medical future. This university will stand as a testament to our commitment to education, health, and service to our people.”
The Prime Minister has assured the nation that the government will ensure the standalone medical university is properly funded, equipped, and staffed to the highest standard.
The new university, which is expected to be fully operational by 2030, will take over the functions currently managed under the University of Papua New Guinea’s School of Medicine and Health Sciences.
It will focus on producing highly trained doctors, health specialists, and technical professionals to meet the growing health care needs of our country and the region.
Prime Minister James Marape commended the Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, Kinoka Feo, and his predecessors for their effort in bringing the vision to fruition.
“There is no greater investment than investing in doctors, laboratory technicians, and the health infrastructure of our nation,” the Prime Minister stated.
“Papua New Guinea has faced many challenges in the health sector. At one point during the COVID-19 pandemic, our country of almost 10 million people had only 44 oxygen-ventilated beds and a doctor-to-patient ratio of roughly one to twenty thousand.
This new institution is a structural readjustment that will help bridge that gap.”
He thanked the University of Papua New Guinea’s leadership under Chancellor Sir Robert Igara for their support in the transition process.
Marape highlighted that the establishment of the medical university would link existing health training institutions, such as nursing colleges and community health worker schools, while creating a clear pathway for developing and nurturing medical professionals.
“Our country is known for producing some of the Pacific’s most qualified medical workers,” he said.
“This university will strengthen that reputation. It will train, equip, and skill more health workers to serve our people and reduce the need for citizens to seek costly medical treatment overseas.”
Marape noted that the country’s growing medical achievements, citing the nation’s first successful kidney transplant and heart bypass operations in recent years, have already saved over a thousand patients from travelling abroad for treatment.
He also commended the academic leadership and staff of the medical faculty for their dedication. The PM called on the Public Service and Higher Education ministry to ensure lecturers and trainers are well compensated.
Meantime, Prime Minister Marape announced that the new university is open for students from other Pacific Island nations, in promoting regional cooperation and solidarity."

Spokesperson, Chief Inspector David Terry said, the RPNGC is also leading the fight against cancer, which has also affected members of the police force, mainly police women.
“Pinktober is an international event hosted in various countries in the world to support the fight against breast cancer,” Terry said. “The RPNGC HR division hosted the event to commemorate and pay tribute to most of our police women who fight against breast cancer, including other forms of cancer as well.”
“We aim to raise more than we did last year, but it depends on the turnout of the people.”
In a statement, Deputy Commissioner and Chief of Police Administration, Dr. Philip Mitna, appealed to NCD residents and corporate entities to support this worthy cause.
He said anyone in society can one day fall victim to cancer and that the PinkTober initiative is uniting people in the fight against this killer disease."

A grieving family’s search for answers,29/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6624,,Sadness,Grief,Nill,"A 20-year-old young man, filled with hope and a sense of purpose, bid his family farewell as he excitedly packed his bags and travelled to another province to continue the next chapter of his education.
Being the eldest son, he was the first to leave the nest despite his mother’s anxious pleas for him to enrol in an institution near home, in Port Moresby.
The family’s celebration of a milestone soon turned to shock and horror when the body of their son and brother, Malachi Jude Kalupio, was found in his room at the Bulolo Forestry College, in Morobe Province.
“He attended La Salle Technical Secondary School last year,” said late Malachi’s mother, Victoria Kalupio. “He was one of the pioneer Grade 12 students there, taking all science courses.
“His interest was food technology but because of his Grade Point Average, he was offered space at the Bulolo Forestry College.
“I was really against it at first,” she shared. “I was not comfortable having him leave home, being away from me because he’s the first born and he’s never been away from me and the family.”
The late Malachi was initially offered a merit-based scholarship from the Datec Learning Centre. While he was in the process of registering there, he received another offer from the Bulolo-based college.
“Even though I was against it, I cannot stop him from achieving his dreams. So, I just let him go, hoping that he’d be safe,” shared his mother.
“That was in late January 2025. I took him to Lae with my parents to leave him on campus.”
Kalupio shared that while they all had arrived at the Nadzab Tomodachi International Airport, her son opted to get on the college bus instead of continuing the journey up the Bulolo Highway with his mother and grandparents.
They were sad but happy to see that he was looking forward to starting a new chapter in a new environment and with new friends.
Seven months into college and Ms. Kalupio received a call from an unregistered mobile number.
“It was on September 18th when I got the call at 8.46am. A female student called and said: ‘Oh, it’s about your son, Malachi. He was put on a mattress, covered up and they took him out’.
“I said ‘no no no, you have to check properly. How was he covered up?’ She said wait. When I hung up, I called my son’s phone but it kept ringing out. I called one of the students there but he did not pick up the call.
“Later at 8.53am, his female friend called again and said: ‘Malachi was covered from head to toe. They said it’s suicide.’”
The grief-stricken mother expressed disbelief that her fun-loving son, who had just performed during the school’s Independence celebrations, would take his own life.
She refused to believe her son’s friends.
While minutes ticked into hours, the Kalupio family’s world came to a standstill as they waited on the school administration to contact them.
“It wasn’t until 10am when the administration called and told me that my son had committed suicide,” she continued. “I just snapped at them and said, you don’t tell me my son is suicidal. He’s not! We have no reason to believe that he’s suicidal.”
Kalupio referred to her son’s dancing video that has since gone viral on social media, saying he had sent that to them on September 17, and it showed that he was clearly enjoying himself and having a good time.
“They told me that he had hung himself using an electric jug’s cord but I told them that I had bought his appliances myself and the cord was too small and was not long enough for someone to hang themselves with.”
Kalupio then insisted that they tell her where her son was.
“They told me that they took him to the funeral home so I thought there was a funeral home in Bulolo. I then refused to talk to anyone from the school because I was furious with the way they were handling things. So, my sister and dad were the ones who were in contact with the administration.
“So, on Thursday, September 18th, my sister flew to Lae and they met with the school representatives at the funeral home at 14-Mile. They handed my son’s body over.
“They had taken my son’s body from Bulolo to Lae at 1.30pm that day. However, when we were communicating in the morning, they told me that he was at the funeral home but that wasn’t true. They kept him on campus, washed him and dressed him up. Who gave them the authority to do that? They even had a private viewing of the body. Who authorised that? I did not give my consent.”
The Kalupio family even questioned the initial police report that was furnished by a police officer in Bulolo, believed to be a reservist.
“The manner in which they dealt with the scene was questionable. They tampered with evidence because they said they had to cut the cord.”
The family voiced their disappointment with how the school handled the late Malachi’s case.
While she thanked the school for assisting with her son’s repatriation from Lae to Port Moresby, she expressed concern that the school nurse handed them their late son’s death certificate with the cause of death as “suicide”.
However, after his post-mortem, it was established that the cause of death was “strangulation”.
“The doctor suggested that more than four people were involved in his death.”
Ms. Kalupio flew to Lae and handed a letter, dated October 9th, 2025, to the PNG University of Technology’s vice chancellor, calling for answers and accountability surrounding the death of the late Malachi.
While the university is yet to respond to the family, they have indicated to Lae media that a statement will be furnished soon.
The family has called for the case to be removed from Bulolo police and brought to main headquarters in Lae.
They have also called for a review of the campus’ safety and emergency response protocols, and the implementation of stronger safety and security measures, with Ms. Kalupio highlighting that there are big gaps in the fencing behind the students' dormitory.
“Our family needs closure,” she appealed.
“We need to know what happened to our son.”
The late Malachi is survived by his grandparents, parents, and two younger siblings."
"No polling, new wards disputed",29/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6636,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"The community of Anglimp Kuli electorate in Jiwaka Province did not conduct the local level government elections due to discrepancies with the establishment of 14 new wards.
Since the establishment of the new wards, the ward councils and leaders have written to the provincial and local level government, the Electoral Commission, and other relevant authorities to explain the last-minute additions (wards) ahead of the LLG elections.
According to Anglimp Kuli spokesman, Jonathan Wii, they have aired their grievances by writing to the concerned authorities, but have not received any good feedback since then. Now, with the LLG elections underway nationwide, the community in Anglimp Kuli is reluctant to vote, as their grievances have not been addressed.
On Tuesday, October 28, a petition was presented during a peaceful protest in Banz. Wii said the petition contained immediate action against the establishment of the wards. It demanded access to the electoral roll 2025 for the new wards created, to see if there are ‘ghost names’ on the electoral roll.
“We did follow due processes to air our grievances, but it was ignored. Now, the people cannot go into polling because of this issue,” he said.
Wii clarified that on March 31, 2025, they lodged a judicial review at the National Court but were denied their rights to a fair hearing, as their matter was not put before a judge to preside.
He said, “Should this issue be addressed, the people will conduct the elections; if not, those responsible must declare their LLG election as failed and conduct a new election next year.”"
Over 100 foreign nationals face deportation,29/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6635,,Politics,Anger,John Rosso,"Over 100 foreign nationals are facing deportation after they were apprehended in a joint immigration and police operation in Morobe’s mining districts of Bulolo and Wau-Waria.
Immigration Minister and Lae MP, John Rosso, confirmed that 103 foreign nationals were found working in the alluvial mining sector, a reserved activity for PNG citizens.
They were apprehended and taken to the Lae Top Town police station yesterday (Tuesday, October 28th).
“They were sent to Port Moresby today to be processed, assessed, deported and charged or fined, depending on the type of breaches and laws broken,” said Rosso.
“I continue to take a hard-line stance that foreign nationals in PNG should abide by our laws, and breaches will result in apprehension and deportation.
“Respect our country's laws and regulations.
“Investors and foreign nationals who abide by our laws are welcome and have nothing to worry about.”
Rosso further pointed out to critics that Immigration is working behind the scene to hold to account those in breach of their visa conditions and PNG’s immigration laws.
This is not the first case this year. In June, 11 Chinese nationals were arrested for unauthorised alluvial mining using machinery.
The Chinese nationals were allegedly conducting illegal operations in Wau, where the Wau Mineral Resources Authority branch is located."
Critical failures at ANGAU hospital scrutinized in Parliament,29/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6631,,Health,Sadness,"Elias Kapavore, Patrick Basa","ANGAU Hospital in Lae City is caring for more Papua New Guineans than expected, is experiencing a shortage of drugs and insufficient manpower to manage the vast medical demands, and also lacks a reliable power supply to perform procedures and treatments.
Kabwum MP, Patrick Basa, in today’s Parliament session raised a question to the Minister for Health, Elias Kapavore, if he was aware that two weeks ago, during a prolonged power blackout in Lae city, seven patients lost their lives at the ANGAU General Hospital.
He queried in Parliament, “If it is the power issue, then why is the standby generator not working to support the important life-saving equipment in operation during the critical moments?”
“If it is an issue of electricity failure, then the minister responsible for energy should also respond and explain why there is no adequate power supply to keep critical life-saving equipment operating in a very important hospital as ANGAU?
“Could it be that the Provincial Health Authority is not performing its role well?” If the deaths are related to insufficient medical supply for treatment, then you must tell us why seven people must die during the same period of blackout.”
MP Basa said it seems like the provincial health authority is not controlling the supply of medicine properly and directing it into the rural areas of Morobe. Therefore, he said many people are dying in the districts, but the exact numbers are not being revealed.
In response, Minister Kapavore said as of October 22, from the operational funds, K569 million was released to all PHAs this year, and today, releasing about K347 million, Morobe, the PHA received about 68 per cent out of all PHAs.
Kapavore stated that in terms of medical supplies, for Morobe province and ANGAU, all have been delivered to Area Medical Stores last week.
“Now the onus is on the primary health care health facilities to put their order for medical drugs to the Area Medical Stores. It should also be noted that the Area Medical Store in Lae was burnt down last year, but the government allocated K20 million this year to rebuild the AMS. To date, K15 million has been released, and the tender process is in progress.”"
Bulolo Highway critical for connectivity: Basil Jr,29/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6633,,Business,Concern,Sam Basil,"Member for Bulolo Sam Basil Jnr, presented a petition in Parliament today, Wednesday, October 29, 2025, on behalf of the Farmers and Settlers Association in his electorate and other adjoining districts on the critical condition of the Bulolo Highway.
Basil Jnr presented the petition in collaboration with other key industry bodies, including the Poultry Association, Lae Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Papua New Guinea Mines and Petroleum, to seek urgent attention to the deteriorating condition of the Bulolo Highway.
He said the highway is a critical infrastructure treated as a lifeline for a major economic sector such as poultry, forestry, and mining that contribute to Papua New Guinea’s economic development.
The MP added that the highway is also good for the movement of goods and services, within the districts of Huon Gulf, Wau-Waria and Bulolo, and Menyamya, extending connections to remote communities such as Kaintiba, and neighbouring Kerema, Gulf Province and Marawaka in Eastern Highlands Province.
The highway also supports coffee growers, small businesses, and local communities whose livelihoods depend on reliable access to markets and services.
Basil Jnr stressed that the current state of disrepair and lack of consistent maintenance has raised serious concerns among the stakeholders, threatening economic activity and public safety, and regional development.
He requested for privatisation of the rehabilitation and maintenance of the Bulolo Highway to ensure continued growth and connectivity for the people and industries that rely on it.
The petition requests;
•	Immediate assessment of the current condition of the Bulolo Highway by the Department of Works and Highways
•	Allocation of emergency funding to ensure critical, safe, and reliable access
•	Development of a long-term maintenance strategy in consultation with industry stakeholders and affected communities, and
•	 Consider a public-private partnership to support infrastructure sustainability.
Basil Jnr said the Bulolo Highway is a strategic asset for Papua New Guinea’s economy and social development, so addressing its current state is not only a matter of infrastructure but of national interest; and prompt action will safeguard livelihood, support industry goals, and reinforce regional connectivity."

Review of the form and system of government report tabled,29/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6639,,Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has presented the final report on the ""Review of the Form and System of Government: Election of the Prime Minister by the People"" in Parliament today.
This significant document, prepared by the Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC), examines the current governmental framework in Papua New Guinea and proposes potential reforms regarding the process of electing the Prime Minister.
The report aims to enhance democratic governance by exploring alternative systems for electing the Prime Minister that could lead to greater accountability and representation.
“As I present this Report, I want this House to note that whether you are sitting on the opposition side or the Government side, the Report speaks to all of us as it carries the voice of our people and their concerns and cries of the hardship and challenges they have been facing over the years under the current system of government.
“Papua New Guinea has gone through different phases in trialing various systems of government since Independence. After nearly 50 years of independence, we now have a comprehensive report that sets the direction for the future of this country,” said Marape.
The Prime Minister further emphasized the importance of this review in fostering a more responsive and transparent government to better serve the needs of the citizens.
“This report before the Parliament came about after my government tasked the CLRC to undertake a review or inquiry, to assess the form and system of government and propose necessary recommendations back to the Government.
The review had to be undertaken because important considerations and issues that lingered for nearly 50 years needed addressing, both systematically and structurally.
“Any government of a country will always continue to assess and feel the pulse of the society and see whether it is in fact meeting the goals to achieve its visions.”
As discussions unfold in Parliament, the report is expected to ignite debates about the future direction of the country’s political structure and electoral processes, marking a crucial step towards potential constitutional reforms.
Furthermore, Marape said as a responsible government, his government decided that the country must pause and reflect as it reaches 50 years of existence as a nation and see whether the country is on the right path and doing the right thing to achieve our goals under our national strategies, such as the Medium-Term Development Plans, the Vision 2050, the National Goals and Directive Principles and the Constitution.
The Government, through NEC Decision 395 of 2021, through the Head of State, directed CLRC to undertake this review, looking at the relevant laws such as the National Constitution, Organic Law on provincial and Local-level Government, as well as numerous Acts of Parliament.
The CLRC was to report back to the NEC within 18 months.
Specific and very relevant Terms of Reference were issued to CLRC to consider in this Review.
These TORs are:
1.	Is the form and system of Government suitable for a modern Papua New Guinea, as it moves into its 50th Anniversary? If not, what are the alternatives?
2.	Should the Prime Minister be elected by the people?
3.	Should we have a bicameral Parliament? Who should be elected to the lower and upper houses?
4.	Should we keep the three-tier system of Government? If not, what are the alternatives?
5.	How best should women be represented in Parliament?
6.	What areas of the electoral system (such as the qualifications for election, criteria for nomination, election period, and election disputes) should be improved for a modern Papua New Guinea? And
7.	How best can we improve the political party system?
The TORs were too broad, and therefore, to give a sharp focus, the broad Terms of Reference were rescoped to only four thematic areas, which are:
a)	System of Government - that covers the Three-tier system of Government in PNG;
b)	Parliamentary System — regarding the unicameral and bicameral design of the Legislature;
c)	Head of State —with reference to the British Monarch under Section 82 of the Constitution; and
d)	Election of the Prime Minister — which is about the way the Prime Minister is nominated and elected on the floor of Parliament.
Following the launch of the Review in February 2023, CLRC, together with representatives of sister government agency stakeholders, took the seven Terms of Reference out to the people to gauge their views during the nationwide consultation in all 21 provinces and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville between March and July 2023.
Following detailed analysis of all the information collected in the cause of the nationwide consultation, the literature reviews, comparison with government systems of other countries, and reference to relevant laws, polices, existing frameworks as well as CLRC's two previous reports on Constitutional Directive 1 and 2, CLRC, in its wisdom, was able to come up with a set of best possible recommendations that relate to the seven Terms of References.
The recommendations in CLRC's view are sound, practical and appropriate that best address the issues the Review was intended to address.
The Report provides a total of seven (7) key recommendations with their relevant sub recommendations on fundamental areas of the system of government, covering the Election of the Prime Minister, the three-tier system of government, the parliamentary system, Head of State, the women representation in Parliament, electoral system, and the political party system.
The recommendations are as follows:
I.	Change the current system of government from a Three-tier system to a Two-tier System.
II.	PNG should change its Head of State from a Constitutional Monarchy to a Non-Executive President;
III.	The People of Papua New Guinea must directly elect the Prime Minister through the political party with the greatest number of elected MPs endorsed by that party, and the Head of State must sanction the Leader of that political party as the Prime Minister, with a full term of Government;
IV.	Improving the electoral system and processes for a modern PNG;
V.	Creating more opportunities for women's representation in Parliament through special measures, including reserved seats, nominated seats, and a quota system;
VI.	Improve the political party system; and
VII.	PNG should adopt a bicameral parliamentary system.
Several Terms of References especially the TORs on women representation in Parliament, electoral system, and political party system repeated the TORs CLRC had addressed in the previous Constitutional Directives (Constitutional Directive No. 1 on the Review of the Organic Law on Provincial and Local- level Governments and Constitutional Directive No. 2 on the Review of the Organic Law on National and Local-level Government Elections)."
Kapavore clarifies shortage of medical drugs,28/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6622,,Health,Sadness,"Douglas Tomuriesa, Elias Kapavore","Minister for Health Elias Kapavore has admitted that almost K150 million of the K295 million allocated to the National Department of Health in this year's budget has been disbursed, and while the balance is yet to be given, it is affecting the supply of medical drugs in the country.
Kapavore revealed this during today’s Parliament session’s question without notice.
Minister Kapavore was responding to questions raised by the Leader of Opposition and MP for Kiriwina-Goodenough, Douglas Tomuriesa, about the extreme shortage of drugs in the last few weeks across the country, leading to deaths in health facilities.
Tomuriesa referred to queries he received from chief executive officers of various provincial health authorities, stating the critical drug shortage in health care facilities throughout the country.
These concerns cover all provincial hospitals, as well as church agency-run health facilities. Tomuriesa said it is not right for people to be dying from curable diseases.
“Is it a lack of funds that’s causing this lack of drugs in the health facilities, or is it that money meant for health is being redirected to other areas that’s causing this?” Tomuriesa queried.
Kapavore responded that, firstly, it is not a lack of funding, but the delay in disbursing this money; and he commented further that this year the government has allocated K295 million towards medical supplies to the country.
He said that recent information he received, over K150 million of this allocation has been disbursed to the health sector. He also added that last week, another K50 million was released by the government to the health sector.
Kapavore admits that the government is fully aware of the critical situation regarding drug shortages and they are trying their best to ensure that medical supplies are being procured are sent to the provincial medical stores.
Kapavore said curative health directors from hospitals have been notifying the department, and the authorities are fully aware of updated information from CEOs and medical supplies directors.
He admits that five of the area medical stores there are only 60 per cent of what is required now in store, but 40 per cent is lacking; however, on a positive note, a procurement process is underway.
The health minister said there is a plan to reach about 70 per cent to 80 per cent of provincial medical supplies to provincial medical stores by the end of 2025 and the first part of 2026.
Minister Kapavore also noted the variety of challenges that the health sector is facing in the delivery of medical supplies to the area medical stores, such as roadblocks along the national highways, especially in the highlands region.
He appeals to the people on the ground to cooperate and let the trucks carrying medical supplies go through. These challenges include theft of medical supplies that is happening while drugs are on the road.
Kapavore said, despite various challenges, the health department is trying its best to secure medical supplies."
"NISIT, Customs sign strategic MoU",28/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6621,,Business,Trust,Nill,"National Institute of Standards & Industrial Technology (NISIT) has signed a historical Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with PNG Customs services on Monday this week.
NISIT, established in 1993 by and ACT of Parliament as ‘NISIT Act 1993’ serves as the legal foundation for the institute, outlining its mandate to oversee technical standards, metrology, conformity assessment, productivity and technical barriers to trade in PNG.
“So far we have a wide network of partnerships with both government and industry to ensure that there is well represented from each sector regarding a standard,” Joe Panga explained.
With the MoU, the Chief Commissioner of Customs Services will now sit on the board of NISIT. This will bring value to their operations by giving them access to industries across the country where the PNG Customs are covering.
The Chief Commissioner of Customs, David Towe said they have collaborated with many other relevant state agencies and private sector but now aligning Customs policies and standards with the NISIT is very strategic.
He sees this partnership between NISIT and Customs would be very strategic in improving compliance and enforcing their regulatory arrangements, as in recent times there have been issues of non -compliance.
He told the NISIT Acting Director General that he would like Customs to engage with NISIT to know they have different standards which they want to be able to use for the Customs laws.
“Once your standard become our standard then once our legal receive is completed,” he said. “We want those standards to be incorporated into our law so that whoever that we issue a license to must be certified by NISIT.”
He said they currently don’t have expertise available to do the accreditation. Partnering with NISIT is very convenient."

Polling commences for LLG elections,27/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6599,,Politics,Anticipation,Nill,"Polling for Local Level Government elections commenced today, Monday October 27, 2025.
“The PNGEC acknowledges the public’s strong interest in timely elections, and remains fully committed to progressing these elections and polling shall commence this week starting Monday 27 October 2027,” said PNG Electoral Commission Simon Sinai said in a media release issued today.
Sinai said the delays were caused by number of factors, including the new proclamations – the creation of new wards and LLGs in the country on the eve of the election – a process managed by the Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs.
“This has placed extra workload on the provincial electoral staff to identify and create new rolls for the new wards and LLGs through the voter alignment process using the existing rolls,” Sinai explained.
Polling will end on November 8, 2025 and counting begins November 09.
LLG election writs will be returned on Friday November 21, 2025."

Unlike previous elections where isolated incidents disrupted voting, this year’s operation focuses on strategic placement of officers and closer collaboration between the police, Electoral Commission, and community leaders.
The deployment plan assigns 46 officers to Mekeo, 22 to Kairuku, and 16 to Kuni, with teams already stationed at critical points to deter any potential disturbances.
“We are working closely with the Electoral Commission, local leaders, and community elders to make sure everything runs smoothly. Our officers will be stationed at all critical points to respond quickly to any disturbance,” Sgt Hoiba added.

Smooth LLG polling in Lae,27/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6608,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"Polling for the 2025 Local Level Government elections began today in the 16 wards of Lae district, in Morobe Province.
For Ward 2 at Top Town, in the Lae Urban LLG covering the Ward Service Office Area, polling officials, led by presiding officer Timothy Holingu, commenced at 9am, with Holingu expecting a turnout of 500 voters for the area.
Polling started peacefully for Ward Two residents from the streets of Gannet, Falcon, Eagle, Crane, Plover, Swift, Tern, Quail, Hornbill, and especially those near the Huonville Primary School.
Moving to Ahi LLG, Ward Two of West Butibam polled at the Butibam Resource Centre, under the watchful eyes of polling team number 147.
Presiding officer, Basoka Mangheyuc, said matters had to be sorted hence polling started after 8am.
“We expected 1,170 voters; 618 males and 552 females,” said Mangheyuc.
“We had a little bit of a challenge; this is concerning our assistant presiding officer. The scrutineers and candidates asked me to swap and replace her, so we did that. So, our assistant presiding officer was sent to Butibam East, and we had to pull the assistant presiding officer from there to here. We had to swap for the sake of transparency.”
Lae Urban’s Ward Five, at the PNG University of Technology, had two polling venues; the polling venue near the coffee shop was under polling team 227, while the one opposite the uni force office was manned by polling team 228.
Presiding officer of polling team 228, Solomon Bulu, outlined that the only glitch today was the late delivery of polling materials from the Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium, hence their two-hour late start at 10am.
“Due to the election being deferred a couple of times, it’s quite tough with us the polling officials,” said Bulu. “Polling officials were selected last minute so we were not prepared for that. So, we had to attend our training for a day at the eleventh hour and we came to the polling site. That was due to things beyond our control.”
Polling team 228 – consisting of seven officials and three law enforcers – is anticipating 1,000 voters for the one-day polling, which is set to close at 6pm."

LLG processes need reviewing: Sinai,27/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6600,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai has raised concerns that the Local Level Government processes need reviewing so that the legal requirements for creating new wards and LLGs are strictly managed and guided by law and implemented within a fixed timeline.
Sinai said one of the delays and deferral of the LLG elections was being the new proclamations – creation of new wards and LLGs in the country on the eve of the election, a process managed by the Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs.
“This has placed extra workload on the provincial electoral staff to identify and create new rolls for the new wards and LLGs through the voter alignment process using the existing rolls.”
“As such it is imperative that the administrative and technical issues identified herein be fully addressed in order to guarantee the special rights of eligible citizens under Section 50 of the Constitution, namely the right to vote and stand for public office.
“These are legal issues that needs to be handled with care. Such as identifying a voter for the new ward and creating a new roll.
“Once you have separated the voters according to the new wards from the existing rolls, you then take into account new voters who are not on the roll but turned 18 and are eligible to vote.
“The 2022 Electoral Roll can be used as the base to update the rolls, but if any person who is not happy must object to the enrollment which is provided for under Section 48 of the Organic Law on National and Local Government Election,” he said.
He said the PNG Electoral Commission is committed to upholding the highest standards of electoral integrity and ensuring that elections are free, fair and credible.
“It also recognizes the importance of LLG elections to strengthen grassroots democracy and inclusive representation.
Mr Sinai said the Electoral Commission by law is required to prepare the Electoral Rolls six (6) months before the anniversary of the next election, may it be National General Election or Local Level Government election.
“Due to staff shortage, PNGEC gets support from LLG public servants and the provincial administrations to assist with the roll updates in the provinces.
“This is why the Electoral Commission is embarking on all of society approach to fixing the roll issue using a photo to the name.
“We are asking the National Government, provincial administrations, Local Level Governments, Wards and citizens to help identify the voters and prepare a biometric electoral roll for the good of the elections,” he said."
K56b spent on districts,27/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6598,,Government,Disgust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape recently highlighted that over K56 billion in public funds has been allocated across Papua New Guinea in the past six years.
During the launch of the Reset PNG@50 blueprint at the University of Papua New Guinea, he urged government agencies, provincial administrations, districts, and public institutions to deliver tangible outcomes from these investments.
Marape explained that this significant amount represents total funding distributed by his administration since 2019, covering a range of sectors including provincial and district governance, health authorities, and educational institutions such as universities and colleges.
“That is not a small sum. Every leader, administrator, and public servant must ask: what have we done with it?”
He said the amount represented the government’s commitment to decentralising service delivery and ensuring every level of government had access to resources.
“But I ask again — what has been achieved? Where are the results? The money is being released, but are we seeing improvement in schools, hospitals, and roads?” he said.
He revealed that recent administrative reviews had uncovered serious gaps in financial reporting and compliance, including agencies and authorities that failed to submit expenditure reports for several years.
He shared a recent example involving a senior official whose contract renewal he was forced to reject after discovering a five-year failure to provide expenditure reports.
“I had to cast a deciding vote against his reappointment,” he said.
The Prime Minister reiterated that the government will no longer tolerate poor financial management."
NMCA to probe government spending,27/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6603,,Government,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has announced the establishment of the National Monitoring and Coordination Authority as part of ongoing efforts to enhance value for money in government spending.
This initiative was unveiled during the launch of the Reset PNG@50 blueprint at the University of Papua New Guinea.
The new authority will be tasked with overseeing project implementation and monitoring expenditure, ensuring that public funds are utilized effectively and transparently.
In his address, Marape emphasized the importance of financial discipline and accountability, calling on provincial administrators, district development authorities, and departmental heads to adhere to these principles.
“This new authority will check where the money goes, what it delivers, and whether it benefits the people,” the prime minister said.
“Money must move from paper to the ground (an) if it doesn’t reach the people, then it has failed its purpo
se.”
Marape reminded leaders and officials that their positions are a privilege, not an entitlement.
“If a minister or superior asks you to do something against the law, stand for what is right,” he said.
“The country’s laws come first — not politics, not personalities,” he said."
PHA Sets Leadership Benchmark,26/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6593,,Health,Trust,Nill,"A smooth handover of leadership took place today at the West New Britain Provincial Health Authority (WNB PHA) as outgoing Chief Executive Officer Stanis Tao formally passed the baton to incoming Acting CEO Dr Joseph Nale.

PNG commits to global peace and development,26/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6591,,International,Trust,"James Marape, Soroi Eoe","The Papua New Guinea Government has committed to global peace and development on United Nations Day in Port Moresby.
Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, Soroi Eoe, speaking on behalf of Prime Minister James Marape, said PNG’s modern nationhood was deeply linked to the United Nations, from its early years under the UN Trusteeship system to its admission as the UN’s 143rd member on 16 September 1975.
“When our flag was raised, the United Nations did not merely recognise Papua New Guinea — it welcomed us home,” he said. “That moment affirmed our place within a family committed to peace, justice, and human dignity.”
He noted that Papua New Guinea’s cultural and linguistic diversity mirrored the UN’s global mission of unity through diversity. “Like the UN, we are a nation of hundreds of languages and cultures, yet united under one flag,” he said.
Minister Eoe outlined how, over the past five decades, Papua New Guinea had exercised principled leadership at the UN, especially on issues that directly affect its people.
“We speak for communities on the frontline of climate change,” he said. “We advocate for sustainable oceans, forest stewardship, and financing models that reward countries protecting the lungs and blue carbon sinks of the planet.”
He said these positions were rooted in the daily realities of Papua New Guineans — from the Highlands to the Sepik, and from the Bismarck to the Coral Sea.
Minister Eoe highlighted the strength of the partnership between Papua New Guinea and the UN across key areas such as climate-resilient infrastructure, clean energy, and job-creating agriculture.
“When droughts, landslides, and health emergencies struck, the UN stood with us — from vaccination campaigns to emergency relief and reconstruction. This is multilateralism in action: a hand extended when it matters most,” he said.
He also paid tribute to the UN’s role in peacebuilding efforts in Bougainville, acknowledging its contribution from ceasefire monitoring to post-referendum dialogue.
Minister Eoe said the recent visit of UN Secretary-General António Guterres — the first by a sitting UN chief — was a defining moment in PNG-UN relations.
“His visit reflected the UN’s confidence in our leadership in the Pacific,” he said. “He met Prime Minister Marape, addressed our National Parliament, and visited Wewak, Nuku, and Mt Hagen, witnessing the resilience and hope of our people.”
He noted that Prime Minister Marape’s address to the 80th Session of the UN General Assembly in New York underscored PNG’s leadership in global advocacy.
“Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed our commitment to the UN Charter and called for reforms to the global financial system to value forests, oceans, and climate resilience as global public goods,” Minister Eoe said. “Papua New Guinea will not be a bystander — we will be a solutions country.”
Minister Eoe said PNG supported reforms to make the UN “more representative and responsive” to today’s global challenges, including geopolitical tensions, food insecurity, and climate impacts.
He thanked the UN Country Team for its work with PNG’s government, churches, youth, and women’s groups, saying the partnership’s impact was “measured not in reports but in results — in the vaccinated child, the safe school, the functioning health post, and the peaceful community.”"
LDC Taps Local Expertise for Asset Valuation,26/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6590,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"The Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) is charting a bold investment path for Papua New Guinea’s livestock industry through a nationwide asset valuation project that is set to redefine how its public assets are leveraged for economic growth.
This pathway falls in line with LDC’s efforts to provide feedback to the government after a directive that came from the Prime Minister dated 17th March 2020, for a campaign involving reclamation and refurbishment to take stock of all government-owned assets under LDC.
On Thursday, October 23, 2025, during a signing ceremony, Chairman of the LDC Board, Martin Ginyaru, said the Government has spent substantial amounts on the reclamation program, and the onus is on the valuers to provide a report back for transparency and good governance.
LDC has engaged five reputable local asset valuation companies from a total of 11 applicants who responded to a public advertisement.
The internal procurement committee, chaired by LDC Finance Manager, Otto Wangillen, selected
Those companies are based on merit, given their wide experience and local knowledge of the real estate market across PNG.
The Valuers are tasked with conducting a comprehensive value assessment of LDC’s cattle ranches, abattoirs, and state–owned land under LDC across the country.
The decision to engage independent local valuers was made by the LDC Board of Directors to ensure this valuation process would not only restore operational clarity but also form the backbone of LDC’s investment forecast and development strategy.
“Valuation is not just a technical requirement; it is our launchpad for investment,” said Ginyaru.
He further added that engaging local valuators ensures that the process is not only technically sound but also grounded in local knowledge and accountability. This is a critical step in transforming underutilized assets into viable investment platforms,” he further added.
The valuers, drawn from across PNG, are tasked with conducting valuations on LDC’s extensive portfolio of properties and assets. Their work is central to the government’s asset valuation campaign, which aims to boost investor confidence, improve transparency, and lay the groundwork for public-private partnerships.
The asset valuation exercise will provide the transparency and credibility needed to structure investment-ready proposals. With clear asset records, LDC can now offer investors a portfolio of viable opportunities backed by verified data and government support.
Furthermore, the valuation initiative is part of PNG’s Medium-Term Development Plan IV 2023–2027, which targets self-sufficiency in meat production by 2030.
By quantifying the value and potential of its livestock infrastructure, LDC is positioning itself as a catalyst for agribusiness growth and rural development.
The valuation project is set to cost at least K500,000 in total and is expected to be concluded before the end of 2025."

Therefore, the Magisterial Services, in support of the National Judicial Staff Services, has engaged the Department of ICT and Blueeti, the contractor, to facilitate its solar power project, a solution aimed at increasing power connectivity to the court facility.
The project was launched on Friday, October 24th, at the court precinct.
The project aligns with the Magisterial Service ICT strategic plan 2026- 2030. Kwilila was chosen as a pilot site for the ICT update because of its accessibility and the issue of frequent power disruption. The Bluetti system is capable of generating 100 volts and is powered by portable solar technology.
Its main components include a generator, four highly efficient portable solar panels, and a power management system, which enables it to do switchovers.
District Court registrar Anna Aigilo said the district courts have 66 court locations in PNG, and because most of the courts are situated outside of a district, access to services is limited. Therefore, the launching of this pilot project will pave the way for the other district courts to access this service.
“Because we are out in the districts, we face geographical challenges to have access to basic services, and power or electricity is one of those challenges we face. For a court to operate, we must have a constant supply of electricity,” Aigilo said.
National Judicial Staff Services Secretary Nicodemus Mosoro commended the magisterial services for initiating this initiative, as it sets a precedent for other courts to have solar implementation in their court facilities.
Mosoro said, apart from the solar project, they aimed to integrate a new ICT system that would enable court users to use their phones and access court services.
“Our people can be able to file their matters on your smartphones wherever they are. Find out about their next court hearing date and others. This is our commitment to bring service to our people,” he said.
Mosoro said other plans in place are to establish a cell block, to remand perpetrators awaiting court, due to the inability of a cell block in Kwikila.
Meanwhile, Rigo Acting District Administrator Murry Konido pledged his support to the project, commanding the magisterial services to embrace clean energy to tackle ongoing power outages in the district."
Governor Parkop Commends Catholic Church’s Nation-Building Role,26/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6587,,Religion,Trust,Powes Parkop,"During the Thanksgiving Mass celebrating the canonization of Saint Peter ToRot and 50 years of the Catholic Church’s growth in Papua New Guinea, NCD Governor Powes Parkop delivered a heartfelt address acknowledging the Church’s enduring impact on the nation.
Governor Parkop thanked the Catholic Church leadership for organizing the national celebration and for its continued role in shaping the country’s moral, educational, and social foundations. He extended special appreciation to numerous businesses and partners for their contributions to the event and to national development.
He also commended the parish ministries, religious congregations, and Catholic faithful across the country for their commitment to community service and youth development.
“This is a great day for us to give thanks to God Almighty for our country and to celebrate the canonization of Saint Peter ToRot,” Governor Parkop said. “The Catholic Church has been a blessing to our people and our nation — shaping lives, nurturing children, and building a strong moral foundation for the future.”"
Church Marks 50 Years Blessed,26/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6586,,Religion,Joy,"Powes Parkop, Rufina Peter","The Catholic Church in Papua New Guinea has marked a historic milestone, celebrating 50 years of national independence alongside the canonisation of Saint Peter ToRot, the country’s first saint and martyr, during a Thanksgiving Mass at Sir Hubert Murray Stadium.
Delivering his address, Cardinal Sir John Ribat, Archbishop of Port Moresby, reflected on the Church’s journey from its missionary roots in 1844 to its present status as a pillar of faith, education, and health services.
With a membership of 2.5 million Catholics — one-quarter of PNG’s population, the Church stands as the second-largest health provider and maintains a vast network of schools and tertiary institutions across the country.
Cardinal Ribat described the Church’s transformation from a “missionary church to a local church,” emphasising its integral role in PNG’s growth as a nation.
“After 50 years as a nation, the Catholic Church has also grown,” he said.
“We are truly blessed and have many reasons to thank God Almighty for His many blessings.”
The Archbishop also paid tribute to the early missionaries whose efforts laid the foundation for the Church’s expansion such as Vunapope in East New Britain, Yule Island in Central, and Alexishafen in Madang; He acknowledged the sacrifices of priests and catechists who carried the Gospel through war, hardship, and isolation.
He said the canonisation of Saint Peter ToRot on October 18, 2025, following Pope Francis’ visit in 2024, symbolises global recognition of faith lived out in the everyday life of Papua New Guineans.
“Peter ToRot lived, worked, and died a catechist,” Cardinal Ribat said.
“The universal Church has recognized his courageous witness to faith. We are proud and grateful.”
Cardinal Ribat expressed gratitude to national and provincial leaders, sponsors, and lay members for their contributions to the Church’s mission. He thanked supporters including NCD Governor Powes Parkop, Central Governor Rufina Peter, Lae Biscuits, SVS Group of Companies, and others who helped make the thanksgiving event possible.
The Mass ended with the opening of the Church Expo, inviting the public to explore the many ministries and services provided by the Catholic Church across PNG, including health, education, and social development programs.
“The Church keeps the light of Christ burning in every corner of our nation,” Cardinal Ribat said.
“We continue to walk as pilgrims of hope, journeying from darkness to light.”"
Turning Buai Waste Green,25/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6580,,Business,Joy,Nill,"A Port Moresby agriculturalist has transformed one of Papua New Guinea’s biggest waste problems into an award-winning solution, turning discarded betelnut husks into an eco-friendly gardening product.
Geno Geno, founder of The Seed Supplier, has been crowned the overall winner of the 2025 Lily Homemade Microbusiness Competition for her innovative Areca Fibre Mulch — a sustainable mulch made from buai husks that reduces street litter while helping plants and trees retain moisture.
“Our process ensures that all bacteria and unwanted pathogens are removed,” Geno said. “We’re working with city managers to scale collection across every suburb — the goal is to cover the base of every garden bed and tree in Port Moresby.”
The initiative, born from a desire to clean up the city and promote greener practices, impressed judges for its environmental and social impact. Geno received K12,000 in prize money, sponsored by MiBank, the Australian Government through the PNGAus Partnership, and Women’s Micro Bank.
This is not Geno’s first win — she also claimed top honours in the inaugural 2022 Lily Homemade competition with her compostable betelnut palm leaf plates, bowls, and spoons. Since her latest win, she has introduced buai-skin bins to prevent spit contamination and showcased her product internationally at a climate adaptation summer school in Germany.
Second place went to Carole Cholai, an IT specialist and breast cancer survivor, for her one-sided post-mastectomy bra under her SistaLuv Foundation, a social enterprise that supports women through recovery and awareness programs in partnership with the Port Moresby General Hospital Cancer Unit.
Third place was awarded to Lae agronomist Nicholar Boas for her Warapipe Herbal Blue Salt, infused with butterfly pea flowers to help combat lifestyle diseases. Boas has since launched her Blue Bloome brand and is seeking investment to expand production.
This year’s competition attracted 150 entries nationwide, with 15 finalists attending a four-day business workshop at the Women’s Business Resource Centre, supported by the Australian Government through the PNGAus Partnership. Participants received mentoring from MiBank, Mama Bank, CPL Group, and media partners.
The program continues to empower Papua New Guinea’s emerging entrepreneurs, transforming creative homemade ideas into sustainable enterprises — from organic hair dye makers to dairy-free dessert producers.
A full wrap-up of the competition, including a shopping guide of the top 50 products, is featured in Lily Magazine Issue #28, released this week."

Faith-based organization highlights lack of rehabilitation programs at prisons,25/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6582,,Society,Sadness,Nill,"Correctional Services are mandated to correct, rehabilitate, and reintegrate inmates for a smooth transition back into communities after serving prison terms. But insiders say most prisons lack functioning programs with no trained counselors, vocational training, transitional housing, legal aid, or follow-up support. For many inmates, release simply means returning to society with no skills, no support, and no second chance.
This was revealed by a faith-based organisation during the ABCID PNG- MDI conference held on 24th October at Lamana Hotel Port Moresby. Themed ""Safe Spaces, Strong Voices,” the conference was aimed at fostering networking, collaboration and media awareness and civil society organisations working to address violence, integration, and community healing.
Hope Behind Bars (HBB) Program, a faith-based initiative run by Pastor Simon Kuman and his family tries to fill this gap through their program. Broadcasted every Thursday and Saturday from 9–11 a.m. on Wantok Radio Light, the program shares testimonies from former inmates who’ve rebuilt their lives. It’s not government-funded — it’s powered by faith, family, and a microphone.
“We’ve rehabilitated nearly 500 inmates,"" Ps Kuman says. “Four of them now co-host the show, warning youth about violence and crime.”
The team records stories inside correctional facilities, counsels released inmates, and visits schools to raise awareness. “We’ve seen men walk out after 23 years with hope, not hatred,” Ps Kuman says. “Lives are being rebuilt — not by policy, but by community love.”
He calls  for more partners: legal experts, counselors, churches, and media allies to help amplify the message. “Everyone deserves a second chance,” he says. “Hope is not a policy. It’s a promise.”"
Following the money trail,24/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6576,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"Following yesterday’s sentencing of the former Deputy Secretary of Finance, Jacob Yafai to 22 years in prison, police minister Peter Tsiamalili Jnr said it is time to follow the money trail. Minister Tsiamalili said Yafai’s conviction is the beginning of a full-scale financial recovery operation. The Asset Restraint and Recovery Working (ARROW) Group has been directed to pursue all assets linked to the K41.8 million kina.
Tsiamalili said the court’s conviction has now provided the legal foundation and momentum for police to begin tracing the stolen K41.8 million, marking the start of a broader money-trail investigation that will extend as far back as necessary — even over the past decade.
“Now that the courts have established guilt, the RPNGC has a clear legal mandate to follow the money trail — wherever it leads and however far back it goes. No one who participated in these crimes will escape accountability,” he said. “The conviction gives us the authority to act decisively.”
The minister confirmed that Police Commissioner David Manning has directed the ARROW Group to immediately pursue all assets linked to the stolen funds, including those transferred, hidden, or laundered through associates.
“ARROW is now tracing all transactions, properties, and offshore holdings connected to these funds,” Tsiamalili said. “There is no way K41.8 million of public money will simply disappear.”
“When criminals steal from the State, they steal from the sick in our hospitals, from the children in our schools, and from our police who serve the people.
“The conviction of Yafai gives confidence that the system works — and it empowers us to recover what was stolen, not just from this case but from years of unchecked corruption,” he said.
The ARROW Group includes financial and legal experts from the Bank of Papua New Guinea’s Financial Analysis and Supervision Unit (FASU), the RPNGC National Fraud and Anti-Corruption Directorate (NFACD), and the Office of the Public Prosecutor (OPP).
“This is just the start,” the minister said. “The conviction has opened the door - now the police will walk through it and bring back what belongs to our people.”"
Renewed national commitment to children required,24/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6577,,Politics,Anticipation,Powes Parkop,"The special Parliamentary Committee on Children and Youth Well-being has launched a Bold National Review to Secure the Future of PNG’s Children, during the Committee’s inaugural session at the Parliament State Function Room on the 14th and 15th of October 2025.
The special Parliamentary Committee on Children and Youth Well-being marked a historic moment, setting the foundation for stronger parliamentary oversight, accountability, and action to improve the lives of children and youth across the country.
“Now is the time for all of us to think about our children,” declared Governor Powes Parkop, Chair of the Special Parliamentary Committee on Children and Youth Well-being, as he opened the Committee’s first-ever inquiry session in Parliament held on 14-15 October, 2025.
Over two days, the inquiry brought together Members of Parliament, Provincial Governors, key government departments, and development partners including UNICEF. It examined challenges and progress in health, education, nutrition, child protection, WASH, and provincial governance, signaling a new era of results-focused collaboration.
Children’s Health and Nutrition: “From the Womb to the Tomb”
Health was at the center of the Committee’s deliberations. Acting Health Secretary, Ken Wai emphasized the Department’s life-cycle responsibility, “looking after a human being from the womb to the tomb.”
Despite gains in life expectancy, the Committee noted that national immunization coverage remains critically low at 47%, with provinces such as Madang at only 22%. The Committee pressed for stronger coordination between the National Department of Health (NDoH) and Provincial Health Authorities (PHAs) to close gaps and improve accountability.
Governor Parkop called for urgency saying, “We cannot continue to normalize poor child health outcomes or accept malnutrition as routine. Poor nutrition is robbing our children of their potential and our nation of its future.”
In response the NDoH committed to finalizing amendments to the PHA Act to strengthen provincial oversight and to fast-track approval of the Village Health Assistant (VHA) Policy by 2026. The Department also pledged to roll out a National Nutrition Survey in 2026 and to use the National Nutrition Summit for greater cross-sectoral coordination.
Education and Early Childhood Development: Building Foundations for the Future.
The Committee reviewed evidence showing that while over 80% of children enter primary school, only 5–10% reach university or college.
Governor Parkop urged a fundamental rethink: “Education is the great equalizer but only if every child is able to stay in school, learn, and thrive.”
Meanwhile, the Department of Education presented progress on the Early Childhood Education (ECE) Policy, which plans for two years of pre-primary learning (K1–K2) alongside the education 1-6-6 reform. However, challenges remain include ECE teachers not yet on payroll and limited provincial funding for early learning centers.
The Committee recommended that ECE teacher salaries be integrated into the 2026 national budget, and that the Department finalize the national ECE expansion plan, including teacher registration, curriculum rollout, and improved WASH facilities in schools.
Child Protection: Strengthening Accountability and Action
The Committee raised deep concern over the slow implementation of the Lukautim Pikinini Act (2015) and the limited operational capacity of the National Office of Child and Family Services (NOCFS). Only 60 of 130 approved positions are currently filled, and the National Child and Family Services Council has been inactive since 2023. Governor Parkop stressed that child protection cannot remain as an afterthought:
“Every day a child faces abuse, neglect, or violence, we fail in our duty. Protection must be at the heart of government responsibility.” Parkop said.
NOCFS committed to expanding the number of child protection officers to 180 by 2025, reactivating the National Child and Family Services Council by early 2026, and rolling out Provincial Child and Family Services Councils across all provinces.
The Committee directed DfCDR and NOCFS to submit a reform and staffing plan by end-2025 and to clarify institutional oversight to ensure greater accountability."
Promoting Peace Through storytelling,24/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6578,,Development,Trust,Nill,"A new, Australian-funded initiative is harnessing the power of storytelling to promote peace, empathy, and non-violence among Papua New Guineans of all ages.

TKCP Wins Darwin Grant,24/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6568,,Environment,Trust,Nill,"The Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program (TKCP) has been awarded a prestigious grant from the UK Government under its Darwin Initiative Awards, marking a major boost for wildlife conservation and community development in Papua New Guinea.
The grant will support TKCP’s ongoing efforts to protect the endangered Matschie’s tree kangaroo and preserve biodiversity across the 162,000-hectare YUS Conservation Area, while assisting more than 50 remote villages in the Huon Peninsula.
“Over the next two years, this project will equip the YUS Conservation Area’s Ward and Local Level Governments with the knowledge and skills to create their respective Development Plans through a consultative process informed by a diverse range of community leaders,” said TKCP Executive Director Modi Pontio.
The initiative will strengthen the capacity of customary landowner groups, government bodies, and non-governmental stakeholders, providing sustained training, mentorship, and guidance for Ward Councilors, Ward Development Committees, Local Level Governments, and Community-Based Organizations. “By targeting the capacity of customary landowners, leaders, and their local elected representatives, this project will enhance the protected area’s management effectiveness via increased government contribution and accountability,” Ms Pontio added.
Spanning four Local Level Governments and 18 Wards across Morobe and Madang, the YUS landscape benefits from TKCP’s holistic approach to conservation, which includes natural resource management, sustainable livelihoods, education, one health, and solar-powered lighting.
British High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Anne Macro, expressed support for the initiative: “The Darwin Initiative grants assist low and middle-income countries to conserve their unique biodiversity, reduce poverty and address climate change. Since 2022, Darwin Initiative projects have enabled countries to manage 591,000 hectares of habitat more sustainably, and 130,000 people to improve their resilience to natural disasters and climate change.”
Founded in 1996, TKCP began as an international wildlife conservation program by the Woodland Park Zoological Society to protect the Matschie’s tree kangaroo and its cloud forest habitat.
Today, it is a leading organization promoting community-based wildlife and habitat conservation using a holistic one-health approach that benefits both people and the environment."

LLG presidents for these provinces will be elected by the councilors at the LLG chambers.
For the other 14 provinces, two ballot papers will be issued to voters – one for the ward member and one for the LLG president where voters will directly vote for the president.
Mr Sinai thanked all provincial administrators and their Provincial Election Advisory Committees for working together with their provincial electoral staff to deliver this constitutionally sanction event."
Students Innovate Cleaner Mining Solution,23/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6558,,Education,Anticipation,Nill,"Students from St. Charles Lwanga Secondary School in Port Moresby demonstrated their scientific creativity at the 2025 Climate Science Fair hosted by the Port Moresby Nature Park. They presented an innovative model to reduce environmental harm caused by mining tailings.
Grade 11 student, Pentason Tagupa, speaking on behalf of his team, explained that their project — titled “Filtration and Air Separation in Mining Processes” — focuses on developing a system to minimize chemical and gas emissions from tailings storage facilities (TSFs).
Tagupa described how the filtration process begins after ore extraction, where the slurry of ground rock, water, and chemicals — known as tailings — is filtered. “The residue, sand, and other impure substances remain while the water containing chemicals is pumped out by a DC motor into the dam,” he said.
Once filtered, gases released from the process are passed through an air separation chamber cooled to cryogenic temperatures below -100°C, condensing the air and separating gases based on their boiling points. These gases are then stored in cylinders for safe transport to laboratories, cosmetic industries, and food processing facilities.
The filtered water is further purified through distillation, which uses heat to evaporate and condense clean water into storage tanks, leaving chemical residues behind. Tagupa explained that this step ensures that the recycled water can be safely reused for other industrial or environmental purposes.
The project also explored how poor management of tailings facilities can cause serious ecological damage. Tailings that leak or burst under pressure can destroy forests, contaminate rivers, and harm marine life. The students emphasised that gases such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide  released from tailings contribute directly to global warming.
Their model highlights the role of natural carbon sinks — forests, oceans, and soils — in absorbing excess carbon and mitigating climate change. The team’s goal is to promote responsible mining practices and raise awareness about how scientific innovation can reduce the industry’s environmental footprint.
The Climate Science Fair, organized by the Port Moresby Nature Park under its “Love Your Nature Park, Protect Our Biodiversity” initiative, showcased dozens of student projects focused on renewable energy, waste management, and sustainable technologies.
The fair aims to nurture young scientists who can lead future environmental solutions for Papua New Guinea."

The newly installed solar systems are supplying vital energy to over 9,000 households, 76 community facilities, and powering 151 streetlights, lighting homes, streets, and public spaces for the thousands of people who previously lacked reliable access.
New Ireland Governor Walter Schnaubelt recently joined representatives from Australia and the UK to congratulate Namatanai District Authority on the project’s success, as a long-term benefit.
“These solar lights will provide a safe learning environment for our students, and communities’ livelihoods will improve,” Governor Schnaubelt said.
A crucial component of the project's long-term sustainability is the strong emphasis on local training and ownership.
A total of 592 local solar champions (296 women and 296 men) were trained through the initiative to provide ongoing maintenance for the new systems.
These champions are supported by a dedicated Solar Hub in Silom village, which provides technical guidance and spare parts, ensuring communities have reliable energy for years to come.
Australian High Commission Minister Counsellor, Dr Cate Rogers, commended the collaborative approach, stating, “The project owes its success to the communities themselves – their support and participation were vital.”
The Pawa Bilong Niu Ailan project was implemented by Australia and the United Kingdom with support from local authorities, aligning with broader regional development goals.
Australia remains committed to working alongside Papua New Guinea to achieve its ambitious national electrification targets: connecting 70 per cent of the population by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2040."

The city residents also participated in the program to further amplify the Global Call to Action on Breast Cancer and other forms of Cancer.
NCDPHA Chief Executive Officer Dr. Robin Oge said cancer remains a “silent killer” in Papua New Guinea and around the world, and that prevention must begin at the community level.
He said NCD PHA aims to ensure both men and women enjoy a cancer-free life through early detection and information sharing.
The common types of women’s cancer in PNG; Breast Cancer, Cervical Cancer, Lip & Oral Cavity Cancer & Liver Cancer. Other common cancers that affect men are: Prostate Cancer, Lip & Oral Cavity Cancer Liver Cancer.
Dr. Oge also emphasized the importance of public health promotion and community responsibility, urging people to make healthier lifestyle choices and seek early screening. “Information and prevention are our strongest tools. Everyone has a role to play in saving lives,” he said.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop, who also participated and supported the Walk, said, “It is a shared responsibility where the Awareness & Education campaign on cancer lies with the organisations, communities, and individuals to promote early detection, prevention, and education about common cancers in PNG.”
This joint effort also indicates the commitment of NCD PHA to promote a cancer-free future for Papua New Guinea.
Dr. Robin Oge has called on both the male and female populations in the National Capital District and throughout Papua New Guinea to seek immediate medical attention if they experience abnormal cancer signs.
“Early detection and treatment of Cancer is very important to prolong life,” said Dr. Oge."
MRDC confirms royalty transfer for its beneficiaries,22/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6551,,Business,Trust,Nill,"The Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC) confirms that the Central Bank of Papua New Guinea has released accrued royalty payments for PNG LNG Project area landowners into their Trusts, which it manages.
MRDC is mandated under the Oil & Gas Act to manage benefits for project area landowners in petroleum projects in the country.
Under the benefits sharing arrangements reached at the UBBSA in Kokopo, before commencement of the PNG LNG Project, the royalty benefits are paid to the Government (into a trust account held at BPNG), which then releases them to its main beneficiaries: the landowners (70%), and the Hela, Southern Highlands, Gulf, Western and Central provincial governments and impacted local Level Governments (30%).
In accordance with the Oil & Gas Act, and benefits-sharing agreement reached in 2009, royalty and equity benefits for landowners are to be split in the 40:30:30 formula, where 40 per cent is paid as a cash benefit to benefitting clans, 30 per cent is invested in the Future Generation Fund (Investment), and 30 per cent in Community Infrastructure Trust Fund (social development projects).
MRDC Managing Director and CEO Augustine Mano welcomed the release of the royalty benefits.
“The release of the royalty payments is great news for landowners. The early release of these benefits to a number of these groups have been delayed by clan disputes and court cases.
“For Hides PDL1 landowners, this is timely. MRDC will proceed to complete the clan bank account opening and director elections exercise so payment can be made before the end of the year.
“This exercise commenced in April 2024 but was suspended due to a restraining order from the court obtained by a party. This case has now been resolved, and the restraining order lifted, clearing the way for us to resume.”
For Hides PDL7 landowners, royalty benefits for 2014 – 2021, and equity benefits for 2014 – 2017 have been paid. Their royalty (2022 – current) and equity (2018 – current) benefits will now be paid with the release of their royalty entitlement.
This also includes the Pipeline and the Plant Site landowners.
Royalty and equity benefits for PDL 2 (Kutubu) and PDL 3 & 4 (Gobe) will be withheld pending the resolution of a number of disputes that are currently in place.
With the opening of the new MRDC Office in Tari, Hela Province, last week, Mr Mano said that all royalty and equity benefits processing for Hela landowners will now be handled in Tari, not in Port Moresby.
“I want to encourage all landowners and their clan leaders who are in Port Moresby to return home. We have an office in Tari. Cooperate and work with us on the ground in Tari for the benefit of everyone.”
The Account Opening and Directors Elections Process for the Angore (PDL8) landowners will commence as soon as the PDL1 exercise is completed, while a Ministerial.
Meantime, determination is pending for the landowners of Juha (PDL8)."
DLPP completes capacity audit program in WNB,22/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6549,,Government,Trust,Nill,"The Department of Lands and Physical Planning (DLPP) concluded the Capacity Audit Program in West New Britain Province. This will now prepare the province to handle its land administration.
The delegation led by DLPP Secretary Benjamin Samson comprised directors and managers representing key technical divisions within the department.
These divisions include the Customary Lands ILG, Customary Land Registrations, Customary Land Development, State Land, Office of the Chief Physical Planner, Office of the Surveyor General, Office of the Valuer General, including Human Resources and the Policy and Legal Services.
The team visited the West New Britain Provincial Lands Office, including Nakanai and Talasea Districts, as part of a comprehensive assessment.
The visit was to physically assess whether the WNB Provincial Lands Division has the institutional capacity, technical expertise, and infrastructure to perform both state land and customary land functions in the province.
The Capacity Audit will also determine if the Provincial Administration is ready to take on key functions of the Land Board and the Physical Planning Board.
During the visit, the DLPP team engaged directly with the Provincial Administrators, as well as District Administrators, Provincial Planners, Surveyors, and Lands Officers to gather data and identify areas in need of institutional support and technical capacity building.
A formal report, including a proposed structure for the Provincial Lands Division, was presented to the West New Britain Provincial Administration for review and potential integration into its Provincial Administration Structure.
“We need to establish whether provinces have the capacity to host their own Land Boards and Physical Planning Boards. This is essential to ensure land matters are managed locally, rather than relying on the National Lands Department.
""When provincial services are unavailable, people turn to national boards. These functions must be decentralized to address land and development issues within each province,” Secretary Benjamin Samson said.
The West New Britain Provincial Government welcomed the findings of the Capacity Audit and expressed its commitment to strengthening institutional capacity for land governance.
The Capacity Audit findings and recommendations will inform future planning, resource allocation, and staff development to ensure provinces can independently manage both state and customary land matters."
PNG forest activists protest over Malaysian logging companies,22/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6548,,Environment,Anger,Nill,"Representatives of Papua New Guinea’s civil society, alongside partners RimbaWatch and Bruno Manser Fonds, have voiced serious concerns regarding the deforestation of PNG's forests by major Malaysian companies.
On Tuesday, the group organized a protest in Kuala Lumpur, targeting the actions of Malaysian logging firms operating in Papua New Guinea.
This demonstration coincided with the release of a new report titled “Malaysia's Timber Colony: Exposing Malaysia’s Grip Over Papua New Guinea’s Forests.”
The report sheds light on Forest Clearing Authorities (FCAs), a licensing system that facilitates large-scale forest conversion and has been identified as a significant driver of deforestation in the country.
The coalition is urging heightened awareness and action to protect PNG’s vital forest ecosystems from unsustainable exploitation. The report states FCAs are issued by the government on the grounds of agricultural development.
However, they are often linked to the clear-cutting and subsequent conversion of highly biodiverse forests, with the timber being exported to China and few economic benefits generated within the country itself.
The report finds that 97 per cent (65 of 67) FCA licences are held by companies either registered in Malaysia, or in which Malaysian citizens are either the majority shareholders and/or directors.
These Malaysian-linked companies hold licenses that threaten at least 1.68 million hectares of primary rainforest in Papua New Guinea.
Primarily, of the 79 Malaysians who are linked to these companies, the report finds that 44 individuals might be associated with the “big six” Sarawakian logging firms (named). It states that together, these individuals alone control 60 per cent of the FCA licenses.
Since the 1990s, there has been an influx of Malaysian companies in the timber industry in PNG.
Forming part of the world’s third-largest intact tropical forest, 15 per cent of the country’s forest area has been degraded in recent years, and in 2013, PNG overtook Malaysia as the largest exporter of tropical timber in the world.
While the involvement of Malaysian companies in the timber industry is well-known within PNG, this is the first time a report systematically documents the extent of Malaysia’s timber dynasties in the country.
The Report says that beyond the significant impacts FCA licenses have on biodiversity loss in PNG, such projects almost exclusively occur on Indigenous customary land, and FCAs have been found to involve serious human rights abuses, including land-grabbing, violations of the right to Free, Prior, Informed Consent (FPIC) and physical violence.
In one case, a member of an Indigenous community was locked in a shipping container for one week.
Pamela Avusi, Coordinator of the PNG Environmental alliance, said: “FCAs are an extremely unsustainable logging practice and are often associated with violations of indigenous peoples' rights. We call on the Malaysian timber tycoons behind 97 per cent of these licenses to relinquish them. Papua New Guinea is destroying its forests and is fully aware of this.”
“For this reason, the government has once again announced a moratorium on tropical timber exports at the end of this year. It is time to stop deforestation now. Please stop cutting down our forests,” said Avusi.
The group also demanded that the Government of PNG fix the FCA licensing system, which includes a moratorium on all logging within FCAs until a review. The PNGEA and partners call on Malaysia to build the capacity of Malaysia’s National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights to govern the activities of Malaysia’s businesses abroad.
This could include establishing a Human Rights Tribunal and a Supply Chain Act, which would include provisions to compel Malaysian companies to adhere to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in their overseas activities.
“Papua New Guinea’s rainforests, part of the world’s third-largest tropical rainforest ecosystem, are increasingly at risk. The main threat is non-sustainable logging and forest clearing,” the report stated.
With an export volume of 2.5 million m3 in 2024, Papua New Guinea is the world’s largest exporter of tropical roundwood."
Inclusive Economic Growth and Gender Equality.,22/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6554,,Business,Trust,Nill,"Chief Secretary to the Government Ivan Pomaleu launched the PNG Gender Inclusive Private Sector (GIPS) Assessment, declaring it a national blueprint for inclusive economic growth and gender equality.
Speaking at the event, Pomaleu emphasised that the assessment—developed in partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI)—is not just a report but a strategic tool to translate policy into action under the Medium-Term Development Strategy IV (MTDS 2023–2027).
“Let us work together to improve childcare access, promote fair work conditions, and expand access to finance to enable women-led businesses to thrive,” Pomaleu said.
He stressed that removing structural barriers such as limited childcare, unequal access to credit, and workplace discrimination is essential to unlocking the full potential of all Papua New Guineans, especially women and persons with disabilities.
Pomaleu called for stronger partnerships between government, business, and development partners to deliver on MTDS goals, noting that inclusive policies can boost national productivity and contribute up to 30 per cent GDP growth across the Pacific region over the next decade.
“By acting on the insights of this assessment, we advance our national development agenda while upholding our commitments to equality, opportunity, and shared prosperity,” he concluded."

This plan outlines the organization’s goals and initiatives aimed at enhancing national security and intelligence capabilities over the next several years.
Acting Director General, Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Dorpar, revealed that this is the first corporate plan launched.
The PNGNIO Corporate Plan 2025 – 2030 aims to address emerging challenges and improve operational efficiency while fostering collaboration with other governmental and non-governmental entities.
Lt Col. Dorpar said the national security threat environment is more sophisticated now than it was decades ago, hence the need for the PNG NIO to strengthen its intelligence capacity and capabilities.

TSC says no negotiation for PNGTA,22/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6540,,Education,Anger,Nill,"The Teaching Service Commission (TSC) cannot go into negotiations with PNG Teachers Association because of several reasons, says TSC Chairman Samson Wangihomie.
He was responding to a letter signed by the PNTGA General Secretary on October 6, giving a seven-day notice to the TSC to respond to a PNGTA Teachers’ Salary Fixation Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) for 2026 – 2028 from the date of notice.
The letter stated that after seven days the PNGTA would seek legal advice on the matter.
In response, Wangihomie said the Teachers Salary Fixation MoA cannot be renewed firstly because the position of the president and the National Management Committee (NMC) has expired therefore; TSC cannot go into negotiations with PNGTA.
“Even if we go for negotiations, it will still be unsuccessful because other parties involved, know that the term of the PNGTA executives has expired so they will not honor the negotiations,” he said.
The 2023 to 2025 MoA was to be reviewed in April as per the MoA. However, PNGTA came in very late to review it as they did in 2024 for the 2023 to 2025 MOA.
Wangihomie also questioned why PNGTA general secretary was the signatory of the letter that was sent to TSC.
“Why is PNGTA general secretary writing to the chairman of the teaching service, when he is not even the president of the union but is an employee of PNGTA? The General Secretary has no authority. The letter that they wrote has no effect because the acting General Secretary is an employee of the union,” he said.
Wangihomie said also that PNGTA does not have a log of claims that should justify and qualify what they have for the negotiation.
He said, most importantly the budget cycle for 2026 has passed. For the 2023 to 2025 MOA to be reviewed, it is therefore late, to be considered for 2026 Money Plan (Budget)."

KPHL board welcome courts decision,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6522,,Business,Trust,James Marape,"The Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) Board have welcomed the decision of the National Court in relation to the cases that was submitted earlier in the month by suspended KPHL managing director, Wapu Sonk.
The National Court on Monday, October 20, dismissed review application. The decision was made by Justice Susan Purdon-Sully, dismissing Sonk’s application for a judicial review for being an abuse of process.
The National Court decision confirms the legal standing of the KPHL Board led by Chairman Gerea Aopi, appointed by Prime Minister James Marape as sole trustee on behalf of the State; the Board's suspension of Sonk and its appointment of Luke Liria as Acting Managing Director.
The court judgement related to a request for a judicial review of the instrument appointing a chairman and directors of KPHL, made by Prime Minister James Marape as the Trustee of the company, on June 10, 2025, and subsequent court actions since that time. The ruling noted, ""the application for leave for judicial review is dismissed as an abuse of court process.""
Chairman Aopi said, ""The Board is pleased with the ruling, and the judgement's comprehensive analysis and consideration of all the actions taken by various interested parties over the last few months, after the issue of the appointment instrument. This demonstrates the integrity of our civil democratic processes.""
""The Board of KPHL is now free to pursue its role in overseeing the activities of this important industry entity, and in doing so we will hopefully restore public trust in its operations and pursuance of its vision to create value and opportunity from the nation's petroleum resources for Papua New Guinea and its people.""
""Whatever public perceptions or opinion may be, the KPHL Board has always abided by the rule of law, a practice we intend to continue in the coming years of our tenure; to always act in the best interests of KPHL,” said Aopi.
He stated that going forward, the Board intends to follow normal good governance practice and ensure accountability for all KPHL's actions and activities, including any changes that may be necessary in company management.
“This is particularly important at this present time in the lead up to the long-awaited announcement of the Final Investment Decision for the Papua LNG Project by Total Energies,"" Aopi added."
"Grey listing unavoidable, says Barker",21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6527,,Business,Fear,Nill,"The Institute of National Affairs Executive Director, Paul Barker and a noted economic analyst, has indicated that Papua New Guinea is likely to face grey listing next February, a situation he describes as unavoidable.
Mr Barker told this newsroom that despite this challenging outlook, Barker stressed the importance of focusing on mitigating the impact by striving to limit the duration of the grey listing.
“At this stage it really looks virtually impossible to avoid grey listing next February.
“The challenging, rather, will be to seek to limit the duration of grey-listing to as short a period as possible,” said Barker.
He suggested that proactive measures and reforms could potentially help reduce the time spent in this status, thereby minimizing its negative implications for the nation’s economy and international reputation.
Barker clarified that the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) committee based in the Gulf determines grey listing for countries, based upon a set of criteria.
“The rules, which are designed to protect the soundness of the global financial system, includes requirements for monitoring and compliance, which includes prosecution where offences are occurring to ensure deterrence.
“PNG has introduced extensive relevant legislation against money laundering, proceeds of crime, whistle-blower, unexplained wealth, and anti-corruption laws, with new bodies including FASU and ICAC.”
“It has strengthened its monitoring and oversight capacity, working closely with banks, which have reinforced AML capacity. The cooperation and coordination capacity between responsible authorities has also been stepped up.”
However, he said to date, there have been no prosecutions where offences have occurred, and extensive offences or suspected offences have been identified, so there have been no penalties or deterrence effect, as the police fraud squad has had little capacity (or inclination) to prosecute cases referred to it by FASU, and ICAc has not been functioning long enough to handle cases, although it has started.
He explained that the FATF requires at least two years of evidenced prosecutions which is not happening.
“So, the issue is building up a track record of oversight and governance, and show that to be the case consistently.
“Other potential money laundering devices, using a new casino and alluvial gold, will also require better oversight.”"
Building Workforce Capability in Chimbu,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6529,,Government,Trust,Nill,"The Department of Personal Management (DPM) is taking major steps to strengthen public service delivery in the Highlands. DPM conducted a one-day workshop in Chimbu Province on Friday, October 17, to introduce the Capability Needs Analysis (CAN) program.
Led by Executive Manager for Strategic Policy Development, Idia Yuki, and her team from Port Moresby, the workshop brought together the Simbu Provincial Administration, the Simbu Provincial Health Authority (PHA), and local human resource officers to begin implementing the new system aimed at improving workforce capability and performance.
Mrs. Yuki explained that the program is designed to provide a structured approach to assessing staff competencies, identifying training gaps, and guiding investment in skill development.
“Our visitation here is to pioneer Simbu Provincial Administration and Simbu PHA to start implementing and utilizing this system — assessing needs and analysis to develop their training plan.”
She said the impact of the program is significant, as it introduces a more systematic and constructive way of identifying skill and competency gaps within provincial organisations.
“This is basically a system we would like to introduce throughout the public service, and by starting with Simbu PHA and PA, we hope to set the foundation for independent and objective training assessments,” added Mrs Yuki.
Simbu Provincial Administration’s principal advisor for Human Resources, Alois Siune, commended the DPM team for introducing the program, calling it a timely and much-needed initiative.
“This is the first of its kind being done here. We’ve had training before, but not as active due to certain constraints. Now that DPM has come on board with AusAID to run this program, it will help us identify real training needs and conduct the right programs accordingly.”
The session concluded with participants committing to implement the CAN program across all provincial departments, ensuring Simbu’s public servants are better equipped to deliver effective and quality services to their communities."
Rocket stoves to improve rural standards,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6534,,Technology,Joy,Nill,"A demonstration at the Siar village yesterday afternoon had villagers, especially mothers, in awe as the “Rocket Cooker” was introduced.
Created under the company Rocket Boil ‘N’ Cook by Paul McFarlane, an engineer by profession, this cooker was inspired from living at the Asuramba Manam Care Centre in Bogia in 2011.
Mr McFarlane is married to a Manam lady and saw first hand the reality struggles faced by the Manam Islanders in the Card Centres.
Firewood was a challenge often resulting in quarrels and fighting and as Papua New Guineans love their hot beverages such as tea and coffee, the need for constant heat and water got him thinking.
Using his professional knowledge, he capitalized in making a prototype of this genius invention which is not only efficient and convenient, it is portable, durable and does the work of two things at one time; cook food and boil water.
All these years after 2011, Paul and his wife put their time effort and money into making this innovation. This year, after the project was finalised, it was given to an international manufacturer. They left Auckland and traveled with their sample for demonstration in hopes of getting a local supplier on board to market it.
They managed to travel to Mt. Hagen, Lae and now in Madang to showcase their input into developing and making village life a bit easier.
The Rocket stove has an inbuilt 15L compartment for water which is the cylindrical part with a spout. The hollow in the Middle bit for the fire which lets cooking take place above, which has gap at the bottom for twigs to make fire.
One of the Siar mothers was so impressed with this stove that she cannot wait to have it on the shelves to get herself one. Francisca Palangat stayed that she could see this assist mothers including herself make cooking easier and on the other hand, it could also benefit them financially with little cooking market, as it is portable.
Whilst Mr. McFarlane and his wife are yet to establish a market in Papua New Guinea, they state that their product is already selling in New Zealand as people are finding it convenient to their needs.
Their main aim is to assist disadvantaged rural communities, however, they found that it is applicable to urban needs as well for camping/hunting trips, island cooking, disaster relief and in most instances in PNG, blackout situations."
Gov’t will continue to pursue environmental policies: Marape,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6530,,Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,"The Government will continue to pursue policies that strengthen forest conservation, sustainable land use, renewable energy development, and climate resilience in rural communities.
Prime Minister James Marape made these remarks when meeting with relevant agencies on climate change to debrief before attending the COP30 meeting in Brazil in November.
“Our approach is to balance conservation with sustainable development,” he said.
“We want to protect our forests while empowering our people through sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, and responsible resource management. Climate finance and carbon credit systems must directly benefit our local communities who are the true custodians of our forests.”
The Prime Minister further emphasized that PNG’s participation at COP30 will go beyond the Conference itself, with plans already underway for post-COP30 implementation and alignment of national frameworks to attract more green investments and partnerships, as well as establishing relevant policy and legal frameworks to enable a stronger future for PNG in terms of rainforest or biodiversity.
“Our work does not end in Brazil,” PM Marape said.
“When our delegation returns, we will continue aligning our national policies to ensure that climate programs deliver real, measurable benefits for our people and our economy.”
Prime Minister Marape concluded by reaffirming that PNG will go to COP30 as a voice for rainforest nations and small island states, carrying a message of climate justice, shared responsibility, and global partnership."
PM meets with agencies of climate change,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6537,,Politics,Anticipation,"Gary Juffa, James Marape","Prime Minister James Marape recently held an important briefing with key Government agencies as Papua New Guinea prepares for the upcoming COP30 United Nations Climate Change Conference.
The Leaders session will be held from November 6–7, 2025, in Brazil — another major rainforest nation and partner in global climate advocacy.
The preparatory meeting, held at the Office of the Prime Minister, brought together Climate Change and Development Authority (CCDA) Acting Managing Director, Debra Sungi, the Conservation and Environment Protection Authority (CEPA) Managing Director, Jude Tukuliya, Provincial Member for Oro, Gary Juffa, and senior officials from CEPA, CCDA, and the Office of the Prime Minister.
Prime Minister Marape is scheduled to speak at the Leaders’ Session of COP30 on November 6. He will deliver PNG’s Country Statement — focusing on the protection of rainforest ecosystems, the value of biodiversity, carbon trading frameworks, and fair access to the Global Climate Fund for developing and climate-vulnerable nations.
“Papua New Guinea stands as one of the few remaining large rainforest nations in the world,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Our forests absorb carbon for the global good, yet our people receive very little compensation or recognition for the vital climate services we provide. At COP30, I will again remind the world that nations like ours deserve fair treatment and real climate financing — not just promises.”
PNG’s position remains firm — that developed and industrial nations responsible for the majority of global emissions must do more to honour their commitments to climate finance and technology transfer.
The Prime Minister noted that he intentionally did not attend COP29 in 2024 in Baku, Azerbaijan, in protest of the lack of meaningful progress from larger nations despite years of promises.
“I did not attend COP29 last year because too often, these global meetings have been long on talk and short on action,” PM Marape said.
“However, we are beginning to see encouraging signs that our collective call from the Pacific and other rainforest nations is being heard. COP30 in Brazil will be a defining moment — a chance to turn promises into practical outcomes.”"
Novel “Forgotten Land” Reveals Rabaul’s Past,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6535,,History,Sadness,Nill,"Lae-based author Marisa Jones has launched her latest historical novel, A Forgotten Land, a powerful story that shines light on one of Papua New Guinea’s most tragic yet overlooked chapters — the Japanese invasion of Rabaul during World War II.
The novel follows journalist Isabel Lee, who travels to Rabaul after the 1994 volcanic eruption to uncover its lost history. Her discovery of an old photograph unravels the story of Henry Meyer, the son of German-Australian plantation owners, and his love for Lin, a Chinese woman, amid the chaos of war.
The book captures the terror, love, and survival of those who lived through the Pacific War, when thousands were left behind as the Japanese advanced.
Jones said her inspiration came from real accounts of Australian nurses, soldiers, and Chinese civilians who suffered through the 1942 occupation. “When I started researching A Forgotten Land, I was amazed by the depth of history in Rabaul. It’s a place that has seen more devastation than anywhere else in PNG, and yet it’s rarely spoken about,” she said.
She highlighted the scale of the tragedy: 1,800 Australians were abandoned when Japan invaded, including 18 nurses taken as POWs at Vunapope Catholic Mission and 800 Chinese civilians interned at Ratongor Catholic Mission.
“Other than Berlin, Rabaul was bombed more than any other place in WW2. And yet, no one talks about this. No one talks about the town’s resilience in building itself back up after the 1937 eruption of Tavurvur, and again after WW2. No one talks about the eight hundred Australians that were killed on the Montevideo Maru when the US mistakenly attacked it. More Australians died in Rabaul than in Kokoda and yet it’s not honored the same way.
“This is important history. It should be remembered,” Jones added.
Known for her debut novel A Dangerous Land, which delicately explored PNG’s colonial past, Jones hopes her new release will spark a deeper appreciation for the resilience of Rabaul and its people, who rebuilt their lives after both the 1937 volcanic eruption and the destruction of World War II.
A Forgotten Land is available for purchase at Brian Bell, Gordon, and Duffy Café in Port Moresby. Jones will meet readers and sign copies on Saturday, October 25. More information can be found at www.marisajonesbooks.com"
Minister Reaffirms Rule of Law Over Customary Settlements,21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6536,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"Minister for Police, Peter Tsiamalili Jnr has commended the recent decision by Justice Graham Ellis, who sentenced a man to 20 years’ imprisonment for willful murder.
“The recent ruling by Justice Graham Ellis in Enga Province serves as a timely and important reminder: the rule of law must always stand above compensation and customary settlements,” Tsiamalili said.
The Minister affirmed the Government’s unwavering commitment to the principle that compensation is not an alternative to the application of criminal law.
“While traditional reconciliation practices remain a valued part of our cultural heritage, they cannot substitute the formal processes of justice under the laws of Papua New Guinea,” he said.
Tsiamalili Jnr emphasised that the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) must uphold the criminal standard prescribed by law, without fear or compromise.
“Police officers are not mediators — they are enforcers of the law. Their duty is to investigate, arrest, and charge offenders without fear or favour. It is then the responsibility of our courts to determine guilt and impose appropriate sentences based on the evidence presented,” he said.
The Minister reiterated that a clear separation of roles between police and judiciary is essential to maintaining peace, ensuring fairness, and protecting communities from the growing culture of impunity.
“Every officer of the RPNGC must remember that the strength of our nation depends on their commitment to justice, discipline, and the Constitution,” he said.
Tsiamalili Jnr concluded by reaffirming the Government’s support for the judiciary in upholding justice for all.
“No life lost should be treated lightly, and no law broken should go unanswered. We must ensure that our legal institutions remain strong, impartial, and respected — so that every citizen can have confidence in the rule of law,” he said."
"Houses burnt, several injured in Chimbu tribal clash",21/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6533,,Local,Anger,Nill,"Five houses burnt, and several people have sustained injuries following a tribal fight between the Era and Kalubiagao tribes in Digine, Gumini district in Chimbu Province on Monday, October 20.
Simbu Provincial Police Commander Mazuc Rubiang confirmed that the fight between the two tribes started late yesterday after a serving member of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, who is on leave, was attacked by youths from the Era tribe during a drinking brawl.
He said guns were used in the fight, which resulted in shots being fired and several people injured, including the burning down of five houses. Police are investigating the matter.
""I thank the Taskforce police units who were onsite after the situation was reported. Those who were involved will be identified and dealt with. Some innocent people had been injured and also lost their properties. I have been raising awareness about how alcohol has caused lives and damage to homes and properties. The incident that happened last night is a result of drinking alcohol. We will investigate all of them,"" PPC Rubiang said.
At 4 a.m. today, PPC Rubiang was with his officers to make sure the situation was under control and no more fighting.
PPC Rubiang said they had spoken to both tribal groups to assist police in identifying those involved.

Why PNGUoT’s dining hall cost more,20/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6510,,Education,Anger,Nill,"The Papua New Guinea University of Technology’s (PNGUoT) new dining hall cost more than what was initally budgeted due to the contractor’s financial incapabilities.
Chancellor Sam Koim repeated that because the project went beyond its deadline by three years, the cost of the project – including associated costs – had inflated the project value.
The initial value of PNGUoT’s dining hall project, which was K17.4 million, was awarded by the National Executive Council to a local contractor, who started construction in April 2021. The project was expected to be completed by August 2022.
“But after the contract was awarded – and let me be frank here, the payment was paid in full but what we received was 65 percent of the project,” outlined Chancellor Sam Koim during the recent opening of their K30 million dining hall.
“And this is something that I would like to highlight here – nothing disparaging to the contractor but – I’d like to make this point that Papua New Guinean contractors need to learn to deliver contracts according to scope, design and value for money.
“Papua New Guinean contractors think that as soon as the first instalment, mobilisation is given or the second phase payment is given, they think that it’s their profit already. And they take that money and use it all over the place and leave the contract unattended to.
“And this is a classic example of a lesson we’ve learnt the hard way.”
Due to the incomplete work, PNGUoT allocated an additional K10 million from its own savings to complete the project.
Other areas, aside from construction, had to be funded as well, including the setting up of the temporary mess operations, together with kitchen equipment, modern kitchen equipment and furniture for the new dining hall, the legal costs of defending the dispute arising out of contract termination of the failed contract, and the impacts of inflation and exchange rates caused by years of delay from the contractor’s failure to deliver.
“The university had to outsource catering services to a private contractor,” continued Koim.
“That catering work costed us about K16 million a year. And at that time, we decided to part ways with the private contractor. It was very challenging but we took the decisive step to terminate the contract with the catering services.
“We took it on board and since then, we’ve save K9 million every year after we’ve terminated that contract. So, for the last six years, we’ve saved over K50 million.”
“It is one great achievement for the university,” said an emotional vice chancellor, Professor Ora Renagi.
“I will take pictures and go show the development partners, even the government departments, that look at this; Unitech has been able to persistently drive this project to completion. And today, we are very proudly standing at the university, showing everybody that we can deliver.
“Come and work with us. Come and partner with us. Come and join us, and let’s build our university to world standards.”"

Alotau receives medical supplies by road,20/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6509,,Health,Trust,Elias Kapavore,"A milestone was achieved when medical supplies to the Milne Bay Provincial Health Authority were delivered by road from Port Moresby recently.
Minister for Health Elias Kapavore said this is history brought about by the Government’s flagship Connect PNG program.
Minister Kapavore said Express Custom Logistics (ECL), the Southern Region Logistics Distribution contractor, was engaged by the Health Department to deliver these supplies.
“Two Isuzu dyna, and two open-back land cruisers trucks loaded with 620 cartons earmarked for the Milne Bay Provincial Health Authority.  Thank you to the Minister for Works and Highways, but especially, giving credit to the flagship, Connect PNG program by the Marape-Rosso Government,” Minister Kapavore said.
After 17 hours of navigating the long stretch of road between Port Moresby and Alotau, the delivery team arrived safely at 6:30 pm in Alotau.
Chief Executive Officer of Milne Bay Provincial Health Authority, Dr. Perista Mamadi, confirmed that the delivery team had to cross three big rivers on the Milne Bay side to get to the province.
“I was worried for the Abau side because of the mud, but it was dry. On the Milne Bay side, the team had to cross three rivers. One of the rivers was high, so they had to put off the engines and pull the vehicles across the river. They did well and arrived at 6:30 pm, Saturday, at the ECL warehouse,” Dr Mamadi said.
This morning, the ECL delivered the medical supplies to the Milne Bay PHA Medical Store. They are now at Alotau Provincial Hospital to load the empty oxygen cylinders."
PNGDF – ADF relations strengthened,20/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6513,,Politics,Trust,Billy Joseph,"Minister for Defence Dr Billy Joseph met with his Australian counterpart and deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles in Canberra today to begin the pathway of Defence partners to allies under the PNG-Australia Mutual Defence Treaty – the Pukpuk Treaty.
The Ministers underlined their commitment to establish a bilateral taskforce to oversee the development of a recruitment pathway to enable PNG citizens to join the Australian Defence Force (ADF).
Relevant officials from Australia and PNG will meet in person prior to the end of 2025, further refining a methodical and considered recruitment pathway.
As the first step, eligible permanent residents living in Australia who are also PNG citizens will be able to apply to join the ADF from 1 January 2026 – with a view to welcoming the first applicants next year.
The Ministers also agreed to continue supporting the growth and development of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) as an independent sovereign military.
Australia and PNG will also upgrade vital facilities at the Goldie River Training Depot outside Port Moresby.
This investment will see the delivery of new accommodation and essential services for up to 200 additional PNGDF trainees, with an expected completion in late 2026.
The upgraded training facilities will see an increase in the number of recruit and career courses that can be run concurrently.
Australia will also work in close collaboration with PNG on a design for a new PNGDF infantry battalion barracks in Hela Province.
This work would ensure that a similar design concept could be applied and adapted to other locations across PNG.
Interoperability between the two defence forces is a priority under the new Alliance.
The Ministers further agreed to identify common land force capabilities that will enable our militaries to work even more closely together.
Shared capabilities will streamline standard operating procedures and maximise training opportunities during military exercises.
They have agreed to further uplift PNGDF’s capability through the provision of Australian-made combat rifles.
The rollout of replacement weapons will include further work on armories and additional steps to enhance weapons security.
Australia and PNG will also expand defence aviation cooperation by building on current pilot, aircrew, and aircraft maintenance training initiatives under the Flights of Excellence program.
From 2026, Australia will support the training of up to six pilots from the PNGDF each year to build their air capacity, in addition to training for engineers and other air crew.
A strong aviation safety culture is crucial to our commitment to build a sustainable sovereign air capability with PNG.
Our Alliance is a natural evolution of our close and longstanding defence ties, seen earlier this year when PNG hosted the first ever component of exercise Talisman Sabre outside Australia, and last week with the involvement of three Army Chinook helicopters in Exercise Wantok Warrior – which has been conducted every year since 2009.
The Pukpuk Treaty will take this to the next level.
The alliance reflects our commitment to each other and to a region that is peaceful, stable and prosperous.
Together, Australia and PNG will continue to build unique partnership for the betterment of the two nations and their people."

Hela’s partnership in development praised,19/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6496,,Development,Joy,Nill,"Last week, Tari in Hela province witnessed the signing and ribbon-cutting of four major projects. This signals a new chapter of partnership, progress, and prosperity for the province and its project-impacted communities.
The ceremonies held on Friday, October 17, brought together key development partners, including ExxonMobil PNG, Mineral Resources Development Company, Petroleum Resources Kutubu, PNG Power Ltd, Dirio Power, the Hela Provincial Government, China Railway Company, Internal Revenue Commission (IRC), and local landowner companies and leaders.
Prime Minister Marape, who is also Tari-Pori MP, said the initiatives launched today reflect the government’s vision of ensuring that project areas such as Hela see tangible benefits from their resource contributions to the national economy.
“Today is a good day for Hela — a day when we are seeing the rewards of our patience and partnership. This province has carried the national economy for decades through its oil and gas projects, and it is only right that the people of Hela also enjoy the fruits of that contribution,” said PM Marape.
He commended the cooperation between the State, provincial government, and landowners, and private sector partners, describing it as a practical demonstration of inclusive development under the Connect PNG and Take Back PNG policies.
The Prime Minister also highlighted that some landowner funds were released. This marked an important milestone for local communities that have long awaited the fulfillment of their benefits.
“For too long, our landowners have waited for what is rightfully theirs. Today, as these funds reach your accounts, I encourage you to use them wisely to build your homes, educate your children, and invest in small businesses that will sustain your families and your future,” he said.
The four significant signings included:
Support for Rural Health Services
PRK signed an agreement with the Hela Provincial Health Authority to provide incentives for doctors serving in remote areas — a major boost for rural healthcare delivery in Hela.
“This investment in health is an investment in life. Our doctors working in remote areas deserve recognition, and I commend PRK and the PHA for this partnership that will save lives,” said PM Marape.
Construction of Hela Hilton Heritage Hotel
Landowners from Kutubu, Hides, Moran, Angore, and Juha through MRDC and Hela
Investment Limited signed to develop the Hela Hilton Heritage Hotel — a project that will create jobs, promote tourism, and showcase Hela’s cultural identity.
“This hotel will be a symbol of Hela’s progress — a modern facility built by our own people to welcome the world to our beautiful province,” said the Prime Minister.
Electrification by Landowner Company Transpower Ltd
A local landowner company entered into an agreement to extend power reticulation across Hela, advancing the Government’s rural electrification goals under Connect PNG.
5MW Power Supply by ExxonMobil
ExxonMobil PNG signed a commitment to supply 5 megawatts of power to Hela, a major boost that will power local industries, schools, and hospitals.
PM Marape personally thanked ExxonMobil, PNG Power, and other stakeholders for their commitment:
“Hela has been in the dark since the beginning of the PNG LNG project. Today, Power is finally coming to our homes, schools, and hospitals. This is the light of development our people have been waiting for.”"
Retired teachers' entitlements paid,19/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6500,,Government,Joy,Nill,"The Department of Treasury has released K19.5 million as final entitlements and repatriation funds to 570 retired teachers in Papua New Guinea.
The employer of teachers, the Teaching Service Commission (TSC), confirmed this long-awaited news to teachers who visited Vulupindi Haus, Port Moresby, on Thursday, October 16, 2025, to inquire about their payments.
TSC Commissioner Operation, Maini Mike Ugaia, on behalf of 70,000 teachers, including retirees, thanked the Department of Treasury for making this payment available.
He said this is the 3rd batch of retiree payments.
Ugaia said these 570 retirees will receive their payment before the end of this year. He told the retirees present that the payment process had been slow due to the involvement of multiple agencies and the need for due diligence.
However, Ugaia assured them that retirees would now receive their entitlements. The repatriation payment applies only to retired teachers, not resigned teachers, says TSC.
“Retiring means you have served this country until you are 60 years old, and as a token of appreciation, we pay you your entitlements along with repatriation,” he said. Due to the lengthy time frame and challenges faced by retired teachers, TSC’s involvement since 2024 aims to resolve issues among teachers, provinces, and the Treasury.
Ugaia said that TSC’s Industrial Team is working on the next batch of retirees' entitlements. Once it is done, the files will be sent to the Treasury Department for funding.
He extended his gratitude to Treasury, the Department of Education, and TSC officers for their dedication to the process.
TSC Principal Advisor Industrial, Esban Rita Karo, urged Salaries Officers from all the provinces to compile exit files for all outstanding exits and also recently approved exits from their provinces and send them to TSC Headquarters so calculations can be checked and included for the funding bid to the Treasury Department.
“The files contain the teachers' records from the day when they were first admitted into the Teaching Service, and we also check the salary history to ensure they have not taken furlough leave, because if they have taken furlough leave, service paid would be from the date they resume teaching after the furlough. That’s the reason why we are insisting that the files must come,” Mrs Karo said.
She said this applies to exit members who were already in service before 2003 when the Alesco system was introduced. Teachers who started teaching in 2003 and current have their records in the system, making it easier to review their records.
The TSC expressed appreciation to the retirees for their years of service to Papua New Guinea, and also for their patience in waiting for their entitlements to be paid."

LOs urged to work in unity for LNG benefits,19/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6499,,Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has called on landowners from the PNG LNG project areas to resolve ongoing disputes, to enable the release of over K800 million currently held in trust for their benefit.
Speaking in Tari following the signing of the PNG LNG gas-fired power supply Memorandum of Understanding on Friday, October 17, Prime Minister Marape said while some 30 court cases among various landowner groups are before the courts, the Government is ready to pay out funds to undisputed clans whose entitlements have been verified.
He said more than K800 million has been transferred into trust accounts for landowners.
“We are ready to release these funds to those clans and land groups that have no disputes. For those who are still in dispute, I appeal to you to resolve your issues quickly — either through the courts or through mutual settlement — so everyone can benefit.”
The Prime Minister stated that the lengthy court battles have postponed much-needed benefits to legitimate landowners and called on all parties to act in the national interest.
“This is the money our economy needs,” he said. “It should not be sitting idle in the banks while our people continue to struggle. Once released, this money will circulate through our economy — to build homes, start businesses, and improve lives across the project areas.”
Prime Minister Marape also appealed to the judiciary to expedite the hearing of landowner cases, ensuring that legitimate recipients can access their funds without further delay.
Meantime, in bringing government services closer to Hela, Prime Minister Marape also opened the Hela Haus 2 building in Tari. The building will house key government and commercial offices to decentralise essential services back to the province.
The ground floor of the new modern facility will host a BSP Financial Group branch, while the upper floors will accommodate offices for:
• Mineral Resources Development Company
• Department of Petroleum
• Internal Revenue Commission
• Investment Promotion Authority
“I do not want our landowners and citizens travelling to Port Moresby to look for government offices,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“The government must come back and live in Hela Province. We are building modern offices so that our people can access services directly at home, where the oil and gas resources come from.”
He commended Governor Philip Undialu and the Hela Provincial Government for using royalty and development levy funds responsibly to invest in modern infrastructure, and MRDC for taking up office space to serve landowners more effectively."
Pacific pilgrims arrive in Rome ahead of P Blessed Peter To Rot’s Canonisation,18/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6484,,Religion,Joy,Nill,"Pilgrims and bishops from Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Solomon Islands have arrived in Rome in anticipation for the canonisation of Blessed Peter To Rot, set to take place this Sunday. The historic event, which will see To Rot and six other Blesseds elevated to sainthood by the Catholic Church, has drawn a large contingent of faithfuls from across the Pacific and around the globe to the Vatican.
Upon arrival in Rome, the pilgrims joined thousands of others from different corners of the world, all converging at St. Peter's Square and the surrounding areas to celebrate this significant occasion.
In this article, written by Sr Daisy Lisania who is also in the Vatican, “The atmosphere is one of great joy and anticipation as participants prepare for the solemn canonisation ceremony, which will be led by Pope Leo XlV”.
At the forefront of the Vatican's preparations, the pictures of seven saints, including Peter To Rot, to be canonised this Sunday, are prominently displayed on the front wall of St. Peter's Basilica. These striking portraits serve as a visual tribute to the diverse and inspiring lives of those being elevated to sainthood, representing different cultures, countries, and spiritual legacies.
In addition to ToRot’s canonisation, the event underscores the universal nature of the Catholic faith, with people from every corner of the globe coming together to honour the lives of these remarkable men and women. The presence of bishops and pilgrims from PNG and the Solomon Islands is particularly significant, highlighting the deep-rooted Catholic tradition in the Pacific region.
For the people of PNG and the Solomon Islands, Peter To Rot’s canonisation is a monumental moment in their spiritual journey, commemorating the courage and unwavering faith of a man who stood firm in his beliefs, even in the face of persecution.
Blessed Peter To Rot was executed by the Japanese during World War II for his role in leading the Catholic community in Papua New Guinea. His legacy as a martyr and symbol of resilience has made a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the faithful worldwide.
As pilgrims gather in Rome to witness this historic event, many are reflecting on the significance of To Rot’s sainthood, while also celebrating the strength and unity of the global Catholic community. The canonisation ceremony is expected to attract a vast crowd, with thousands of faithful expected to fill St. Peter’s Square, eagerly awaiting the moment when Peter To Rot is officially declared a saint.
The festivities will continue through the weekend, with special Masses and prayers held across Rome in tribute to the new saints, culminating in the canonisation Mass on Sunday."
Advanced coconut processing hub,18/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6482,,Politics,Anger,Richard Maru,"The recent announcement by Minister Richard Maru regarding a Coconut Downstream Processing Hub in Madang province, specifically proposed for Siar, has sparked a strong, immediate counter-commentary from retired PNGDF Major Tony Dibul.
Mr.Dibul is from Karkar Island of Sumkar District in Madang province, which is the largest coconut producing district with a total of one million coconuts out of three million in the province. He is also a farmer himself and speaking on behalf of his community and the islanders of Karkar.
Mr. Dibul states that while the intention to establish value added coconut production is commendable, the selection of Siar or anywhere on the Madang mainland is profoundly ill informed and this demonstrates a critical failure to consult local expertise and recognize the undisputed epicenter of Madang’s and indeed Papua New Guineas coconut industry: Karkar Island.
“Any serious program for value added coconut end products in PNG must, first and foremost, be anchored where the resource is most abundant, secure and established. That location is Karkar Island in the Sumkar district,” he said.
Captain Dibul added that Karkar Islands dominance in coconut production is not up for debate. Karkar is reputed to host approximately one third of all coconut trees in PNG, with continuous new seedling propagation reinforcing this massive supply base. Within Madang Province, Sumkar (Karkar) dominates the coconut sector, as the mainland lacks significant dedicated coconut plantations. This sheer volume of raw material makes Karkar the logistical and economic imperative.
Furthermore, Karkar’s geographical isolation provides a crucial non-negotiable advantage: biosecurity. History shows that devastating crop diseases like the Bogia Coconut Syndrome (BCS) and the Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB) have found it difficult to establish and spread on the island. Establishing a major processing hub on the mainland, close to other areas of vulnerability is an unnecessary and significant risk to the entire investment.
He elaborates more on the argument that Karkar is too remote or lacks the necessary infrastructure is simply false, outdated or misleading.
•	Production maturity: Karkar boasts a unique ecosystem of large, established coconut producing plantations operating in tandem with dedicated local block holder farmers, ensuring a diverse and consistent supply chain.
•	Infrastructure advantage: Karkar already possesses essential agricultural infrastructure, which would significantly reduce project start-up costs compared to building entirely new facilities at Siar.
•	Logistical capacity: Crucially, Karkar already has National Maritime Safety Authority (NMSA) rated wharfage and facilities capable of berthing overseas shipping direct. This bypasses unnecessary double handling and trans-shipment costs from the island to the mainland and then to an international port, streamlining export logistics.
•	Advanced product provenance: Karkar is already far superior in the production of advanced coconut products. The presence of ventures like Kulili Estates Bio Fuel demonstrates local capacity and expertise in moving beyond copra to high-value goods like cosmetics, detergents, fuel and lubricants. This is 110 years of life experience with the coconut tree being manifested.
“For Karkar, coconut and Karkar are synonymous. The island’s entire economy and identity are sheltered and sustained by the coconut tree – it’s not just a cash crop; it’s a way of life. There is the need for consultation and accountability.
Minister Maru’s method of announcement and selection overriding local knowledge and without demonstratable consultation with Madang leaders, is deeply concerning. The People’s First Party (PFP) cannot be allowed to dictate and ride roughshod over the backs of Madang’s elected representatives and traditional custodians of the resource.
The Minister’s track record in Madang which includes failure to deliver on the promised Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) and the much-lauded Vidar Special Economic Zone (SEZ), casts a long shadow. Now, he is championing an SEZ at Siar for this coconut venture.
Given this history on non-delivery on major projects, Madang must not allow the Minister and PFP to unilaterally determine the location of a key provincial investment,” Mr. Dibul stated.
In concluding his oratory Captain Dibul demands fairness for Karkar island stating that the logical, economical and practical choice for the Advanced Coconut end product processing facility is undeniably Karkar Island. To place the factory on the Madang mainland, specifically at Siar, when the primary high volume, secure raw material source is an island possessing the necessary port, infrastructure and advanced processing expertise, is an irrational decision.
“The factory is an opportunity to directly empower the 110 years of coconut life experience that defines Karkar. It is only fair and fitting that the processing bub be built where the coconut is king, where the production is proven, and where the logistical framework is already in place.
Therefore, the Minister and Governor Pariwa must rescind the current plan and consult with the people and leaders of Sumkar to establish the hub on Karkar Island – the rightful home of PNG’s coconut industry,” he stressed."
Disgruntled students query subsidy payment,18/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6483,,Education,Anger,Nill,"The Eastern Highlands Students Union at the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) is demanding fairness in school fee subsidy from the Eastern Highlands Provincial Government. Union president Millan Usoni said while it is not a right, the school fee subsidy program should cover students attending UPNG too.
According to Usoni, the provincial government has subsidized school fees for EHP students attending tertiary institutions in the country, except UPNG.
In a media release dated 15th October, the provincial government stated that its students attending UPNG would have received their portion of the subsidy had the university not done away with bulk deposits or payments.
Provincial Simon Sia said, “Our officers have communicated with the UPNG Bursars' office to find out suitable ways to pay the fees for students.”
“Even they don't bother to respond to our call. Who is at fault?
“The payment has been made online, and student leaders are asked to check with their Finance team. A total K343,500.00 was paid for 173 students who applied and met all the requirements of the subsidy program.
“Student leaders must check with the school Bursar and confirm that the remittance advice received from the Premium Banking confirms the funds being deposited into the UPNG account,” Sia said.
He added that the provincial government made the deposit into the university account on October 6, 2025 and that the money should already be cleared. He urged student leaders to follow up on the payment.
The student union refutes that any payment was made into the university account after checking with the school bursar. The students urge the provincial government to rectify this issue before they can go home for the holidays."
Minor adjustments to Grade 8 Exam dates,18/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6485,,Education,Anticipation,Nill,"With Grade 8 national examinations set to start on Monday, 20 October 2025, schools can expect slight changes to the calendar due to delay in the distribution of exam materials from Port Moresby.
Grade 8 examinations were originally scheduled to take place from Monday, 20th October to Thursday, 23rd October 2025 and this schedule will remain.
However, the Department has advised Provincial Education Authorities and schools to be prepared for slight adjustments where necessary.
Dr. Kombra explained that the exam papers arrived at the Measurement Services Division (MSD) a few days later than usual, and while all materials have been dispatched through Air Niugini Cargo to the provinces, some deliveries may experience delays due to flight disruptions and rescheduling.
“In case some schools do not receive their examination papers on time, Provincial Education Authorities may reschedule the exams to be completed by Friday, 24th October 2025.
Any further changes beyond this date must be approved by my office,” Dr Kombra said.
The Secretary also reminded all school administrations to take full responsibility for the safe storage, security, and fair administration of all examination materials in their care.
Provincial Education Advisors, Examination Supervisors, and Primary Inspectors have been instructed to communicate this notice to all schools in their respective provinces."
PPL supports 15-mile police,18/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6486,,Business,Trust,Nill,"PNG Power Ltd (PPL) has demonstrated its commitment to strengthening law and order by providing support to the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC). PPL donated computer equipment and office furniture to 15-Mile Police Station outside Port Moresby City in NCD on Wednesday 16th October, 2025.

“PPL supported the police station with a fully kitted Hilux two years ago but our support doesn’t end here. PPL also hopes to help the Sogeri Police Station as well,” Mr Tuheana said.
This move demonstrates the importance of public-private partnerships in PNG, where state-owned enterprises and the business community step in to help resource essential services like the police, thereby contributing directly to safer communities for all citizens.
The event was witnessed by Central Police Station Commander Inspector Ken Pamenda, PPC Central Chief Inspector Joseph Salle, community leaders, police and PPL staff."
EU Ambassador presents Credentials,18/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6490,,International,Trust,Nill,"The European Union (EU) has reaffirmed its strong and enduring partnership with Papua New Guinea (PNG) through a renewed commitment to peace, development, and climate action.
This came as the newly appointed EU Ambassador to PNG, Erika Hasznos officially presented her Letters of Credence to the Governor General at Government House on October 17, 2025.

National Exams Remain; Selections to be Phased Out,17/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6475,,Education,Trust,Nill,"Education Secretary Dr. Uke Kombra has clarified the future of student assessments, stating that while national examinations will continue as a necessary part of the education system, the process of selecting students for the next grade level is being changed.
Speaking on the department's plans, Dr. Kombra confirmed that the system of 'graded accumulations’ will remain, meaning students' overall performance will still be recorded and tracked.
Selections however are being ""phased out"" - a move understood to be part of the government's push to achieve Universal Basic Education, allowing more students to complete full 13 years of schooling up to Grade 12.
Dr. Kombra reassured the public that the core function of testing would not be removed.
""Exam will still remain!""
He explained that after teachers deliver the content, they must assess students through class tests and term tests to see how much they have learned.
""Then we have a national test to compare,"" Dr. Kombra noted, highlighting the need for a national standard. This is to ensure fairness and to test students’ capability and ability to move to other grades respectively.
""We do a national exam to see which ones are really, really doing a real test, assessment, and teaching and all that. So that's part of the learning process,"" he stated.
The purpose of these exams is to assess students' actual achievement of the course content.
In conclusion, Dr. Kombra emphasised that as long as the education system exists, the process of assessment and examinations will always be a part of it."
IMPACT Health Project restructure,16/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6470,,Health,Anticipation,Nill,"The World Bank-financed “Improving Access to and Value from Health Services in PNG: Financing the Frontlines (IMPACT Health)” Project, implemented by the National Department of Health (NDoH), held a Special Project Steering Committee (PSC) meeting in Port Moresby recently to discuss a possible project restructure and extension.
The PSC meeting was chaired by Manah Dindi, Acting Deputy Secretary for National Health Policy and Corporate Services, on behalf of the Project Director, Acting Health Secretary Ken Wai.
The main agenda was to seek endorsement and approval from the Project Steering Committee for a project restructure and extension, including a change to the project end date, to allow sufficient time for the implementation of two large-scale contracts valued at US$11.8 million and US$2.4 million respectively - representing 47 percent of the total project cost.
These contracts include the purchase of medical equipment for 157 health facilities and the refurbishment of 16 health facilities across the four project provinces.
The request to change the current project closing date from June 30, 2026, to June 1, 2028, is based on the understanding that the two large-scale contracts will undergo the appropriate government procurement procedures and obtain the necessary authorizations, with signing expected by December 1, 2025.
The IMPACT Health Project is a US$30 million initiative that underscores the importance of strengthening the quality and utilization of frontline service delivery using existing government systems. It focuses on enhancing primary health care in rural and remote communities within the project provinces, while also providing tools and financing to Provincial Health Authorities (PHAs) to improve service delivery and capacity.
The project introduces a Performance-Based Financing system known as Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs), designed to align incentives between the national, provincial, and facility levels of health care delivery.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) — to increase the utilization of quality essential health services in the project-supported provinces of East New Britain, Central, East Sepik, and Simbu — remains unchanged. Under the key PDOs:
Level 2–4 Health Facilities achieving a Minimum Service Quality Score: Out of 157 facilities surveyed, 149 were assessed, and 85% (126 out of 149) achieved a Minimum Service Quality Score of 60% or above.
Percentage increase in outreach clinics conducted: 16,327 outreach visits were conducted between July 2024 and June 30, 2025 — a 78% increase over the baseline (target for Year 4: 10,990).
Percentage increase in pregnant women receiving four or more antenatal care check-ups: 15,652 women attended their fourth antenatal care visit between July 2024 and June 30, 2025  - a 13% increase over the baseline.
Percentage increase in children under one year receiving the Pentavalent 3rd vaccine: 38,030 children under one year received the vaccine between July 2024 and June 30, 2025  - an 87% increase over the baseline.
The two major contracts pending implementation under the IMPACT Health Project include: Health Facility Audit and Investment Contract – covering facility audits, supply of medical equipment, and refurbishment of selected health facilities.
Upskilling and Community Engagement Contract – aimed at strengthening workforce capacity and community participation in health initiatives.
The NDoH, through the National Health Service Standards and Facility Branch and National Health Policy and Corporate Services Division, will play a key role in implementing these contracts, supported by the IMPACT Health Project team in providing oversight and coordination.
The special PSC meeting was attended by NDoH Senior Executive Management (SEM) and representatives from key central government agencies, including the Department of National Planning and Monitoring (DNPM), Department of Treasury (DoT), Department of Finance (DoF), and the National Procurement Commission (NPC)."
A faith-driven approach to youth and child welfare,16/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6465,,Politics,Trust,"Noah Kool, Powes Parkop","During a formal inquiry into social services for children and youth, held by the Special Parliamentary Committee on Children and Youth on October 14–15 2025, Chimbu Provincial Member Noah Kool reaffirmed Chimbu’s commitment to faith-based development as a cornerstone of provincial progress.
The inquiry, chaired by NCD Governor Powes Parkop and hosted by the National Department for Community Development, provided a platform for provinces to share innovative approaches to youth and child welfare.
Kool used the session to highlight Chimbu’s “Back to God” initiative — a homegrown program that predates the national Christian Country policy as a model for integrating faith into development.
“Before Parliament passed the policy, Chimbu had already gone back to God,” he said.
Under the initiative, the province has supported over 110 churches with logistical resources, including vehicles for the Body of Christ in each district.
“We’re now replicating this model across the province,” Kool said, emphasizing that churches are not only spiritual leaders but also frontline partners in delivering health, education, and social services.
One million kina from the Provincial Services Improvement Program (PSIP) has been allocated to church organizations, a move Kool described as ‘true partnership’. He stressed that faith-based groups are ‘uniquely positioned to reach communities where government services are stretched thin.
“This is the foundation we’re building on,” he said. “Churches are helping us move forward.”
The inquiry underscored the growing recognition of churches as development actors — not just in Chimbu, but across the country — as provinces seek holistic, community-rooted solutions to youth and child welfare."
Women researchers in Australia for advanced training,15/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6452,,International,Joy,Nill,"The Australian High Commission hosted an event to farewell 12 Papua New Guinean women researchers departing for advanced training in Australia last week.
This event marked PNG Australia Partnership’s commitment to strengthening research capacity and gender equality.
The APEC Study Centre at RMIT University, Melbourne, is delivering a three-year research capacity-building program for women researchers. The program aims to enhance their skills in agriculture and economics, promoting evidence-based decision-making and in support of long-term economic development.
The event recognised the achievements of the researchers who were selected from a competitive field, following a successful training workshop in Port Moresby in June 2025. The cohort will spend four weeks at leading Australian research institutions, gaining practical experience and building professional networks.
The 12 researchers departing for Australia are: Elizabeth Dumu from Brian Bell Group; Crystal Kewe from Crysan Technology; Gretel Matawan from the Consultative Implementation and Monitoring Council; Everlyn Iniga Norman from the Institute of Business Studies; Isabella Yakali and Susan Sapa from the Bank of PNG; Joecy Kabiu and Logea Nao from the National Research Institute; and Imelda Zillah Atu, Patricia Angopa and Anna Kapil from UPNG.
Logea Nao, speaking on behalf of the women researchers, said: “As PNG enters into the next 50 years, the strengthening research capacity for women researchers is a fitting investment by the government and the people of Australia, not just for strengthening research capacity, but broadly for strengthening research collaboration, and by extension, strengthening people-to-people links between Australia and PNG. So on behalf of the 12 awardees, I say thank you.”
Fellow researcher Imelda Atu added that the women researchers appreciated being allowed to participate in this program.
“I am pretty sure we will go down there, and we will learn a lot. When we come back, we will be able to share and also network with other fellow researchers, as well as what knowledge and skills that we have gained from them. We are looking into collaborating with other women researchers,” she said.
The program encourages ongoing collaboration among participants, including sharing ideas, resources, and experiences. This emerging network will help build lasting connections and support peer learning beyond the formal training.
The capacity building program complements other Australian Government-supported initiatives aimed at advancing inclusive economic growth in Papua New Guinea."
837 DWU undergraduates missioned,15/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6455,,Education,Joy,Nill,"Divine Word University graduates will attest that receiving the cross during missioning validates graduating from the institution. This year marks the 17th Missioning ceremony for 837 students who will graduate next year.
The cross not only indicates their eligibility for graduation, but it also signifies a customary ritual of sending out its ambassadors to the world, equipped with the institution's ethics, values and principles.
Families, friends, and parents were able to witness this ceremony themed “Living our noble traditions and Christian principles” and take their loved ones back home to face the world after four years at the Divine Word University in Madang province.
President of DWU Professor Fr. Philip Gibbs said the missioning was a time of Thanksgiving, appreciation, and blessing which will be given to students in a cross.
Fr. Gibbs elaborated that the event will bring many joyous moments with family and friends, some may be sad, and others will feel indifferent. This goes to show how they will approach life after university, and some may tackle the unknown full head-on, whilst others may tread along with caution.
He also encouraged the missioning students to reflect on the blessings that they had received while being students of DWU. Their support from families, friends, and the DWU community, and how fortunate they have been during their studies at the institution.
The President reminded them that life is full of opportunities and they should never lose hope or sight of their goals. Being equipped with the tools to take on life’s journey and how they can make a positive impact on developing the country.
The to-be graduates were reminded of their purpose in life and to fulfill that purpose in becoming agents of change and development.
“Making Papua New Guinea a better place for everybody. The cross that you will receive is a symbol of Gods power within you, guiding you to make wise ethical decisions in all the things you do,” Fr. Gibbs stated.
Keynote speaker, Ps. Veneo Kario of the Foursquare Church congratulated the students on their accomplishment and for the ceremony dedicated to their achievements. He pointed out to the students that they were lucky to be celebrated and to be blessed to go out as ambassadors of DWU. He encouraged the missioning students to be thankful and just as the country celebrated its 50 years, much emphasis was put on the word “reset”.
Ps. Kario encouraged students to go out into the world and make their mark in the country’s clean slate for the next 50 years.
“It is your time to write out history as the country stands at the threshold of the next 50 years. Madang was recognized as having the best independence celebrations, even though Port Moresby had spectacular events. This goes to show how you can also impact positively wherever you may go,” Ps. Kario said."

PM Marape commends Wantok Radio Light,15/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6459,,Culture,Joy,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has commended Wantok Radio Light for its enduring role in spreading positive, faith-based messages across Papua New Guinea, describing it as an “instrument of hope” that uplifts hearts and guides young people toward productive and meaningful lives.
Speaking during a visit to the Wantok Radio Light studios on the occasion of its 24th anniversary, the Prime Minister highlighted the vital importance of media that nurtures the moral and spiritual wellbeing of the nation.
“What our people hear, watch, and see influences their hearts and their direction in life,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“That is why stations like Wantok Radio Light are so important — to make sure the right voices, the right music, and the right messages are heard.”
He cautioned that in today’s fast-changing world, young people are being shaped by secular and sometimes harmful influences online and on social media.
“We must fill the airwaves and digital spaces with good content that uplifts the soul,” he said. “Wantok Radio Light is doing exactly that — using technology to carry words that heal, inspire, and guide people back to faith and purpose.”
Marape also reaffirmed his government’s commitment to supporting church-led and faith-based initiatives that build human capital and empower communities.
He said the Government will continue to back programmes such as Second Chance Education, Continuing Education, SME Training, and Labour Mobility Pathways, all of which align with the broader Christian and social development agenda.
“Many of our youth have dropped out of school or lost their way,” the Prime Minister said. “Stations like Wantok Radio Light can help us reach them — to tell them there is still a path forward through education, work, and faith.”
He noted that the Government’s partnerships with institutions and development partners, including Australia, are designed to open employment and training pathways for young Papua New Guineans both at home and abroad.
“When our young people go out to work, learn new skills, and come back home to serve their communities, that is nation-building in action,” he said.
The Prime Minister further described churches and faith-based media as the “watchmen of society,” guiding national conscience and moral direction.
While the Government cannot directly run every radio station, he said, it stands ready to support good initiatives that promote national values and positive content.
“Churches have always been our moral compass. You reach into the homes, the hearts, and the minds of our people — often where government cannot. Our partnership must continue to strengthen the moral fabric of our country.”
He urged Wantok Radio Light and other Christian broadcasters to keep telling stories of faith, success, and national progress.
“Go out and share the good news of what’s happening in our communities — our young people succeeding, our families growing stronger, our nation moving forward,” Prime Minister Marape said. “Positive stories are the light that overcomes darkness.”
In closing, Prime Minister Marape said Papua New Guinea’s progress depends not only on physical infrastructure, but also on the spiritual and moral foundations of its people.
“We must continue to speak life, hope, and faith into our nation,” he said. “Let us use every radio frequency, every social media channel, and every platform to share messages that unite and build up our people. Together — church, media, and government — we can shape a stronger, God-fearing Papua New Guinea for the next 50 years and beyond.”"
Australia Gov’t support elevates rural women,15/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6460,,Development,Joy,Nill,"On this International Day of Rural Women, the Australian Government recognises and celebrates the important contribution rural women make across Papua New Guinea.
The Australian Government is proud to support Papua New Guinean women through the Lily Magazine Homemade Competition. The Competition has proven to be a platform for ingenuity, empowering rural women to build sustainable businesses using local resources.
Competition finalists receive business development training and an eight-week tailored mentoring program, equipping them with practical knowledge to transform innovative ideas into viable enterprises.
Competition finalists Denise Aitoba and Nicola Boas have expanded their skills and confidence through the program.
Denise Aitoba, a pineapple farmer from Butibam, Morobe Province, is turning thorny pineapple leaves into intricate fibre jewellery. For Denise, who had postponed her business studies to raise a family, the training was a ‘second chance’ to develop her knowledge and skills.
“I didn't know just how much this competition would change my life, especially to go on and attend the business training. It built my confidence,” Denise said.
Her business is now a family affair, engaging her sisters and creating local employment. She has connected with other finalists, including as Nicola Boas, the category winner for the competition's edible category.
Nicola, a forester by profession, is tapping into Papua New Guinea’s rich biodiversity by transforming the vibrant Butterfly Pea flower - lauded for its health benefits - into herbal salts, tea and juice. Nicola shared her inspiration, when she discovered the plant while working in the Markham Valley.
“I was amazed by the blue colour,” Nicola shared. “I believe in the power of integrating these natural 'superfoods' into daily diets.”
Nicola and Denise have now teamed up, joining and inspiring other women in local villages and communities in Morobe to promote their products and offer support to women who want to start small, informal businesses. The competition has fostered a crucial support network, with Denise and Nicola mentoring, celebrating, and supporting each other to expand their customer reach.
Over the past five years, the Australian Government’s investment in the Lily Magazine Homemade Competition has supported women like Denise, Nicola, and many others to launch and grow businesses that harness eco-friendly local resources.
These efforts are contributing to a more inclusive, sustainable future—one powered by the innovation, resilience, and leadership of Papua New Guinea’s rural women."
Kombra addresses exam cheating,15/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6461,,Education,Anger,Nill,"Secretary for Education Dr. Uke Kombra today addressed the media regarding the leakage of examination papers and answer sheets to students before exams.
This follows reports that exam papers and answer sheets were accessed by students of Ivingoi Secondary School in Okapa, Eastern Highlands Province. The school was reported to have committed cheating; however, the department has yet to establish the point of entry for investigation and identify the extent of the leakage.
Secretary Kombra stated that his team is working around the clock to find the extent of the leakage and establish the point of entry.
Cheating in examinations through having access to exam papers and answer sheets before exams is one of the serious academic crimes in PNG, and has come to light since 2012.
Dr. Uke Kombra put this issue as a key task to mitigate.
Secretary Kombra said the entire act of stealing and selling of exam papers is a serious crime and is punishable by law. He said there were instances in the past years where students were reprimanded by the authorities, charged and jailed.
“Students and teachers who are involved in cheating will be terminated on the spot without proper documentation of release,” said Dr Kombra.
He urged parents and students to report any information on the illegal selling of exam papers and sheets in their neighborhood.
While reports circulated on social media, Dr. Kombra stressed that the department is still investigating the Ivingoi incident to pinpoint the source.
Dr. Kombra said his team is working fast to find out how much information was leaked and where the breach started. He warned parents and students not to take part in this illegal activity.
He said students and teachers involved in cheating will be fired immediately.
Dr. Kombra urged parents and students to report any information they have about the illegal sale of exam papers in their communities.
He added that the Ministry of Education is committed to protecting the integrity of the country’s education system and ensuring that learning and exams are not ruined by criminal acts."

"Promoting clean, safe workspaces",13/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6422,,Community,Trust,Nill,"The Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) staff and management took time off from their desks on Tuesday, October 7, to participate in a Cleanathon around the Commission’s office vicinity in Waigani.
The initiative reflects CLRC’s commitment to not only legal reform but also to building a safe, clean, and healthy environment for staff, visitors, and the surrounding community.
While CLRC’s primary mandate is to review and reform Papua New Guinea’s laws, the Commission acknowledges that its role extends beyond legislative work. Corporate social responsibility is an important part of CLRC’s operations, and the Cleanathon serves as a reminder that nation-building begins with small but meaningful actions.
CLRC Secretary Dr. Mange Matui emphasized that the program will be carried out occasionally to ensure the Commission’s workplace remains conducive and welcoming. “A clean and healthy environment is essential not only for productivity but also for the well-being of everyone who interacts with our office. This is our way of giving back to the community, and we intend to make this an occasional practice,” he said.
The Cleanathon is also about teamwork and collective responsibility. Staff from all sections of the Commission worked side by side to clean the office surroundings, demonstrating unity of purpose and the value of shared effort. The activity fostered a sense of pride and ownership among employees, reminding them that maintaining a professional institution begins at home.
Through initiatives such as this, CLRC seeks to promote a culture of cleanliness, wellness, and accountability. It also serves as a visible demonstration of how institutions can contribute to the community in ways that go beyond their mandated functions.
As Papua New Guinea approaches 50 years of nationhood, CLRC believes that embracing both tradition and modern responsibility is essential for progress. Just as law reform strengthens the foundations of democracy, maintaining a clean and healthy environment strengthens the foundation of community and workplace harmony."

“Because they are minors, they (could not) be detained,” Baim said.

Reality check for Kumuls,13/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6426,,Sports,Anticipation,Nill,"Papua New Guinea Prime Minister’s XIII Coach Jason Demetriou expressed confidence in the team's prospects ahead of the Pacific Championships despite losing to the Australian Prime Minister's XIII side on Sunday, October 13.
Coach Demetriou highlighted some positives and lessons that they can take away from the defeat, which they can use as a blueprint for the upcoming internationals and the 2026 Rugby League World Cup.
Commenting on Sunday's loss to Australia, Demetriou was critical of his team’s performance. He said they had a number of opportunities in the first half, but either took the wrong options or were unable to execute better.
“I thought we competed hard for long periods of the game; we probably didn’t take those chances when we had them. I was proud of the first half; we were defending a lot for the first half, but at the start of the second half, we had some chances to put some scores on the Australians. But overall, I am happy with some of the experienced and some of the young players,” said Demetriou.
He commended the team for their resilience and efforts to turn away the Australians on numerous occasions and had to dig deep to score points.
Ahead of the Pacific Championships, Demetriou reveals plans that there will be changes to the team to accommodate big-name players for this week’s line-up.
“The plan is to take some lessons out of this game; there’ll be some quality players coming in. Rhys Martin, who was involved in the Super League grand final, is looking forward to getting back, Lachy Lam and Alex Johnston.”
PNG Kumuls will have a two-week turnaround to prepare for their Bowl title defense against the Cook Islands on October 25 and the Fiji Bati on November 1.
Demetriou is confident that with the right preparation and mindset, the PNG team can compete at a high level and give a strong showing in the upcoming tournaments."
"Marape: Chiefs, a symbol of unity",12/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6412,,Sports,Joy,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape described Papua New Guinea’s National Rugby League team name, Chiefs, as a powerful reflection of the country’s deep cultural roots, ancient governance systems, and unity.
The PM revealed the PNG NRL team name this afternoon at the National Football Stadium (NFS) during the PNG and Australia’s PM’s XIII matches in Port Moresby.
Marape said the PNG Chiefs' name is a fitting emblem as the country celebrates 50 years of Independence in 2025, representing both the past and future of leadership in Papua New Guinea.
“Our forefathers and mothers were chiefs who kept order, peace, and balance among our tribes. As we play on the world stage, the PNG Chiefs will carry that same spirit — the strength of unity in diversity.”
The PNG NRL team, expected to enter the competition in 2028, will be based in Port Moresby but will carry a truly national identity, drawing players from all provinces.
The name Chiefs was chosen through a public poll and professional selection process conducted by Digicel, with more than 20 proposed names submitted for consideration.
“Many creative and culturally meaningful names were put forward, including the one I personally proposed,” he said. “After several rounds of assessment, the shortlist came down to five names — PNG Wantoks, PNG Kundus, PNG Pythons, and PNG Chiefs among them. In the final tally, Chiefs emerged as the most preferred and culturally resonant name, carrying both emotional and rational weight for our people.”
Marape thanked everyone who participated in the national name competition and commended the PNG NRL Bid Board for ensuring a transparent, inclusive, and culturally grounded process.
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the Australian Government and NRL leadership for their partnership in making PNG’s NRL dream a reality.
He thanked Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for his commitment to strengthening people-to-people ties through sports diplomacy and supporting Papua New Guinea’s bid as part of the broader Australia–Pacific sports partnership.
The Prime Minister also recognised Australia Rugby League Commission chairman, Peter V’landys, NRL Chief Executive Officer Andrew Abdo, and the PNG NRL Bid Board for their leadership, understanding, and approval of the PNG Chiefs name.
“The PNG Chiefs will be a unifying symbol of Pacific strength, friendship, and shared values — a reflection of how sport continues to build bridges between peoples and nations.”
He said the PNG Chiefs’ inclusion in the NRL was not only a sporting achievement but also a nation-building milestone, symbolising PNG’s growing partnership with Australia and the Pacific region.
“Our Chiefs will represent the unity and pride of our nation on the world stage.”"
Road Brings Hope Home,12/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6407,,Development,Joy,Nill,"A newly rehabilitated road in the Sepik region has transformed the lives of nearly 1,900 rural families, bringing markets, schools, and hospitals within reach — and turning mud-slicked isolation into mobility, safety, and opportunity.
The 17.63-kilometer Bonohoi–Asanakor road, upgraded by the International Labour Organization (ILO) under the EU-STREIT PNG Programme as part of the European Union’s Global Gateway Strategy, has become a vital lifeline for communities in the Ambunti–Drekikier and Maprik Districts.
Before the upgrade, the road was a muddy trail where women in labour were carried on stretchers, students missed class, and farmers struggled to haul heavy cocoa bags through clay slopes. Today, the story is different.
“I’m very happy with the EU-STREIT Programme for coming into my area in Bumbita,” says local farmer and father of six, Ricky Raikos Kamba. “Now, vehicles pick us up straight at our doorsteps with our cocoa, coffee and other garden produce.”
The impact is widespread. Where only a few vehicles once dared to travel, up to 20 now make daily trips — many owned by locals. Transport costs have dropped by more than half, making it easier for farmers to send cocoa and coffee to market and return with essential goods. “Before, we used to walk two hours to the main road,” says Ricky. “Now it’s just 30 to 40 minutes by PMV.”
For women like Celina Benny, the change has brought peace of mind. “When the road condition was bad, it was very hard for us mothers,” she recalls. “Now, we can call for transport assistance, or vehicles in the village can assist us easily to the health centre.”
Students and teachers are also benefiting. At Urita Primary School, teacher Kuti Wambuan says materials and supplies now arrive directly at the campus, and attendance has improved. “Students walk easily to the school,” he says.
Beyond transport, the road has enabled families to buy and deliver water tanks, access health care faster, and boost local trade. As part of the broader EU-STREIT PNG Programme, the project complements ongoing efforts to strengthen the cocoa, vanilla, and fisheries value chains, creating lasting economic and social transformation.
Ricky sums it up best: “Before, we waited for PMVs on the main road. Now, they stop at our doorstep. The road has brought life closer to us.”"
Rare Conjoined Twins Born in Finschhafen,12/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6405,,Health,Surprise,Nill,"In a rare medical event for Papua New Guinea, conjoined twin boys were born at the small, remote Braun Hospital in Finschhafen two days ago.
The hospital's staff, despite having few resources, managed to keep the newborn boys stable. Soon after, a special medical flight team from Manolos Aviation quickly flew the babies to Lae for better medical attention.
The twins are joined at the lower part of their bodies and share some internal organs. However, they have separate arms, legs, and genitals.
The mother, Fatima Kevin from Finschhafen, said that doctors knew she was carrying two babies because they detected two heartbeats during her pregnancy.
However, the rare condition of the twins being joined was only found during the birth.
Braun Hospital is run by the Lutheran Church and is well-known for struggling with money, but it continues to serve the local rural community.
The mother and her babies are now at Angau Memorial Hospital in Lae, where they are receiving specialised care.
Hospital staff said that after more tests, the twins might be sent overseas for operation to separate them.
Conjoined twins are uncommon in Papua New Guinea, with only a small number of cases reported over the last few decades."

Representing the Northern Governor at the handover, Ijivitari MP David Arore thanked the SEOC Committee, the Northern Provincial Education Division, teachers, and students for making the 34th SEOC a success.
“The conference has brought great benefits to Northern Province, not only in education but also economically, with local businesses, craft markets, and SMEs earning valuable income from visiting participants,” Arore said.
The Senior Education Officers Conference is a key annual event of the Department of Education, serving as a platform for policy development, strategic planning, and strengthening communication from the national to the local level of government.
The 34th SEOC brought together Provincial Education Advisors, planners, and senior officers from across the country to discuss challenges, review progress, and develop pathways aligned with the National Education Plan 2020–2029. This year the Southern region played host to the event, with Northern Province successfully staging the 34th SEOC in Popondetta."
PNGEA Strategy Launched,11/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6393,,Environment,Anticipation,Nill,"The Papua New Guinea Environment Alliance (PNGEA) has officially launched its Strategy 2025–2027, signed a landmark Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Expertise France, and hosted a pivotal Civil Society Dialogue in preparation for COP30 in Brazil.
The two-day event from October 8-9, held during EU Green Diplomacy Week 2025, marks a major milestone for environmental civil society in PNG. Backed by the European Union-funded Forestry-Climate Change-Biodiversity (EU-FCCB) Programme, the Strategy sets out five ambitious goals to elevate environmental advocacy and action:
•	Sharing leading practices on sustainable development.
•	Influencing policy and governance at national and international levels.
•	Professionalising PNG’s environmental workforce.
•	Strengthening member institutions.
•	Building robust systems, partnerships, and digital platforms.
PNGEA, a coalition of 12 environmental NGOs and CSOs, aims to amplify the voice of Papua New Guinean communities in climate negotiations. The Strategy builds on its founding work since 2019 and positions civil society as a key player in shaping climate and biodiversity policy.
The MoU signed with Expertise France will provide PNGEA with strategic support in communications, IT, digitalisation, and organisational development—critical areas for implementing the new Strategy and ensuring long-term sustainability.
“This Strategy positions PNGEA and civil society organisations as critical partners in advancing inclusive climate action. Today’s Dialogue ensures that the voices of PNG’s communities are heard on the global stage at COP30,” said Pamela Avusi, PNGEA Coordinator.
Alaric Vandenberghe, Project Manager of the EU-FCCB Programme, added, “Strong partnerships between civil society, government, and development partners can deliver meaningful climate action. Ensuring that local communities and indigenous peoples are part of the conversation is essential to building resilience and driving real impact.”
The Civil Society Dialogue focused on three key advocacy areas for COP30:
•	Climate finance: Access and transparency for frontline communities.
•	Community and indigenous rights: Protection of land, culture, and traditional knowledge.
•	Local adaptation strategies: Scaling community-led resilience and innovation.
The outcomes will shape PNGEA’s advocacy agenda for COP30 and beyond, ensuring that Papua New Guinea’s environmental priorities are represented in global climate policy."
Supreme Court dismisses Niningi application on Connect PNG,10/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6386,,Politics,Disgust,"Douglas Tomuriesa, Pila Niningi","The seven-men bench of the Supreme Court has dismissed an application filed by Minister for Justice Pila Niningi seeking to dismiss the special reference application filed by Opposition Leader Douglas Tomuriesa challenging the legality of the Connect PNG programme funds.
Justice George Manuhu, Justice David Cannings, Justice Derek Hartshorn, Justice Joseph Yagi, Justice Collin Makail, Justice Ere Kariko, and Justice Peter Toliken dismissed the application for being an abuse of process.
On October 28 2024, the Leader of the Opposition was by consent declared to have standing to pursue the special reference application under section 18(1) of the Constitution. The first intervener, Minister for Justice Pila Niningi, then moved his objection to the competency of the Application, which was dismissed as incompetent for not being filed within the time limit prescribed by the Supreme Court Rules.
Niningi then filed another dismissal application on November 5 2024, principally under section 13 rule 16 of the Supreme Court Rules, seeking to summarily dismiss the application as being an abuse of process as it does not raise questions of interpretation or application of a constitutional law as required under section 18(1).
However, the court found that the grounds upon which the Attorney General seeks summary dismissal are matters concerning the merits of the Application, it may be argued at the substantive hearing of the Application, and that the Dismissal Application itself constitutes an abuse of process.
The substantive hearing of the Opposition Leader’s application will be heard at a later date.
Tomuriesa filed the application on June 4 2024, pursuant to section 18 of the Constitution, questioning the legality of the government's Connect PNG Programme. Among clarifications sought is the payment of nearly K2 billion for the road programme for April 2021 to January this year.
The main issue raised in the reference was the payments made by the Department of Works and National Highways to certain service providers for the funding and implementation of the Connect PNG Programme, which were not made in accordance with the mandatory statutory basis for the implementation and funding of the connect PNG programme."
Former Telikom staff want full entitlement,10/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6381,,Business,Anger,Nill,"Over 200 long-serving employees of Telikom PNG were retired and retrenched as part of the company’s restructure exercise.
The affected former staff have demanded an explanation of how entitlements were processed because they believe they have been unfairly compensated.
They demanded that management firstly explain the removal of long-serving staff, most of whom are still below the retirement age of 65.
Former employee Yowane Kewanu said, “The CEO made this announcement on September 12th during our pre-independence celebrations. He mentioned that there will be only 100 or fewer people at the age of 55 and above, but those willing to go may do so.  After a few weeks, they gave us notice to leave, under what terms and conditions, we did not know,” Kewanu said.
Another employee, Mary Wak said she and her colleagues were handed retirement and retrenchment letters to sign on September 26, 2025. She claims there was no consultation with management, no dialogue with Human Resource and no prior notice.
“There was no consultation with us, no HR consultation telling us that we are going, and we have to prepare for it,” she said.
Wak said many long-serving employees with 30 to 45 years of service were paid between K2,000 and K50,000 in leave entitlements.
“They gave us rec leave and fellow leave only, some got K40,000 some got K20,000, K5,000 some got K3,000, and that was a nightmare for many of us,” she said.
After signing their letters, the aggrieved former staff submitted a petition to Telikom PNG management, giving it 48 hours to explain the process used in paying the entitlements.
The petition expired on Wednesday, October 8, 2025, with no response from the Telikom management, prompting them to raise their grievances through the media in a quest to seek answers.
Telikom CEO Amos Tepi in a media release stated 	that the merger of Telikom and bemobile has led to a restructure, resulting in the retirement and retrenchment of staff and is part of the second Phase of this transition process.
Tepi stated that the retrenchment exercise was approved under NEC Decision No. 38 of 2019. The statement also claims that each affected employee had a one-on-one meeting with Human Resource prior, and that management conducted town hall meetings with staff over the past three years about the restructure program - the most recent being September 12, 2025. The second phase of that exercise was implemented 14 days later."
PNGUoT celebrates new dining hall,10/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6388,,Education,Joy,Nill,"The Papua New Guinea University of Technology in Lae today officially opened its new state-of-the-art dining hall, valued at approximately K30 million.
The construction of the dining hall, which started in April 2021, came to a halt following in-house issues with the initial contractor. The university stepped in and salvaged the situation, with vice chancellor, Professor Ora Renagi, describing their journey as one of “perseverance, unity and triumph”.
The National Executive Council allocated K20 million under its Public Investment Program to begin the construction of a new dining hall for PNGUoT.
Out of the six companies that had bid for the project, the NEC awarded the contract to Regional Engineering and Construction Ltd based on monetary and capability criteria, following points awarded by the National Procurement Commission and PNGUoT senior management.
Construction started in April 2021 but soon came to a halt in 2022 due to financial incapabilities.
“It has been a long journey; one filled with delays, obstacles and court challenges but it is also a journey of perseverance, unity and triumph,” said an emotional vice chancellor, Professor Ora Renagi.
“What we are witnessing today isn’t just the opening of a building; it is the fulfilment of a long-awaited dream – a symbol of resilience for the entire Unitech community.”
In 2022, the university was forced to terminate the contract with REC, and allocated an additional K10 million to rescope and complete the project.
Prof Renagi commended the university council for consulting independent experts to determine additional costs needed, as well as the project office for ensuring that construction was as per schedule.
The completed infrastructure can cater to 2,000 people, and is being used by students and the institution for big events, such as the 6th Pacific Islands Universities Regional Network conference that was hosted in July this year.
The well-ventilated, spacious dining facility replaces the one that was burnt down by students during a violent protest in June 26, 2016."

Fourth CMCA Signed With Increased Benefits,9/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6366,,Business,Trust,"Agena Gamai, James Donald, James Marape, Rainbo Paita, Taboi Awi Yoto, William Duma","Ok Tedi Mining Limited (Ok Tedi) successfully signed the fourth Community Mine Continuation Agreement (CMCA) with the impacted communities of Western Province yesterday in Port Moresby.
The agreement contains new and improved terms, reinforcing Ok Tedi’s commitment to the communities there.
The 4th CMCA delivers the largest increase in benefits in the agreement’s history – up to 80 percent increase across the board, with some regions having more than 100 percent increases on their current CMCA compensation package. These benefits are not only larger in scale but broader in scope.
The 4th CMCA introduces three new components:
• Youth Development Programs to empower future generations.
• Short-Term Investment Opportunities to promote economic sustainability.
• Impact Projects Agreement to address the social development gaps.
“These additions reflect our belief that the future of our communities lies not only in mining, but in education, entrepreneurship, and resilience,” said Ok Tedi Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Kedi Ilimbit, when speaking at the ceremony on Tuesday 7th October.
Mr Ilimbit acknowledged the presence of Prime Minister Hon. James Marape, State Owned Enterprise Minister William Duma, Mining Minister Rainbo Paita, Minister for Livestock and Member for South Fly Seki Agisa, Deputy Opposition Leader and Member for North Fly James Donald, Western Provincial Governor Taboi Awi Yoto, Member for Delta Fly Agena Gamai and members of the Fly River Provincial Government administration.
Also in attendance were the landowner leaders, and community representatives, statutory agencies and government departments; all of whom were involved in celebrating this momentous achievement built on over a year of inclusive dialogue and negotiation.
The signing ceremony was witnessed by the Board and Management of Kumul Minerals Holdings, the Mineral Resources Development Company Management, Mineral Resources Authority Managing Director Jerry Garry, PNG Sustainable Development Program Limited management, Department of Mineral Policy and Geohazards Secretary Harry Kore and his team, and National Energy Authority Managing Director Ronald Maketa.
“This agreement is the result of a rigorous dialogue process grounded in Free, Prior and Informed Consent,” said Mr Ilimbit. “Every village had the opportunity to engage, ask questions, and make informed decisions with the support of independent legal advisors. It has been a long journey, lasting 19 months but one that reflects our shared values of transparency and respect.”
Speaking at the signing ceremony, mine villages and CMCA leaders, women and youth representatives also commended Ok Tedi for the improvements to the CMCA benefits package and the willingness to work with them to achieve an outcome favourable to all parties.
Since the inception of CMCA in 2001, the Agreement has ensured that the 152 CMCA villages and six mine villages have a direct voice and stake in the mine’s operations. Today, these communities are not only beneficiaries but shareholders, owning 21 percent of shares in Ok Tedi through Mineral Resources CMCA Holdings and Minerals Resources Star Mountain. The remaining 12% of the 33% total shareholding by Western Province is held by the Fly River Provincial Government.
“As we honour PNG’s 50th Independence Anniversary, Ok Tedi remains proud as a pillar of nation-building. We are not just a mining company – we are a company owned by Papua New Guineans, serving Papua New Guineans, and building Papua New Guinea,” said Mr Ilimbit. “Our legacy is measured not just in ounces of gold or tonnes of copper, but in the schools, health posts, infrastructure, and and sustainable livelihoods that will remain long after the mine closes.”
Mr Ilimbit concluded: “To our landowners: thank you for your trust, patience, and partnership. Ok Tedi belongs to all of us, and together, we will continue to make it a source of pride for Papua New Guinea.”"
Late Wenge’s body returns home for burial,9/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6375,,Politics,Sadness,"John Rosso, Luther Wenge","The body of late Morobe Governor, Luther Akisawa Wenge was formally returned to his family and people in Baindoang today, where he will be laid to rest among his ancestors.
Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso, acting as the nation's chief mourner, officially handed over the casket to Mr. Wenge's tribesmen. The handover was witnessed by family members, political colleagues, and citizens from across Morobe Province.
Luther Wenge was widely known for his deep commitment to both faith and justice. He was raised in a missionary family - his father helped spread the Lutheran faith throughout Morobe, a background that greatly influenced his strong character and leadership.
His journey into public service began early. He showed leadership as a school captain at Dregerhafen High School and went on to study law at the University of Papua New Guinea. Before entering politics, he achieved a distinguished legal career, serving as a respected National Court judge.
As Governor, Mr. Wenge earned a reputation as a bold and visionary politician. He was a staunch defender of Papua New Guinea's Constitution, often challenging decisions he felt were unfair or went against the interests of ordinary citizens.
His Lutheran faith was the cornerstone of his governance, promoting a philosophy focused on service, compassion, and equality for all people under the law. Drawing on his own rural roots, he championed better services for remote areas, prioritizing universal education, rural health, and fair development across the nation.
In a final tribute, DPM Rosso thanked the people of Nabak and Nawaeb for sharing Mr. Wenge’s leadership with the rest of Papua New Guinea. He described the late Governor as a ""giant"" of Morobe politics whose legacy will continue to inspire the nation."

He added that the government is pushing for increased arbitration and mediation to strengthen legal avenues, protect the nation, and safeguard the future of the children."
Understanding Reached to Complete Key Reviews,8/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6352,,Business,Trust,Ian Ling-Stuckey,"The International Monetary Fund and the Government of Papua New Guinea have reached a staff-level agreement on policies needed to complete the fifth review of the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangements and the second review of the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) arrangement.
Upon approval by the IMF Executive Board, the completion of these reviews would allow for the immediate disbursement of SDR121.07 million (K694.52m) under the ECF-EFF arrangements and SDR39.48 million (K226.47m) in financing under the RSF arrangement.
This would bring the total IMF financial support disbursed thus far under these arrangements to SDR622.48 million (K3.57b).
“The IMF will continue to work closely with the authorities and stands ready to help them, not only through financing and policy advice, but also through capacity development, coordinated with other partners.
IMF mission chief for Papua New Guinea, Nir Klein said the IMF team is grateful to the authorities for their warm hospitality, productive collaboration, and open policy dialogue.
“Performance under the Fund-supported programs has been satisfactory. The authorities have also made steady progress in implementing their structural reform agenda and demonstrated strong commitment to program objectives.
“All, but one, quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets set for end-June 2025 were met, and most structural benchmarks due by end-September 2025 were implemented.
“Two RSF reform measures scheduled for this review are on track to be implemented in the coming weeks,” Mr Klein said.
“These reforms have yielded notable results thus far, including:
i)	a sharp reduction of the fiscal deficit, helping to alleviate public debt vulnerabilities,
ii)	improved access to FX and mopping of a significant part of excess liquidity,
iii)	establishment of an operational anti-corruption framework, and
iv)	easier access to data on natural disasters to support a climate-conscious decision-making.”
The IMF team met with Minister for Treasury Ian Ling-Stuckey, Governor of BPNG Elizabeth Genia, Secretary of Treasury Andrew Oaeke, Deputy Governor of BPNG, Jefferey Yabom, and other senior government officials.
The team also had constructive meetings with representatives from the private sector and development partners."
From Battlefield to Bonding,8/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6359,,International,Trust,James Marape,"What was once a battleground has become a bridge - in October 2023, the newly inaugurated Nadzab Tomodachi International Airport opened near Lae, redefining ties between Papua New Guinea and Japan. The airport’s name, “Tomodachi” meaning “friend” in Japanese  is a deliberate tribute to reconciliation, peace, and shared progress.
The project was supported by Japan through its Official Development Assistance (ODA) mechanism and executed via the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The program included a new passenger terminal, runway and taxiway upgrades, and renovations of control and fire towers.
Prime Minister James Marape, speaking at the 50th anniversary of Japan’s ODA to PNG in October 2024, called Japan a “sincere and genuine friend,” recognizing decades of development collaboration. The airport’s naming was his suggestion, intended to anchor the relationship in symbolism as much as infrastructure.

The site of Nadzab is itself steeped in history. In 1943, during World War II, fierce battles raged there; over 150,000 Japanese soldiers perished in what became known to Japan as the “Place of No Return.” Allied forces captured the area in an airborne operation, turning it into a strategic base known as NADZAB (Northern Australian Defence Zone Air Base).
Today, Nadzab stands as a potent symbol of reconciliation. The airport is strategically important — it fosters trade, tourism, emergency logistics, and deepens bilateral trust. Japan has similarly backed upgrades at Jacksons International Airport in Port Moresby and Tokua Airport in East New Britain, strengthening PNG’s overall aviation infrastructure.
PNG is a critical partner for Japan in resource supply. It ranks among Japan’s top import sources within the Pacific, providing LNG, crude oil, minerals, timber, and agricultural products. Japanese investments and trade interest depend in part on reliable infrastructure and logistics.

The friendship has proven responsive beyond economics. Following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, PNGers and the government raised 10 million kina in aid for Japan — a remarkable showing given the socioeconomic challenges many PNG households face.
PNG has achieved major milestones — its 50th anniversary of independence and 50 years of diplomatic relations with Japan in 2025 — the two nations find themselves looking ahead together. The Nadzab Tomodachi Airport is not just a transport hub, but a living monument to what bonds—once forged in conflict—can become."
PNG’s economic outlook remains positive: IMF,8/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6355,,Business,Trust,Nill,"PNG’s economic outlook remains positive with growth expected to increase to 4.5 percent in 2025 from an estimated 3.8 percent in 2024, supported by increased production of Porgera gold mine, continued improvement in access to foreign exchange (FX), and favorable agriculture production.
According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Report, an average headline inflation is projected to rebound to 3.8 percent in 2025 from a historical low of 0.6 percent in 2024 as the drag from betel nut prices eases, while core inflation, which excludes selected volatile items, is projected to edge up to 3.3 percent in 2025, staying below the historical average.
IMF mission chief for Papua New Guinea, Nir Klein reaffirmed that the gross international reserves, which stood at US$3.6 billion (K15.11b) at end-July 2025 (equivalent to about five months of imports of goods and services), are expected to remain adequate and support the crawl-like exchange rate arrangement.
“The government remains committed to an ambitious fiscal consolidation strategy in line with its 13-year budget repair plan. Having reduced the fiscal deficit by 1.1 percentage point of GDP in 2024, the authorities are on track to deliver a reduction of at least 0.6 percentage point of GDP in 2025, through both revenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization,” Mr Klein said.
He said the authorities plan to further reduce the deficit in the upcoming 2026 budget, consistent with their objective of reaching a balanced budget in 2027 and are committed to implement a prudent borrowing strategy aimed at reducing public debt vulnerabilities.
The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) has continued to actively implement its roadmap of reforms to help alleviate FX shortages, gradually return to Kina convertibility, and modernize its monetary policy operations.
IMF reported that access to FX has improved significantly in 2025, supported by the implementation of the crawl-like arrangement, BPNG’s FX intervention strategy, and favorable commodity prices, which have contributed to buoyant export proceeds.
The Monetary Policy Committee’s decision to increase the Kina Facility Rate in September 2025 is a welcome step to ensure consistency with the exchange rate arrangement while the continued reduction of the Cash Reserve Requirement ratio will help ease liquidity conditions in the banking system.
According to the IMF, to improve monetary policy transmission and facilitate a more active interbank market, the BPNG continues to build up the critical operational and legal frameworks and enhance its liquidity management and emergency lending toolkit."

Two schools, including Jubilee Catholic Secondary and Marianville Secondary, completed an 11-week transformation table, graduated and are certified facilitators.
Other schools, including Del La Salle Secondary, Waigani Christian College, Ororo Junior High, Bavaroko Junior High, and Tokarara Junior High School, have started on the transformation table.
Tribal Foundation President GT Bustin said Senisim PNG program is more than awareness; it is about transformation.
“We want to inspire individuals to shift their mindset, embrace leadership, and take action for the betterment of their communities,” Bustin said.
Senisim PNG National Coordinator Phillie Marai said there are four other programs under Tribal Foundation that is still under development and will be rolled out to schools targeting primary schools, elementary, and early childhood learning in the future."
Mining wealth not reaching people: Marape,8/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6361,,Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has expressed his pride in the people of Western Province but acknowledged the poor human development indicators despite the Ok Tedi mine's operations.
Speaking at the closing ceremony of the CMCA workshop in Port Moresby last night, the Prime Minister challenged stakeholders to assess the sustainability of wealth transfer since the 2001 social license was granted.
He revealed that as Finance Minister in 2012, he had refused attempts to change the trust structure for CMCA funds, which then stood at almost K700 million.
""The government is committed to saving for the next generation,"" the Prime Minister stressed, citing an example where the National Government is currently holding or transferring over K300 million to partners for projects designed to create ""intergenerational wealth that stays forever.""
Meantime, the Prime Minister confirmed a significant increase in the benefits package, which he urged Ok Tedi Mining Limited (OTML) and Kumul Minerals Holdings Limited (KMHL) to formalise.
Key details of the forthcoming agreement include:
•	Increased Equity Rates: The MoA to be taken to Cabinet next week will include ""increased equity rates"" for the CMCA people.
•	Tax Credit Scheme Boost: The current 2% rate going to the Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme (TCS) will be increased to 3%.
Marape insisted that the 12th CMCA must be a ""transformational"" agreement, not just a contractual one.
He noted that with an estimated population of only 300,000 people, the proper planning of this single mine's proceeds could lead to the complete betterment of Western Province.
He concluded by assuring the people that the final agreement will be one that ""respects the people, improves lives, and aligns with national policy to ensure Western Province is developed better for all."""
CLRC officers challenged to drive change,8/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6356,,Government,Trust,Nill,"The Secretary of the Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC), Dr. Mange Matui has challenged three senior officers, who have recently achieved significant academic milestones, to utilize their skills in the interest of the Commission and the country as a whole.
Secretary Matui made this statement during a congratulatory luncheon program to honour Principal Legal Officer Biteng Narewec for obtaining his Master of Laws in Constitutional and Administrative Law from Parul University in India; Manager Administration, Bill Katu for completing his Bachelor of Business Management at the University of Papua New Guinea, and Executive Assistant to Deputy Secretary for Legislative Reform, Winnie Haroro for attaining her Diploma in Business Management from the Somare Institute of Leadership and Governance.
These milestone achievements reflect CLRC’s commitment to fostering professional growth and ensuring its officers are equipped with the right knowledge and skills to strengthen the Commission’s core mandate in law review and reform.
Dr. Matui reminded the officers of their obligation to the Commission, “You are morally obliged to serve this institution, because we see the potential in you, we see that you can contribute to CLRC in the long run, that’s why we invested in you,” he said.
He added, “The future of the organization depends on qualified people, and young people to come onboard and drive this organization going forward, that’s why it is imperative we invest in this area.”

"Pukpuk Treaty A PNG-Initiated Move, Not an Australian Imposition",8/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6349,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"The signing of the Pukpuk Treaty on Monday fuelled debate, some saying PNG was lured to enter into this agreement by Australia when it granted PNG a team to play in NRL, while others pointing out implications of this treaty on PNG’s sovereignty as a nation.
Marape clarified that Australia never requested PNG to enter into this treaty – instead PNG reached out to Australia as part of its 50th reset agenda.
Prime Minister James Marape in a media conference on Monday evening, put these claims to rest, highlighting the need to rebuild and strengthen the capacity of PNG Defence Force.
“And I want to put it to Papua New Guinea right from the outset.
Australia never requested this. We were pretty content with living and working in the Defence Cooperation Agreement that we've had with them. We've had the security forces moving in and out, working in partnership with PNG Defence Force, the current naval base refit and restoration happening in Manus, etc.
But we reached out to them as part of our 50th reset, and especially from PNG's interest to resuscitate, rebuild, re-strengthen our Defence Force at the earliest,“ he explained
The Prime Minister further pointed out PNG’s inability to defend its shores in the event of an attack and how PNG can rely on treaties like this to access help.
“I want to inform Papua New Guinea, my people, right now as we speak, if someone chooses to invade, God forbid, and we have no enemies right now, and I qualify this, but on a hypothetical situation, if someone chooses to invade PNG right now, as your Prime Minister, or Minister Billy, as your Defence Minister, or your Defence Commander, has no ability whatsoever to defend our country on air, on sea, technology, or on land. Four areas, on air, sea, land, or through technology.
“My number one job as your Prime Minister is your security man. It's my responsibility to look at the security apparatus we have. Domestic security, internal security, external security, the threats that we pose within, and possibility of the defence of our sovereignty going forward.
“Today, our country, our 3 million square kilometres of sea borders, our 462,840 square kilometres of land space, the vulnerabilities, the exposures we have compels us, by a stroke of a pen, to have access to a world-class security capability and capacity.”
He further clarified that the signing of this treaty does not give Australia the right to tamper with PNG’s sovereignty. It can only act when asked to.
“What this one technically means in Papua New Guinea is expose some place. Then Australia's capacity is there for us to lean on. We've signed this agreement, but it doesn't give automatic Australia intervention in our country.”
Meantime, in consistent with Section 117 of the Constitution, the treaty will now be brought to parliament for ratification.
Ratification will signify the formal consent to be bound by the treaty's provisions."

EU-FCCB Celebrates Green Diplomacy Week with Students and Civil Society,7/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6335,,Environment,Trust,Nill,"The EU–Forestry, Climate Change and Biodiversity (EU-FCCB) programme met with university students, civil society, and media representatives to celebrate EU Green Diplomacy Week at the Moresby Arts Theatre from October 6–10, featuring 40 university student scholars.
The European Union Green Diplomacy Week, which focuses on forestry, climate change, and biodiversity, is an annual event hosted by EU offices around the world around this time each year. It serves as a lead-up to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP30, which will take place in Brazil from November 10–21, 2025.
The European Union remains determined to ensure the success of the global green transition.
EU Deputy Head of Mission and Head of the Political, Press and Information Section, Stephanie Vadde’, said achieving the targets set by the Paris Agreement after 10 years has been a long and difficult journey, but progress is being made.
“It’ a moment where we want to really bring together youth, civil society, media, government agencies celebrating or marking 10 years of Paris Agreement. We’ve set momentum, it’s still a long way but …. lots of engagement from both sides,” Vadde said.
Acting Managing Director for the Climate Change and Development Authority (CCDA), Debra Sungi, acknowledged the EU-FCCB programme for its continued assistance in advancing Papua New Guinea’s climate change agenda.
“The EU’s long-standing support has enabled CCDA and the government and our partner agencies to turn policies into real practical actions, empowering our provincial government, our civil society, and the communities to really take ownership of climate’s options that aligned with PNGs nationally determined contribution and our long-term initial strategies. This green diplomacy week reminds us that diplomacy is not only a government-to-government dialogue, but it is really about our shared action and it is also inspiring to see our youths, young leaders, our entrepreneurs and our scientists as well coming together to contribute to just, inclusive and climate resilient and I would like to go back to last week when we had our Climate Change Summit. It was an interesting platform where we have actually seen young people from primary level coming in very innovative minds in terms of identifying climate problems and what their solutions are,” Sungi said.
Alaric Vandenberghe, Project Manager of the EU-FCCB Programme, National Component under the Expertise France Group, explained the purpose of the programme.
“We have different interventions but one of the ones we are extremely happy to roll out is the Masters Scholarship Scheme and so this is part of our support to post-graduate towards education and research. And so we are offering 20 scholarships in the FCCB space this year,” said Vandenberghe.
The programme is now calling for another 20 applicants for the Masters Scholarships, as there are currently not many people with postgraduate qualifications in this discipline. The scholarships are fully funded, valued at K10 million, and support both research and education."

""Please, make use of what you have learned during the two weeks training,"" Niningi said.
He thanked PNGTPA and SMEC for training his people and imparting the most important knowledge required on how to start their businesses.

Dr Billy welcomes Defence Treaty,7/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6346,,Politics,Trust,"Billy Joseph, James Marape","Minister for Defence, Dr Billy Joseph has commended the visionary leadership of Prime Minister James Marape for signing the Security (PukPuk) Treaty with Australia on Monday in Canberra, Australia.
Dr Billy in a statement described the Treaty as a landmark bilateral defence agreement designed to protect and strengthen Papua New Guinea’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity through mutual defence cooperation, modernisation of the PNG Defence Force (PNGDF), and significant socio-economic benefits for the people of Papua New Guinea.
“Prime Minister, I congratulate you on signing this critical mutual defence treaty today in Canberra. It is the correct, forward-thinking decision taken at exactly the right time,” said Dr. Billy.
Dr Billy emphasised that this treaty reflects maturity in bilateral relations and a shared vision for regional stability.
“We must not dwell in the past, especially on past decisions by either government. As we mark our 50th Independence Anniversary and look to construct the next 50 years, national security must be at the core of that construct. The PukPuk Treaty is the foundation of that outcome,” he said.
The Minister further reaffirmed that the treaty is fully compliant with the Constitution of Papua New Guinea and does not require any constitutional amendment for its implementation.
He further explained that under the treaty, PNG citizens recruited into the Australian Defence Force (ADF) will not be members of the PNGDF.
“They will hold dual citizenship and may attain Australian citizenship within nine weeks of recruitment.
“A similar opportunity will apply to Australian citizens wishing to serve in the PNGDF. While PNGDF and ADF personnel will train and operate together to improve interoperability, the Commander of the PNGDF retains full command and control of his forces within PNG’s jurisdiction.
“Likewise, the Commander of the ADF maintains authority over Australian troops,” the Minister clarified.
This, Dr Billy said will ensure that the mandate of the PNGDF under Section 202 remains fully protected."

New Forestry plantation extension program launched,7/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6341,,Environment,Trust,Sam Basil,"The PNG Forest Authority (PNGFA) has called on landowners throughout the country to partner with the authority and plant more trees under the government’s ‘Painim Graun - Planim Diwai’ (Find Land - Plant trees) program.
PNGFA managing director John Mosoro made the call when addressing foresters, landowners, and the community during the launch of the Bulolo-Wau New Forestry Plantation Extension Program on Thursday, October 1. The launch concluded PNGFA’s 50th independence anniversary celebrations.
According to PNGFA, a total of 12,500 hectares of trees have been planted and sustained at the Bulolo Wau Forestry plantations. These trees at the plantations are then harvested by PNG Forest Products to process and produce plywood, sawn timber, and veneer products.
Mosoro said a target of 800,000 hectares of land is needed to plant trees and commended landowners of Bulolo and Watut for agreeing to participate in the government forestry reforestation program.
He said the program will be a win-win solution for all forest stakeholders.
“It will promote tree planting and reforestation, and carbon trade, as PNG forests are globally known to be the last tracts of pristine rainforests in the world and the lungs of Mother Earth,” added Mosoro.
He appealed to landowners to participate in the program, which will provide them with greater benefits through equity participation.
Meantime, PNGFA and the Bulolo landowners will soon sign an agreement for the landowners to take up equity shares in the project, which will be operated by PNGFA's business arm - PNG Diwai Holdings Limited.
Mosoro stressed that the forestry sector is an important sector that is renewable and sustainable and will sustain itself in the future, unlike oil, gas, and gold resources, which will be gone.
“That is why forestry is a God given value to us. We are managing forests that God has created to sustain our lives on earth. Forests are the lungs of the earth. If we make the wrong policies, we will end up destroying our planet,” Mosoro said.
Member for Bulolo Sam Basil Jnr was also a guest speaker at the launch. He commended PNGFA for its support of the Bulolo community and town.
“We call this a town because of you, PNGFA. Let me represent my people and acknowledge the work of the government under this plantation program and associated activities.
“Forestry has created employment and income for our people. Although we do have social and land issues and would like to call for a review of the initial agreement,” MP Basil said.
PNGFA has agreed to review the Bulolo plantation agreement."

Secretary for Education, Dr Uke Kombra, said the Department is being informed of the situation and is working closely with the West New Britain Provincial Education Office and the school to ensure the affected students are given the opportunity to complete their examinations.
“We have been advised by the Provincial Education Advisor that a formal letter will be issued to the school to allow the students to sit for their examinations starting tomorrow, Tuesday, October 7, 2025.
They will also be required to complete a Notice of Absenteeism form to account for the paper they missed today,” Dr. Kombra said.
He explained that Kimbe Grammar School is a private institution and operates under its own administrative and financial policies, separate from government-run schools.
“Private schools manage their own affairs, including staff salaries and fee structures. Students who enroll in private institutions do so under the terms and conditions set by the school,” Dr. Kombra stated.
Despite this, Dr Kombra emphasized that no child should be denied the right to education or participation in national assessments due to circumstances beyond their control.
“Education is a right for every child in Papua New Guinea, whether in the public or private system.
While private schools have their own governance structures, we continue to advocate for inclusive and fair practices that prioritize the welfare and learning continuity of all students,” he said.
Dr Kombra further appealed to school administrations, parents, and provincial authorities to collaborate and resolve such matters amicably to avoid disruption to students’ learning and examinations.
“We want every eligible student to complete their education successfully.

Minister for Environment, Conservation and Climate Change, Simo Kilepa, affirmed PNG’s commitment to stand with Australia during the recent Pacific Climate Change Ministers Meeting, in Sydney, held from October 2–3.
He said PNG was pleased to participate in the Pacific Climate Change Ministers Meeting to reaffirm the Pacific solidarity and the strength of their collective voice as frontline nations of the climate crisis.
Minister Kilepa stated that the Pacific continues to face the harsh realities of climate change, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and the loss of ecosystems and livelihoods.
“In response, we are united in calling for urgent and ambitious global action. At this meeting, Pacific Island countries unanimously agreed to support Australia’s bid to host the COP31. in partnership with the Pacific, this bid, currently contested between Australia and Turkey, represents a crucial opportunity for the world to come to the Pacific and witness firsthand the realities of the climate emergency,” said Minister Kilepa.

IRC directed to review mining companies’ taxes,6/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6328,,Business,Anticipation,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has directed the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) to conduct a comprehensive review of all mining companies operating in Papua New Guinea to ensure they are paying their fair share of taxes amid record global commodity prices.
This follows the announcement by New Porgera Limited that it has paid over K500 million in corporate tax for the first two quarters of 2025 - a milestone he described as commendable and exemplary.
“If Porgera, operating in a very remote and challenging environment, can pay over K500 million in tax within just six months, it raises a legitimate question - are all our other mining companies paying their fair share?” Marape said.
“In this day and age where gold, copper, nickel, iron, and silver prices are at their highest, Papua New Guinea expects proportional returns from the resource companies operating here.”
The Prime Minister has tasked the IRC to immediately review the taxation compliance of all mining operations, comparing production levels, operational costs, and taxes paid, and to provide a detailed report to the National Government.
“I am asking the IRC Commissioner to check the books and give me a report on all mining companies - who is paying what, and whether those payments reflect current high commodity prices,” he said.
“Those companies that are paying their fair share, I say thank you. But we must ensure that everyone contributes equitably to our nation’s revenue base.”
The Prime Minister emphasised that ensuring tax compliance across the sector is crucial to PNG’s broader economic reform goals.
“I have made it no secret that once our economy reaches the K200 billion threshold, my government will review and consider cutting taxes for our people and businesses,” he said.
“But to get there, everyone - especially large corporations - must carry their fair share of the national burden.”
He noted that while some existing resource development agreements date back to the late 1990s and early 2000s, it was important that these arrangements evolve with global market realities.
“Many of these agreements were signed decades ago under very different economic conditions. With today’s high resource prices, tax contributions must reflect that reality,” he said.
“We respect existing agreements, but fairness and transparency demand that both the State and the companies work together to ensure Papua New Guinea receives equitable benefit from its resources.”
Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed his government’s commitment to strengthening fiscal oversight, increasing domestic revenue collection, and ensuring the mining and petroleum sectors contribute effectively to national development."
"17 houses burnt, communities flee",6/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6331,,Local,Fear,Nill,"Seventeen houses at Horse Camp in Moresby South were burnt to ashes three weeks ago, after an Engan man was murdered by a man from Gulf.
The Commander of the National Capital District and Central, Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police, Benjamin Turi, led a team of police units who visited Horse Camp in Moresby South this morning after learning that almost all the people from Gulf who reside there had left in fear after their houses were burned by alleged Engan men.
Commander Turi and his officers, while at the scene, confirmed that about seventeen houses were burned to ashes three weeks ago after an Engan man was murdered by a man from Gulf.
Commander Turi said the murder suspect had been arrested and is now in police custody. He stated that the Engans do not have any right to burn the houses and set up a mourning house in a public area that other innocent Gulf people have access to.
He said the funny thing he learned while visiting the area was that the Engans chased the Gulf people out of their houses, and then they got power from one of the houses and connected it to their mourning house that they are hosting at Sabama.
""This is Port Moresby City, and we do not want to see people bringing their village mentality to the city. Burning down houses and then trying to claim the land is not right and is unlawful. We will investigate the matter and have those who burned down the houses arrested and charged, just like we did to the person who murdered the Engan man.
“I am calling on the Engans who are supporting their tribesmen to set up the mourning house and demand K200,000 compensation to stop. We have names of people who are doing that. They will be arrested and charged soon,"" Commander Turi said.
He said the owners of the houses that were burnt down by the Engans and those who fled Horse Camp must work closely with Badili Police and provide statements so they can fast-track the case. He stated that the police will patrol that area to ensure that those who left their houses return and that those who are not residents there must not go there and create new problems.
Commander Turi, who was with police officers from Badili and other police units, visited the arson sites and advised the victims to work with the police."
Sentencing conference opens,6/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6332,,Law,Anticipation,Nill,"Over 76 magistrates from Papua New Guinea are in attendance for a three-day National Sentencing Parity Conference in Port Moresby.
The conference, opened today by Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika,  aims to identify issues with making sentences, especially in criminal matters. It is driven by a dire need to find impartiality and balance in the sentencing space.
Chief Magistrate Mark Pupaka said magistrates, including judges, are judicial officers bound by an oath to respect the constitution and to implement justice without fear or favor when making sentences prescribed by the law.
“As we find imparity in the sentencing space, we also need to visibly demonstrate to our stakeholders, the country, and our people that we respect the rule of law in the context as judicial officers sitting on the district court bench and responsible leaders able to create deterrence in each matter neither civil or criminal that comes before us on a daily basis,” he said.
Pupaka said stability and safety in the sentencing space have been lacking for years. Hence, the conference will create pathways on how magistrates can manage this issue.
Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika said imposing a sentence based on the law is not easy due to humanitarian grounds, but legal practitioners must not use this as an excuse.
“Many people think it is easy to sentence a person, hearing the evidence and acting on that evidence is okay, but to give a sentence is a difficult job,” he said.
He urged magistrates to highlight the issues of sentencing in their respective courtrooms and learn from each other on how best they can improve the sentencing space of the law and justice sector.
Sir Gibbs warned magistrates not to misuse their power as guardians of the law when convicting and imposing sentences.
“We are powerful people, but our power must be used with responsibility; don’t abuse the power of sentencing. The power we have is also subject to appeals in the National or Supreme Court,” he said."

A modern horror story,6/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6334,,Society,Anger,Nill,"With both legs tied to a cut tree branch, a woman’s lifeless body was hoisted as a pig as young men carried her and placed her next to a fire.
Men, women and children were watching this incident and taking videos at a settlement called ‘As Mambu’ at Backroad, in Lae, Morobe Province.
With a visible cut to the right side of her head, and blood coating her face, this woman was one of three who were accused of practicing “sanguma”, or sorcery, and were tortured on Wednesday, October 1, 2025.
She was placed next to a seated elderly woman whose hair and body were covered in soot and soil. Her hands were tied behind her back, her stretched legs were also tied together in front of her while her bowed head showed no signs of consciousness.
A third woman, bearing the same bloody and dishevelled appearance as the other two but with a torn blouse and still conscious, was brutally kicked by a man who was armed with two bush knives as a voice in the background yelled: “Burn them in the fire!”
The man taking the video could be heard clearly narrating that “The community has not developed because of these women”.
“As you all can see, this is Backroad, Lae city, where these sanguma are doing their dirty deeds and now men have apprehended them and are killing them,” he said.
Lae metropolitan superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, said this barbaric act has claimed the lives of two women while another is at the ANGAU Memorial Provincial Hospital.
One of the victims was from Simbu while the other two are from Menyamya.
“Five suspects were apprehended, including the person taking the video,” said chief superintendent Kunyanban.
“Because we were so busy on Friday – the entire police were engaged in the arrival of the late governor’s casket on Friday – straight after that, we prioritised their arrest on Saturday, October 4th.
“The first suspect apprehended was the one who took the video, while the other four followed after.”
The Lae head of police relented that while PNG’s culture is deeply-rooted in traditional practices and beliefs that include sorcery, laws need to be established to specifically deal with what he described as “two sides to a coin”.
“But what they have done is totally wrong; they cannot take the law into their own hands.”
While some social media users believed that the person who took the video should be treated as a “whistleblower”, Kunyanban said: “If he was serious about the offence, he should’ve told the police about it. Why put it on Facebook? Is that the police station?”
Investigation is continuing into the incident, with more arrests expected.
Those implicated are expected to be charged with two counts of wilful murder each, and attempted murder on the life of the third survivor.
Kunyanban said this is the first reported case of sorcery-accusation related violence (SARV) from As Mambu."

-	Formation of an Interim Inter-Agency Taskforce – comprising the Department of ICT, NICTA, Office of Censorship, Royal PNG Constabulary, and Department of Justice & Attorney General, to oversee the first phase of implementation.
-	Mandatory Digital ID Integration – introduction of SevisPass as the required digital ID credential for accessing social media platforms, strengthening online accountability.
-	Platform Accountability – all social media platforms operating in PNG will be required to legally register, comply with PNG laws, and route their traffic through the national Internet Exchange Point (IXP) to ensure transparency and oversight.
-	Awareness and Education Programs – nationwide digital literacy and e-safety campaigns to equip citizens, particularly young people, with the knowledge and skills to navigate online spaces responsibly.
The Policy also provides enforcement measures, including penalties for cyber harassment, defamation, and the spread of misinformation. Social media is a powerful tool for communication, education, and national development, but it also presents risks such as online abuse, fake news, and exploitation of vulnerable users.
This Policy strikes the right balance by upholding freedom of expression while ensuring safety, decency, and accountability online."
Marape Launches Reset PNG@50 to Drive Reform and Strengthen Nation,5/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6311,,Politics,Anticipation,"Charles Abel, James Marape","Prime Minister James Marape has announced the National Executive Council’s (NEC) endorsement of Reset PNG@50, Papua New Guinea’s new reform blueprint to guide national policy, planning, and implementation over the next 20 years.
Describing it as a “decisive turning point,” Marape said Reset PNG@50 marks the nation’s reflection on 50 years of independence while charting a bold course toward Vision 2050. The roadmap was shaped through the 50-Year Review and extensive nationwide consultations, led by a Steering Committee chaired by Charles Abel, with Arthur Somare as Deputy Chair, supported by technical experts and development partners.
The review included input from the National Research Institute (NRI), Consultative Implementation and Monitoring Council (CIMC), UNDP, and Australian National University (ANU), drawing insights from more than 50 consultations across urban and rural communities.
“Reset@50 is not a new plan. Papua New Guinea has many excellent plans - what we have lacked is implementation,” Marape said. “For 50 years, progress has been slow and uneven. Reset@50 ensures we deliver on commitments and translate reforms into real outcomes for our people.”
Guiding Priorities
The reform framework focuses on five key areas:
-	Protecting the Constitution - Strengthening parliamentary governance, restoring constitutional balance, enforcing finance rules, and operationalising the Sovereign Wealth Fund.
-	Advancing Human Development - Expanding universal access to family and maternal health, and improving nationwide electricity and internet connectivity.
-	Evidence-Based Governance - Establishing a Parliamentary Budget Office, stronger oversight, and a trusted National Identity system.
-	Smart, Sustainable Growth - Driving private-sector-led growth, reforming SOEs, modernising agriculture, and freeing land for development.
-	Accountability and Delivery - Reforming the bureaucracy, cleansing the payroll, and strengthening results-driven service delivery.
Quick Wins (Next Two Years)
The government has outlined immediate priorities, including stabilising the budget, improving frontline health and education, removing ghost names from payrolls, and fast-tracking rural electricity and internet rollout.
Delivery and Oversight
A new delivery unit, headed by former Deputy Prime Minister Charles Abel, will oversee implementation with support from public servants, private sector experts, and development partners.
“Charles Abel has the track record and vision to guide Reset@50 from planning into action,” Marape said. “His leadership will be vital in ensuring the next two years deliver real outcomes for our people.”
All government agencies and state-owned enterprises are required to cooperate, with non-compliance treated as a dismissible offence. Regular progress reports will be submitted to NEC and made public.
Call to Action
Marape urged all Papua New Guineans to take ownership of the national reform effort.
“Government alone cannot deliver Reset@50. This is about our people holding leaders accountable. Demand results, question decisions, and participate actively. Only then will these reforms succeed,” he said.
“Do not leave nation-building to politicians and bureaucrats alone. If each of us plays our part - in our villages, churches, schools, and workplaces - together we will transform PNG. This is our moment to unite and declare that the next 20 years will be different. Bung wantaim, raka hebou - together, with courage and conviction, we will reset our country and build the Papua New Guinea we have always dreamed of.”
Marape concluded: “We are ready to reset. We are ready to deliver. We are ready to build a stronger Papua New Guinea.”"

PM Marape reaffirms commitment to Enga,5/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6318,,Government,Trust,"James Marape, Peter Ipatas, Sir Peter Ipatas","The Government has committed to ensuring that the people of Enga Province directly benefit from the new Porgera Mine and from the nation’s broader economic growth under the reset agenda.
Speaking in Enga on Friday, October 3, Prime Minister James Marape said the Government’s focus is on growing the national economy so that more resources can flow back to provinces and communities.
“In the first six months of this year alone, Porgera contributed over K500 million in corporate tax,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“From that, Enga Provincial Government has already received K48 million, while K96 million for landowners is being kept in trust until the conclusion of the Community Development Agreement (CDA) this month. These benefits are far better than the old arrangements, and they reflect our government’s way of securing more for landowners, provincial governments, and the nation.”
The new Porgera arrangements will continue to generate substantial benefits, with another K500 million in corporate tax expected this year, alongside provincial and landowner dividends.
Prime Minister Marape announced that he will return to Porgera later this month to outline the different benefit streams that will be delivered.
He also endorsed the Porgera policy requiring all businesses operating at the mine to have addresses in Enga Province, but cautioned that lasting benefits require peace and order.
“How can businesses take residence in Enga when we are still engaged in tribal fights?” he asked.
“I appeal to our people to lay down arms, protect the land and environment, and allow development to take root. The Government is working to strengthen police presence and build more correctional facilities so law and order can be maintained. We want benefits to flow back to our people, but stability is essential.”
The Prime Minister commended Governor Sir Peter Ipatas for his leadership, highlighting major provincial achievements, including:
• The Innovative University of Enga, now operational, with campuses being developed
• Enga Provincial Hospital, fully commissioned and set to be fully staffed next year
• K8 million funding for a new large holding facility at Mukurumanda Correctional Service to support law enforcement.
The Prime Minister reaffirmed that Enga’s resource wealth, combined with national and provincial government commitments, places the province at the center of Papua New Guinea’s reset agenda to drive inclusive development.
“Our government has not lost faith in Enga. You are our country’s biggest language group, one province with one language. We urge you to put politics aside, unite, and take ownership of peace and progress. Resources are no longer the problem – Progeria’s new agreement is the best in the country – but our people must settle down to benefit,” Prime Minister Marape said."

Speaking at the handover of Governor Wenge’s body in Lae on Friday, Prime Minister Marape said Wenge’s deep commitment to the people, both as a legislator and public servant, stood as a shining example for the country.
“His contribution to Papua New Guinea, whether in the law and justice sector or in political life, stands tall,” PM Marape said. “If the people’s love for a leader does not motivate us to do the right thing for our country, then we are in the wrong place doing the wrong thing for Papua New Guinea.”
The Prime Minister thanked the people of Morobe for their support, saying their confidence gave him hope. He also highlighted four major initiatives that Governor Wenge strongly advocated for in partnership with the National Government:
1. Hidden Valley Mine – Renewal of the mining lease to sustain operations and benefits, which Wenge fought to secure.
2. Wafi-Golpu Project – Progress on a new and fairer benefit-sharing agreement is expected to deliver substantial revenues to the State, Morobe, and landowners.
3. Nadzab Redevelopment – Relocation of Tutumang and the development of Nadzab as a provincial hub and gateway city.
4. Lae and Morobe Growth – Positioning Lae and Morobe as a major provincial headquarters under the “Nadzab City” vision, driving both regional and national development.
“These are the things we worked on together with Governor Wenge, my Cabinet, and the relevant ministers,” PM Marape said. “Morobe’s progress is Papua New Guinea’s progress.
Governor Wenge belongs to that generation of leaders whose legacy of service shaped our nation.”
The Prime Minister assured the people of Morobe that his government would honour and complete the projects Wenge had championed.
“Morobe has contributed great leaders to our country, and one of them lies before us today,” PM Marape said. “His memory must inspire us to serve with integrity and purpose for the betterment of Papua New Guinea.”
The Prime Minister extended his condolences to the family, people, and tribe of Morobe.
“May God bless the family, the tribe, and the people of Morobe. The passing of your leader reminds us all to do better for Morobe and for Papua New Guinea,” PM Marape said."

Manning Directs Senior Police To Report To Highlands Posts,4/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6295,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"Following the appointment of Anthony Junior Wagambie as Operations Commander for joint security operations in the Upper Highlands, Police Commissioner David Manning has summoned senior police personnel tasked to lead the restoration of law and order in Highlands hotspots, and ordered them to depart for their respective posts effective immediately.
Senior personnel summoned by Commissioner Manning included Operational Commander, Commander Anthony Wagambie Jr; Divisional Commander Western End, Chief Superintendent Joseph Tondop; Southern Highlands Provincial Police Commander, Superintendent Epenes Nili; and, Hela Provincial Police Commander, Superintendent Michael Welly.
Commissioner Manning is concerned that despite the rise in crime in the highlands, less number of arrests have been made.
“The low numbers of arrest in these commands is unacceptable. It will not be tolerated. Arrest will be delivered or those in these commands will be held to account.
“Disciplined forces are not normal public sector agencies, we have chains of command and personnel who fail to follow directions will face the consequences.”
He said he has been tolerant, but enough is enough and officers that are listed for deployment will be in place to carry out their duties or be stood aside.
“There is very little our senior operations personnel can do from behind a desk in Port Moresby when shots are being fired, people being attacked and homes being burned in the Highlands,” Commissioner said at a briefing with senior police.
“The threats we face from domestic terrorist groups that use violence as part of wider criminal activities will be overcome, and this is a law enforcement operation that is being carried out on the ground in affected areas.
“I am disappointed that some in senior leadership positions are not on the ground in the Highlands leading the security force personnel, and they can and will do better.
“These senior personnel will be in place in the Highlands, working with Commander Wagambie who has responsibility for restoring order in these troubled areas.
Commissioner Manning also sounded his disgust at sorcery related violence seen on video over recent days.
“Investigations are underway into this barbaric attack, and police will move in on the community involved.
“Sorcery violence is not a part of our culture in the modern world, and everyone has a responsibility to stand up and stop these pathetic actions.
“As this investigation continues and additional information is available it will be shared with the public.
“While the causes of violence requires community leaders to take charge of their people before crimes are committed, the full force of the law is at our disposal to clean up the threat that they pose to innocent people.
“I have given direction that security forces will have zero tolerance in confronting domestic terrorists, particularly when weapons are used.
“Security forces also need the co-operation and support of local leaders stepping up and doing the right thing.
“Any community leader who protects violent criminals is just as guilty as the domestic terrorists, murderers and rapists they are protecting.”"

For almost eleven years, the college was on the brink of shutting down due to poor management and lack of support. However, with the leadership of former principal James Buri, current principal Peter Kol, and board chairman Moses Kawage, the institution has been revitalized with better governance and renewed confidence.
Mr. Kol said it has been extremely challenging to run a large institution with only K600 in the account, but with the support of his staff and the school management committee, the college managed to survive. “This vehicle marks a new chapter in improving the services for our students and administration,” he said.
Simbu Teachers College, which caters to students from all six districts of Simbu Province and other provinces, has not received consistent support from the provincial government in the last five years.
Despite this, the leadership acknowledged the contributions of Governor Noah Kool and Sinasine-Yongumugl MP Kerenga Kua for assisting with classrooms, vehicles, and a dining hall.
Board chairman Mr. Kawage praised the teamwork between staff and the governing council, stating that good management practices have lifted the standards of the institution.
He emphasised the urgent need for further infrastructure development, including classrooms, dormitories, and transportation, to give students a better chance at quality education.
The college is now appealing to the Simbu Provincial Government and MPs from all six districts to step in with stronger support to secure its long-term future."

He added that the long-term dream of this project is not only to produce power but also to sell power.
Maru said the only challenge now is to bring in investors, with the support of the government, to fund this project.
“If we build this hydro, it will be clean, cheaper and reliable for all the villages to access. It will open doors for our people to live in modern houses as well,” Maru said.
PNG Power CEO, Paul Bayly, said PNG Power will support this project. However, they need the support of the community to drive this project.

Residents urged to look after business houses,3/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6281,,Community,Fear,Nill,"Chief Secretary to the Government and long-time Rainbow resident, Ambassador Ivan Pomaleu has urged residents there to look after business houses, by ensuring that they are secure to provide service to the community.
He made this appeal during the launch of road maintenance work at Rainbow last week, calling on residents not to repeat what happened in January 10, 2024, which affected business houses with millions of kina worth of damage.
“The result of January 10th has caused our mothers to struggle to get service outside. Options and opportunities to look for groceries were hard. Our mothers and fathers had to travel far to look for groceries. Therefore, I appeal to you all that those business houses that are doing business in our community and those that will come later, it's up to us to secure them.
“Police capacity is not enough to cater to all sectors in the city, especially our suburbs. Therefore, we have to self-regulate; we have to be the ones who hold our community together in good and bad times.
“We must blame ourselves for the January 10th incident because at that time, children and adults celebrated the looting in our very own community. It shows that the community cannot self-regulate; we lose control when the higher authority is lacking. When the police withdrawdraw their service, the community cannot be held together.
“The government will give us service, and the business house will provide service, but it is our responsibility to maintain the stability of our community. Today's livelihood demands our own stability.
“I urge our mothers and fathers to take control of our children, so that we can worry about what the authorities can do to us,” he said."
Rainbow needs proper market facility,3/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6290,,Local,Anger,Nill,"Rainbow Estate market vendors are calling on the government to establish a proper market facility for them to use. Currently, the vendors do not have a proper market facility, and are selling their produce at the side of the road.
These vendors are often chased by police or come into conflict with PMV operators. The dust created by passing vehicles is also another hazard.
Miriam Peter has been selling her produce at the Rainbow Estate informal market for years. Her challenge has always been finding enough space to trade. Those times when there isn’t enough space available, she would go to Gerehu market or Waigani market, but even vendors there know she’s not a regular and would often tell her to go back to her regular marketplace.
“When we go to Waigani, the vendors there will remove our food and tell us to go back to where we came from. Gerehu vendors will do the same. Therefore, we make sure to always clean the roadside and sell our produce because we have nowhere else to sell our produce,” Peter said.
While Vendor Merilyn Dickson said a proper market facility is what they need to store and sell their produce.
“We carry our produce to the market every day because of no proper place to store our produce. Therefore, if the government establishes our own marketplace, it will ease that burden,” she said.
Chief Secretary to the Government and long-time Rainbow Estate resident, Ambassador Ivan Pomaleu supports the call for a proper market infrastructure.
Pomaleu said when the market facility is established, PMV buses and other vehicles will be parked in the right place, and pedestrians can access the market facility safely and with ease."

The foundation NTP was launched by the O’Neil Government in 2017 when Minister Maru was then the Minister for Trade, Commerce, and Industry. The Marape-Rosso Government had commenced the mid-term review of the NTP with the assistance of the PNG European Union (EU) Delegation.
Minister Maru said the mid-term review was necessary from PNG’s national trade perspective, to ensure the NTP was on track to achieve its goals and recalibrate the country’s trade strategy in light of current national and global challenges.
“PNG’s trade performance and policy implementation over the past eight years need a thorough assessment so successes can be built and shortcomings addressed. The review will help PNG align its trade policy with recent domestic priorities such as the Medium-Term Development Plan IV and post-COVID economic recovery, and external developments like environmental considerations, new market opportunities in Asia, and evolving World Trade Organization rules.
The review will enable PNG to adopt international best practices, foster stakeholder engagement, and ultimately ensure that trade policy remains effective and relevant,” said Minister Maru.
The three main elements to review are:
1. A review of the NTP to take stock of the progress, determine how effective the policy measures have contributed to the attainment of the objectives, and identify key challenges with implementation.
2. A prospective assessment that takes into account the current and emerging trade issues at the international and national levels and recommends adjustments.
3. Review of the NTP’s Strategic Implementation Plan and integration of its findings.
Minister Maru directed the Policy Review Team to capture, among other issues:
Moving away from Regional Trade Agreements that do not serve PNG’s national interest to focusing on Bilateral Trade Agreements;
Placing emphasis on export of value-added finished products and high export taxes for raw products;
Incentives for new products for exports, including support on certification and meeting standards;
Transfer of Tariff Policy function from the Department of Treasury to the National Trade Office;
The possibility of having legislation to guide and address challenges associated with Ease of Doing Business;
Legislation to ensure that only bankable land with clear titles for large-scale Special Economic Zone development;
Policy measures to strengthen the Kina and stop capital flights, including building a gold refinery and building PNG’s gold reserves in Bank of PNG;
Using artificial intelligence to support and facilitate trade and investment initiatives; and
A new electronic Single Window System to facilitate trade to replace the manual system used today.
The NTO will take the lead in the review. However, Minister Maru stressed that input from other Government departments and agencies, provincial representatives, and regulatory bodies was
The draft of the new Trade Policy will be delivered to Minister Maru and the National Executive Council by October 15, 2025, for approval before it is launched by the end of this year."

Wards in Rabaul reconcile,2/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6271,,Community,Joy,Nill,"A plea for peace from mothers and women was finally realised in Balanataman Local Level Government area in Rabaul, East New Britain Province, this week.
It was pleasing news from the recent fights between youths from Ratavul Karavia and Volavolo wards in the Balanataman LLG.
A march for ‘Re-Union for Peace’ this week was held along the Nonga road from Volavolo Ward by Youths from Volavolo to the Ratavul Mission Grounds to join the Ratavul Youths who were waiting to receive them to Reconcile and Reunite for Peace.
A Reconciliation and Reunion for Peace ceremony was held in response to the tensions and unfortunate incidents, including fights and the destruction of homes. During this gathering, the community sought healing and forgiveness.
The reconciliation came about following constant meetings between Ward Development Committee members and the community and church elders. This marked a breakthrough in resolving the ongoing conflicts between the youths of Volavolo and Ratavul to announce that from this point forward, there will be ‘NO more fighting’.
Church elder and evangelist Bernie Benson delivered a powerful message inspired by the Word of God, emphasizing the importance of intervention and forgiveness. He proclaimed that this reconciliation signifies God's supernatural intervention through the Holy Spirit, restoring peace in the hearts of our young people.
“It was all God's doing and making. It was a powerful Kingdom Intervention as the Word of God, which is the Word of Peace, was released, opening up hearts and minds. Praise God and thank you to those who have been praying for peace between Volavolo and Ratavul,” he said.
Elder Benson shared a profound message underscoring that true peace comes from having a relationship with Jesus Christ. He pointed out that when individuals have peace in their hearts, they are more capable of forgiving others, as highlighted in Matthew 6:14-15
""When you forgive others, God will forgive you of your sins.”

Today, Port Moresby hosted the 3rd Climate Change Summit 2025 to address PNG’s concerns and the way forward.
The 2-day Summit, with the first day concluding today, was based on discussions around this year’s theme, “Empowering inclusivity and accelerating climate change action for resilience and sustainable PNG”.
The meeting brought together high-level delegates from all stakeholders, hosted by the Minister for Environment Conservation and Climate Change Development Authority, Simo Kilepa, and the Acting Managing Director for CCDA, Debra Sungi.

Minister Kilepa also highlighted at the summit the challenges PNG faces on climate change.
“Rising seas are swallowing our coastlines, extreme weather continues to destroy our villages and shifting seasons threaten the food our people depend on. This is not a future problem. It is here.
It is now.  That is why this Summit matters. Over the next two days, we will bring together government, private sector, development partners, provincial leaders and community voices. We will recognize those who have worked tirelessly in this fight and share knowledge that can guide our way forward,” Mr. Kilepa said.

1.	Reform and Governance: Climate Change Management Act 2023 amended and established National Climate Change Board.
2.	Carbon Market Regulation: The NEC approved our Carbon Market Regulation 2024. This opens the door for international investment in our forests and carbon projects, while ensuring that benefits flow back to our people.

4.	Global Finance Breakthroughs: Earlier this year, we hosted the 42nd Green Climate Fund Board Meeting here in Port Moresby. As a result, PNG secured US$63.4 million in Results-Based Payments for REDD+, and USD 9 million for the Source Pacific Drinking Water Project. These are not abstract numbers – they mean resources in our hands to deliver change on the ground.
5.	 Community-Level Action-BRCC Projects: Through the Building Resilience to Climate Change program, tangible improvements have been delivered, including new boats, wharves for safe transport, rainwater catchments and sanitation systems, resilience projects across Bougainville, East New Britain, and Milne Bay, Morobe and Manus.

Plans to revive IIimo farm,2/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6279,,Business,Anticipation,"Richard Maru, Rufina Peter","The Central Provincial Government in partnership with the Ministry of Trade and Investment, is putting in plans to revive the Ilimo Farm.
The Governor for Central Province Rufina Peter met with the Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru recently, to discuss a way forward in reviving the Ilimo Farm just outside Port Moresby.
The Ilimo Farm was once a huge supplier of chicken meat and eggs to Port Moresby. It is owned by the Central Provincial Government’s business arm, Central Province Development Corp.
Governor Rufina expressed her keen interest in reviving this farm to supply chicken meat, eggs, and day-old chicks to meet the requirements of Port Moresby and the Southern Region.
Governor Rufina and Minister Maru also discussed about a cattle industry in the Central Province to produce up to 10,000 cattle required to supply the Hugo Canning cannery.
Governor Rufina said the Central Provincial Government can partner the National Government through Kumul Agriculture, Taylor Pacific, and other stakeholders to go into these large-scale agriculture projects in Central Province.
Minister Maru welcomed the prospect of reviving this farm.
“The Ilimo Farm is a prime property, and it needs to be revived immediately. My Ministry and Department will fully support this project because we cannot continue to import K200 million worth of chickens annually. The Marape-Rosso Government is keen to replace all chicken imports and be a net exporter of chicken,” said Minister Maru.
Also present in the meeting were the Chairman of the PNG Poultry Industry Association Chis Prestwood, and the General Manager of Hugo Canning Jeremy Fry, who both agreed that this was a very exciting opportunity and the sooner the project starts the better.
“These are industries that are ready to pop,” said Mr. Fry.
Minister Maru now awaits a joint investment proposal to be submitted to his office to progress these projects of national significance.
“For cattle, unless we produce local beef to supply Hugo Canning, we cannot reduce the price of Ox and Palm, which has now increased by nearly 100 percent compared to previous years because of the expensive imports from Australia and the declining Kina value,” said Minister Maru.
Meanwhile, Governor Rufina raised concerns that the Ilimo Dairy Farm, owned by Innovative Agriculture Industry had not declared a profit since its establishment. Central Provincial Government is a 30 percent shareholder and has put down 400 hectares of land for the farm.
Governor Rufina expressed her disappointment and said it was high time a new management was put in place, and for the farm to invest in long-life milk with a better breed of dairy cattle to increase milk production at the farm."

Talks on FATF grey listing continues as PNG reaches deadline,2/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6277,,Business,Fear,Nill,"Papua New Guinea is at a critical juncture as the October deadline set by by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to address deficiencies in Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML/CTF) inorder to avoid consequences of grey listing is finally here.
The AML/CTF/CPF Conference continued at APEC Haus today, bringing together government agencies, financial institutions, civil society, and international partners under the banner:
“Fighting Financial Crime is Everyone’s Business.”
In her opening address, Governor Elizabeth Genia of the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) issued a stark warning: PNG’s placement under increased monitoring by the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) demands urgent and credible action.
“Success will not be measured by reports written, but by criminals held accountable and proceeds of crime recovered,” Genia declared.
The Governor emphasized that PNG’s 2024 Mutual Evaluation Report exposed serious deficiencies in the effectiveness of its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing framework. Without swift reforms, PNG risks prolonged grey-listing, which could damage its financial reputation and economic prospects.
The conference, hosted by BPNG in partnership with Transparency International PNG (TIPNG), is open to the public and aims to foster national unity in combating corruption. Genia called on all sectors—government, private industry, civil society, and citizens—to take ownership of the fight against illicit finance.
“These crimes do not exist in isolation, they affect our livelihoods, our access to services, our opportunities, and our wellbeing,” she said.
Sessions have focused on: Enforcement under the AML/CFT Act, Regional crime trends and typologies, the role of the Financial Analysis and Supervision Unit (FASU),Regulation of virtual assets, and strengthening oversight of Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs)
Governor Genia outlined a series of reforms already underway, including updates to the Proceeds of Crime Act, the formation of joint task forces, and enhanced inter-agency coordination. She stressed that financial inclusion must remain a priority, ensuring that AML measures do not exclude vulnerable populations from the formal economy.
“Government has endorsed these reforms. Agencies represented here today are under clear instructions to fulfill their roles,” Genia affirmed.
International partners such as Australia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are supporting PNG’s efforts to build a resilient and transparent financial system.
As the conference enters its final day, the message is clear, PNG must act decisively. The final communiqué is expected to outline next steps for national implementation, with a focus on measurable outcomes and accountability.
“Let us learn, contribute, and act together,” Genia urged. “These discussions will translate into better outcomes—helping reduce our time on the grey list and building a stronger, more respected financial system for the people of Papua New Guinea.”

When a country is grey listed, it means FATF has found serious weaknesses in how that country handles financial crime. The country is not being punished, but it is under close watch and must fix the problems quickly.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is a global watchdog that checks how well countries stop financial crimes like money laundering, terrorism financing, and corruption.
Think of it like being put on probation. The country must improve its laws and enforcement, catch and punish financial criminals, work better across government agencies, and prove it’s serious about protecting its economy.
For PNG, being grey listed could mean delays in international money transfers, less foreign investment, higher costs for businesses and banks, and damage to the country’s reputation.
Governor Genia and other leaders warned that PNG is very likely to be grey listed by February 2026 unless urgent reforms are made. The deadline to show progress is October 2025.
Everyone has a role to play, citizens, businesses, lawyers, banks, and government agencies, to help PNG avoid grey listing and build a stronger, safer financial system."
Cabinet approves PNG-Aus Defence Treaty,2/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6276,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"Cabinet has formally approved the Mutual Defence Treaty between Papua New Guinea and Australia, elevating the two countries’ defence and security partnership to its highest level in history.
“Australia has only one other mutual defence treaty of this type and at our request Papua New Guinea will now sign this treaty”. Prime Minister Marape said. “This reflects the depth of trust, history, and shared future between our two nations.”
The Prime Minister clarified that the treaty will undergo the constitutional Section 117 process, with the ratification presented to the PNG Parliament, while Australia will undertake its own ratification through its Parliament in Canberra.
“Our Constitution is not offended by this agreement. Section 206 of our Constitution allows for our Defence Force to work in synergy with other visiting defence forces, and this treaty is consistent with that provision,” Prime Minister Marape emphasised.
The relationship between PNG and Australia is long and enduring and has been anchored in many areas of cooperation. For Defence, PNG operated under a Status of Forces Agreement after independence and, in 2013, signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement with Australia.
“Now this treaty elevates our relationship to the highest level, where force synergies, and capacity development for interoperability is reached. Australia is our foundational relationship country. We are geographically close and beyond geography, our people have coexisted well before 1975 and after independence. Today, Australia remains our single biggest bilateral partner, and consistent with our past, we are shaping our future,” the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Marape stressed that the treaty is not about geopolitics.
“Papua New Guinea is a big country with over 10 million people and security fragility is evident and it is PNG’s interest to develop our security forces to best standards and with this synergy, I am certain we will reach this goal.
“This treaty allows PNG’s defence capacity to be elevated by leveraging Australian defence capabilities. This partnership strengthens our ability to respond to our country’s key security priorities.
The treaty outlines steps to modernise and strengthen PNG’s defence capacity across all domains:
• Navy and Maritime Security: Increased capacity to police PNG’s vast maritime borders.
• Air Wing and Air Defence: Enhanced air force capacity through new capabilities and training.
• Infantry and Land Battalions: Strengthened land forces and the establishment of special forces arrangements.
• Reserve and National Guard: Development of 3,000 reservists and national volunteers, with provisions for up to 10,000 Papua New Guineans to serve with the Australian Defence Force under dual arrangements, while PNG builds its own 7,000-strong Defence Force.
“This treaty is not just about maintaining barracks and boats. We are investing in both hardware and software for defence so that we can effectively police our borders and safeguard our nation,” Prime Minister Marape explained.
Prime Minister Marape assured the nation that PNG’s sovereignty remains intact.
“Our Defence Force will always report to the Commander of the PNG Defence Force. Australians, including Papua New Guineans enlisted into the Australian Defence Force, will report to the Australian commander.
“Both forces will train and operate side by side, but sovereignty is never compromised. We also respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our neighbours.”
The treaty also recognises that both PNG and Australia maintain defence relationships with other nations. “Provisions are in place to respect third-party relationships,” Prime Minister Marape said.
Looking to the future, Prime Minister Marape described the treaty as a foundation for the next chapter of PNG’s history.
“Our sovereignty is defined by our national security. This treaty strengthens PNG’s security and defence capacities as we embark on the next 50 years. It is about ensuring Papua New Guinea is safe, secure, and prepared to protect its people and borders.”"

According to the Election Manager for Madang Sponsa Navi, most of the materials have been already arrived at the polling locations except for Kovon and Simbai LLGs in the Middle Ramu district due to road accessibility. These two locations will have a plane drop their materials by next week.
“As part of the preparations that are underway, all officials have been in training the last couple of weeks. Deployment of all materials have been ongoing with the last two LLGs in the Middle Ramu district to be dropped off later this week or by next week.

According to Mr. Navi from the previous elections, an estimate of K2 million remains in debt to service providers. This can only be cleared off when money is made available from the electoral commission.
Despite the debts, it is anticipated that this election should be carried out peacefully in the province."

Among his government’s planned reforms for the parliament is to have a separate budget line for the Opposition.
“We want the Opposition to be properly resourced, not held to ransom, because they are an essential part of the Check-and-Balance mechanism for our Democracy. A vibrant Parliament requires strong Committees and an empowered Opposition that can hold Government to account,” he stated.
According to opposition leader, Douglas Tomuriesa, the Office of the Opposition is dependent on funding from the speaker and clerks.
“We operate under the mercy of the Speaker and the Clerks. If they have additional funds, we are given some money to operate otherwise we just toughen it out by what is provided,” Tomuriesa stated.
The Speaker emphasized the need for parliament as the legislature to receive the same level of diligence and support as the Executive and Judiciary.
The 2026 National Parliament Budget Submission includes provisions for physical renovations to Parliament House, modernisation of ICT systems for a “Paperless Parliament,” and operational support to strengthen the capacity of Members of Parliament and Parliamentary Staff, as well as Parliament Library and Archives.
Prime Minister Marape welcomed the Submission and commended the Speaker’s leadership in ensuring Parliament is adequately resourced to meet both present and future needs.
“Our Parliament is not just another building. It is the very 'Seat of Papua New Guinea’s Democracy'. As we celebrate our 50th Independence Anniversary, we must honour and invest in the institution that embodies the voice of our people,” Prime Minister Marape said.
The Prime Minister noted that the Government has already demonstrated strong commitment to the Judiciary through the construction of the new National Court Complex, and pledged that similar support will be extended to the National Parliament.
The Government invested over K400 million over six years to support the construction of the state-of-the-art Court Complex that now houses both the Supreme and National Courts.
Prime Minister Marape added that his Government will go further by maintaining Parliament and constructing a 'new D-Wing', ensuring Parliament is fit for purpose in the decades ahead, making it a modernised 21st century institution worthy of Democracy.
Moving forward, the Prime Minister assured the Speaker and the people of Papua New Guinea that his Government will give serious consideration to the K615 million Submission as part of the 2026 National Budget process."

Magistrates Judicial Orientation program opens,1/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6254,,Government,Trust,Nill,"The three-day Magistrates Judicial Orientation program opened today in Port Moresby and ends on Friday, October 3.
The purpose of this program is to promote judicial competence by assisting newly appointed magistrates to perform their duties and promote excellence in the delivery of justice in district courts.
Nine Magistrates from the Solomon Islands have joined their counterparts in Port Moresby for this program. The program aims to highlight how magistrates apply and balance written law with custom, especially in land, family, and community justice matters.
It will also emphasise conflict of interest, resilience, security, trauma, stress, and mental health.
PNG Chief Magistrate Mark Pupaka said the participation of Solomon Islands in this program signifies the collaboration between the two countries, working together to address judicial issues in both countries.
He said magistrates in both countries often serve remote islands and provinces, with limited resources and heavy caseloads. Therefore, the sessions will stress practical judgment writing, case management with scarce resources, and using technology where possible.
Solomon Islands High Commissioner to PNG William McDonald Soaki said Solomon Islands and PNG have similar law and order challenges and common law systems. Therefore, the lessons learned and experiences shared through this program will be relevant in strengthening the magisterial sectors of both countries.
He urges the magistrates to be attentive, productive, and to gain the necessary knowledge needed to serve their people.
“Take every opportunity these three days to listen, to learn something new, and to share your experiences openly. Strengthen your networks; the knowledge you gain here will not only enhance your own capacity but also contribute to meaningful outputs and ultimately to the people you serve in Solomon Islands and PNG, those who look to you for justice.
“Always remember that your role extends beyond interpreting law; you are a guardian of fairness, you protect the rights, and you build public trust. The decisions you make can restore hope, bring peace to families and communities, and reinforce the confidence of our people in institutions of state,” Soaki said.
Meanwhile, a general course evaluation will be completed at the end of the program. A formal review and report will be prepared for the Magistrate Service Executive management after the completion of the program."
Madang police ready to deliver LLG elections,1/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6261,,Politics,Anticipation,Nill,"Madang police are ready to support and safeguard the delivery of the Local Level Government council elections in the province, according to Provincial Police Commander Acting Superintendent Robert Baim.
He issued a stern warning to anyone seeking to disrupt the elections, stating that the police will swiftly respond to any attempt to compromise the process or to influence the votes.
“We are on standby to assist the Electoral Commission in delivering the long-awaited council elections for our people. Following a sequence of recent events, including the successful Usino-Bundi by-elections in August and nationwide events such as the 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations, we remain well prepared to serve our community and nation,” stated PPC Baim.
During an LLG elections brief today with the PPC and station commander Patrick Walis and Rural Commander Bola Rimula, much concern was raised around polling resources and election logistics constraints.
The meeting also highlighted that the Electoral Commission, the Provincial Government, and each member of the districts must ensure police presence is felt throughout the polling and counting period.
Madang is also one of the provinces that will pilot the LLG president voting. Baim said facilitating ease of access for police personnel to certain remote locations is vital to prevent and maintain law and order.
He said in certain areas, there is no road access, and a chopper or plane landing is the only option, whilst the majority of regions can be accessed via vehicles. However, an urgent need for vehicles is also on demand due to the limited vehicles.
Looking ahead to the next 50 years, the PPC said the focus must be on what lies ahead. Attitudes and values must evolve, and everyone must adhere to established rules and processes as the time comes to appoint running leaders.
“Time to eat lamb flaps and drink cola is gone. Think about how our children will live in the next 50 years, and seriously choose leaders with vision who can guide this nation towards a better Papua New Guinea tomorrow,” Baim added.
The people of Madang have been urged to evaluate leaders based on merit and vision, not merely on factors such as quick return for a short-term, cheap reward, or just because of popularity and relations.
PPC Baim stressed the need to aspire to see changes in mindsets, attitudes, and behaviours, calling on everyone to work with security forces to ensure that the election of good leaders takes due course.
“The power is in the hands of the people. The past is behind us, and the dawn of a new era is upon us. Madang police will not tolerate any misbehavior during the polling and counting period,” PPC Baim reiterated.
Meanwhile, Provincial Election Manager Sponsa Navi, said polling takes place for 7 to 14 days, and counting will take around 3-7 days, but will depend on the LLGs and how organized they are."

NEA Launches Renewable Energy Policies,30/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6240,,Energy,Anticipation,Nill,"The National Energy Authority (NEA) today launched five new policies to guide the use of renewable energy in Papua New Guinea. The policies cover solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and bioenergy.
NEA says these policies will provide a clear pathway for investors, communities, and government to work together in building a cleaner and more reliable energy future.
NEA Managing Director, Ronald Mekeya said the policies will be put into action to modernize infrastructure, improve energy systems, and use PNG’s natural resources more effectively.
“These policies are frameworks to unlock our resources responsibly, strengthen energy security, and turn natural abundance into lasting prosperity,” he said.
Solar Energy
PNG has year-round sunshine. The solar policy aims to deliver electricity to both urban centers and rural communities. It will help households, small businesses, and reduce reliance on costly diesel power.
Wind Energy
Coastal and highland areas have untapped wind resources. The wind policy will encourage investment in wind projects, creating a stable and diverse energy supply.
Hydro Energy
Hydropower has been a main source of electricity in PNG. The hydro policy supports new investments in river-based power and encourages mini-hydro projects in both urban and rural areas.
Geothermal Energy
With PNG located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, geothermal power offers a strong and reliable energy source. The geothermal policy sets out how this potential will be developed responsibly for long-term national benefit.
Bioenergy
PNG’s agriculture sector produces large amounts of organic waste. The bioenergy policy will promote the conversion of waste into energy, creating new industries and jobs, especially in rural areas.
Together, the five policies form the foundation of PNG’s renewable energy future. NEA says they will help cut costs, reduce pollution, and create a stable energy sector that supports the country’s growth."

The fact that PNG Customs is actively seeking two Persons of Interest indicates a robust investigative response to tackle this issue.
Mr Hering’s revelation during the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery highlights the seriousness of the situation and the need for improved enforcement mechanisms in the country's customs and immigration frameworks.
He said illegal smuggling of gold not only has financial implications but also raises concerns about compliance with international regulations regarding the movement of precious metals.
Mr Hering told the Committee that Customs officers were only restricted to certain areas of the Jacksons International airport while the National Airports Corporation takes full responsibility of the facility.
Lack of holding cells to detain suspects is also a challenge that affects the task of Customs officers.
These revelations shocked the Committee members. The involvement of customs authorities also calls for greater cooperation with other law enforcement agencies to ensure that all aspects of the smuggling attempt are investigated, including the network of individuals and potential criminal organizations involved.
“There is a syndicate operating at the airport. We need to tighten the scanning from the entrance until a passenger exits so we can do the full detection on that particular passenger,” Mr Hering told the Committee.
The involvement of customs authorities also calls for greater cooperation with other law enforcement agencies to ensure that all aspects of the smuggling attempt are investigated, including the network of individuals and potential criminal organizations involved.
Additionally, this situation may prompt discussions about enhancing training for customs officers and implementing advanced technology to improve detection and monitoring at airports and other entry points.
Interestingly enough, 22.2kg of gold and passports of the two foreigners were seized, but both men are missing from the Bomana Immigration Detention Centre."
PNG to be grey-listed in February 2026,29/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6230,,Business,Fear,Nill,"Papua New Guinea is set to be greylisted in February 2026 due to issues in its financial systems and regulatory frameworks is a serious matter.
Central Bank’s Financial Analysis and Supervision Unit (FASU) Director, Wilson Onea, revealed this today during the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery hearing in Port Moresby.
Being placed on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) greylist can have significant ramifications for a country, including increased scrutiny from international financial institutions and potential challenges in attracting foreign investment.
Mr Onea’s revelation during the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery highlights the urgent need for reforms to enhance the country’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing measures.
Greylisting usually indicates that a country has deficiencies in its compliance with international standards, which can lead to higher costs for transactions and difficulties for businesses operating in or trading with PNG.
The government will need to take proactive steps to address the underlying issues that led to this impending greylisting.
Actions may include strengthening regulatory frameworks, enhancing the capacity of related institutions, conducting comprehensive risk assessments, and fostering transparency in financial transactions.
Moreover, engaging with international partners to improve compliance measures and adherence to global standards will be critical.
The consequences of greylisting also extend to public perception, potentially affecting tourism and foreign investment.
Therefore, Papua New Guinea must prioritize reforms in its financial and regulatory landscape to mitigate the impacts of greylisting and work towards regaining a stable standing in the international financial community."
3rd National Climate Change Summit vital,29/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6229,,Environment,Anticipation,Nill,"The 3rd National Climate Change Summit will be held in Port Moresby on October 1 and 2, this week. The summit will evaluate how the sector has progressed from the outcomes of the last summit held in 2023.
This was announced today by Minister for Environment Conservation and Climate Change, Simo Kilepa, at a press conference, accompanied by Acting Managing Director for Climate Change and Development Authority, Debra Sungi.
Sungi said the 2nd National Summit took place in Port Moresby two years ago (2023), and in the next two days, it will be the 3rd gathering. She thanked the sponsors, other development partners, and stakeholders who had been part of the implementation plan of the national adaptation plan.
“The Climate Change summit will bring all our stakeholders together to identify the work each of the sectors has done over the years, from our 2nd national with the outcome as a communique, the Waigani communique. We have a couple of key outcomes that were discussed in the second climate summit,” Sungi said.
She said the National Climate Change Development Authority, under Minister Kilepa, had progressed a lot over the two years, from the last summit we hosted.
“Some of the things I would like to make mention of in terms of key achievements, one is our efforts in climate finance mobilization,” Sungi said.
She added that apart from that, Climate Finance Mobilization, the Climate Change Development Authority has actually set up a climate finance unit which works together with key stakeholders to effectively mobilize the climate finance."
"MV IBK delivers materials, food on maiden trip",28/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6211,,Local,Joy,Soroi Eoe,"On Wednesday, September 24, at a private dockyard in Motukea, Port Moresby, MV IBK made its first trip. On board the vessel were food supplies and building materials.
MV IBK is named after three key local-level government areas in Gulf Province: Ihu, Baimuru, and Kikori.
The vessel was purchased in July 2025 by the Kikori District Development Authority (DDA) to address critical transport needs across the district, especially between Port Moresby, Kerema, Ihu, Baimuru, and Kikori.
Member for Kikori and Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, Soroi Eoe, who was accompanied by his staff and security personnel, as well as the crew members of the landing craft.
He stated, “I'm excited, it is the only way we can deliver to our people,"" Minister Soroi said.
Despite the bad weather, MV IBK arrived safely in Ihu on Friday, September 26. On board the barge were building materials that were delivered to Marea United Church.
The church plays a vital role not only in spreading the Gospel but also in housing and assisting People Living with Disability.
The building materials will be used to improve their facilities.
Getting assistance was also the Ihu High School, after being hard hit with food shortages in term 3. The rations come on time for boarding students and especially for grade 10s, who sit their exams in a few weeks.
Eoe said delivery of projects to Ihu, Baimuru, and Kikori had been a costly exercise for the Kikori District Development Authority over the years. Small dinghy vessels are hired to transport materials for project developments. As a result, project developments are quite slow
He said the road connection is only on the east side of the Gulf province, while the west part of the province is accessed by air and water. And MV IBK will operate as a passenger ship and, at the same time, help in the delivery of projects.
""One of the sad parts of life is that most of our people have lost their lives at sea.  “In this way, we can provide relief to our people. They can come as a passenger and bring their family from wherever they are.
""We have a chiller here. It is built into the ship. They can bring their crabs, fish, and everything, and preserve them on the ship.”"

“We must have a positive mindset and set our goals to achieve them. We may not be around to witness the next 50 years, but we must leave legacies behind for our children,” Soloma said.
As part of preparations for the 50th Independence anniversary, the Okapa District Development Authority (DDA) approved K2 million for celebrations.
Each secondary and high school in the district received K50,000, primary schools K5,000, church denominations K1,000, while public servants also shared in the allocation.
The 32 councilors each received K5,000 to celebrate with their people in their respective wards."
Election Materials for EHP Received and Secured,27/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6200,,Politics,Anticipation,Nill,"Eastern Highlands Province has received its election materials ahead of the upcoming Local-Level Government (LLG) elections, following their delivery by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Hercules aircraft on Friday afternoon.
The plane touched down at Goroka Airport at 3pm, where Provincial Election Manager Steven Gore Kaupa, his deputy Simon Parak, police officers, and Correctional Services staff were on hand to receive the cargo.
The materials were immediately transferred to the Goroka Provincial Police Station and secured in containers for safe keeping.
Kaupa said Eastern Highlands is ready to conduct the elections as planned, but delays ordered from higher authorities must be respected. “We are only implementors on the ground carrying out our mandated duties. I feel sorry for the councillors and the intending candidates but I can’t do much,” he said.

High management turnover at SOEs a concern,27/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6199,,Business,Frustration,Powes Parkop,"High staff turnover in the executive management of State-Owned Enterprises is contributing to the problems faced by SOEs like PNG Power and Water PNG, says NCD Governor Powes Parkop.
He made this comment on Thursday 25th September when addressing stakeholders from government departments, state-owned agencies as well as the private sector, during a gathering to find solutions to the ongoing power issues not just in Port Moresby but around the country as well.
Secretary for National Planning and Monitoring, Koney Samuel emphasized that for the country to achieve the goals of Vision 2050, there must be a sustainable energy system in the country.
“I don’t think we have put a lot of money into the energy sector and I think the coordination is very, very important and I can’t see any numbers here in terms of the issues that you have presented and what would be the cost of addressing those issues in the country and I’d been making some statements to restructure the budget. I think we have to put K1 billion in energy sector!
“The government must borrow but grant to PPL because PPL does not have capacity to repay the loan at this point in time. I think the government must take the leadership and provide some sufficient funding.”
He emphasized on a K1billion budget even if it means knocking on international lenders again, adding that ADB is willing to come on board as well as World Bank, JICA and other external sources.
NCD Governor Parkop highlighted the lack of stable governance as a contributing factor to the problems faced, noting the change of the PPL CEO 14 times since 2012. He urged decision makers to stop this kind of practice.
“If we keep high staff turnover at PNG Power and Water PNG how do we expect this strategic plan to be devised and for us to implement this plan?
“In PNG Power, I want to encourage you all to put a time line where we are going to get rid of all the back-up generators. If we can put a timeline to it and work towards it, that would be good for the city and good for Papua New Guinea.” Parkop said.
He said business houses must not be distracted by their standby generators. They must concentrate on their core business of making money and growing the economy and leave the energy issue to PNG Power Limited.
He suggested a timeline of 2027 for all major entities and business houses to stop using back-up generators."

The consultation outcomes will inform national drafting workshops and a final validation session."
PM Marape advocates for peace at UN meeting,27/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6204,,Global,Trust,James Marape,"In his address to the United Nation General Assembly, Prime Minister James Marape reiterated the message of peace as the world is faced with various conflicts.
He presented the Bougainville conflict as an example of how peace can be reached through dialogue and consensus.
“In fact, 14 years after independence in 1975, Bougainville Island in our country suffered extreme violence. But through dialogue and the oversight of the United Nations, we've achieved the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement. And since then, I am happy to say not a bullet has been fired since the peace agreement was signed.
“We continue to resolve questions around Bougainville's future through dialogue, our Melanesian conscience, our Christian brotherhood sitting together on the table, and through our consensual process. I want to say Bougainville reminds us that peace can be achieved.”
He made particular mention of the Israel Gaza conflict, pledging PNG’s allegiance to Israel and calling on Gaza to come to the “peace table”.
“This morning I was pleased to hear Israel's Prime Minister saying for the first time, or in fact he's been saying with re-emphasis again this morning, that Hamas, if you let go (of) those who you capture, they could stop the war right now and then.
“And for Papua New Guinea as a friend of Israel, I want to say we will stand on Israel's word and ask them to come to the peace table if Hamas, you come out and stop the current war that is going on. Give peace a go,” Marape said.
The Prime Minister also reminded other nations in conflict that peace can be reached and PNG stands as a testimony to this process.
“And I want to ask, give peace a go, sit at the table of peace. That could be something that the world can learn from Papua New Guinea. After 10 years of civil conflict, we decided under UN supervision that we will give peace a go.
“24 years on, no bullet has been fired. We're working through the process. And I want to thank the Secretary General.”"
HWPL 11th World Peace Summit,26/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6188,,Peace,Trust,Nill,"Showcasing Achievements and Future Vision of Cooperation among International Organizations, Governments, and Civil Society for Peace, Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL), an international peace NGO based in South Korea, hosted the 11th Anniversary of the September 18th HWPL World Peace Summit on September 18–19 in Cheongju.
Under the theme “Uniting for Peace and Fulfilling Humanity’s Duty Together,” the commemoration will continue across 78 major cities worldwide through October.
This year’s summit gathered more than 800 global leaders, including former and current presidents, prime ministers, speakers of parliament, chief justices, cabinet ministers, and leaders in education, religion, media, and youth sectors, who voluntarily traveled to Korea, demonstrating expanding global support for HWPL’s peace initiatives.
Since the inaugural HWPL World Peace Summit in 2014, the organization has pledged practical approaches for conflict resolution through international law, interfaith cooperation, and peace education.
At this 11th anniversary, HWPL presented its key achievements from the past year, notably the development of public–private partnership models for embedding sustainable peace within diverse national contexts.
A central agenda item was the global expansion of support for the Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW), HWPL’s proposed legal framework to end wars and establish lasting peace. The DPCW sets out principles such as the prohibition of the use of force, conflict prevention and mediation, and ensuring sustainable peace.
Chairman Lee Manhee of HWPL emphasized global cooperation for peace, saying, ""Conflict can never be good. Only the achievement of peace is truly good. If we fail to establish a peaceful world in our time, we will burden future generations with conflict. What we leave behind must be a world of peace, not one of conflict.""
While the Cheongju summit served as the centerpiece, HWPL emphasized that anniversary events will continue in 78 countries through October.
More than 15,000 leaders from international organizations, governments, and civil society are expected to participate in in-depth discussions on long-term strategies for sustainable peace, tailored to their respective national contexts.
Since 2023, the HWPL International Religious Peace Academy has been implemented as an interfaith learning program, formally recognized in several countries as a platform for leaders and citizens to engage in peace-centered dialogue."
Parties overlooked education calendar,26/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6193,,Politics,Frustration,Nill,"A simple oversight by the Electoral Commission to consult the calendars of the different government departments to ensure elections do not fall on department sanctioned dates has now led to another delay of the 2025 LLG elections.
Despite being well prepared to go for polling tomorrow, the Electoral Commission has taken responsibility for its oversight in not consulting the education calendar before locking in the dates for LLG elections. He explained how the whole process would have been still delayed even if they had factored the exams into the schedule.
“I would like to admit that we overlooked the exam period that consistently have had over years, past and today. There is no excuse about it. So, when you look at it, presidents, councillors and supporters and everybody, public servants, our own staff on the ground, if we would have run the elections last time, it would be still the same. October would have been omitted. I have now come to realize. In previous elections, we never extend, so I never went down to October. We deliver and return in July.
“So, the education department going to exams and all of this was a normal thing. Now, it clashes with the election date and this time I was surprised. So, without knowing the exam time and we already set the date, now the education minister comes up and says the exam time is here,” Electoral Commissioner Simon Sinai explained.
However he reaffirmed EC’s commitment to this constitutional process and confirmed the start of the new polling date for 25 October 2025.
Having deferred LLG elections more than once, the Electoral Commission and the Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs were ready to go out and start polling tomorrow.
However, the decision to delay this constitutional process was done considering the national exams.
He urged everyone, especially the candidates to remain steadfast and resilient.
“So we wish to appeal to our people, the contestants and the election staff, appointed returning officers, assistant returning officers, polling clerks, team members, provincial administration, administrators, deputy administrators, advisors, women groups and youth groups who are involved one way or the other from election activity from day one to today, our apology.
“We apologize, may you accept our apology and cooperate to work together.”
And while polling is further delayed, Sinai also expressed concerns about remote areas where polling materials and staff have already been deployed but might not have received news of the deferral.
He said with writs already issued, there would not be any implications if they went ahead with polling.
“To the rest of Papua New Guinea, our teams were ready. You see, we don't have all our senior staff here. They are already in Tari, they are in Madang, they are in New Island, they are in Rabaul, Manus, everywhere already.
“We got the money out of the banks already and some remote parts they already left. Today, they might not know this and they already would be doing polling tomorrow or on Monday.
“If they do polling, we're still within the law, let them do it. But obviously, with respect to the exams, we will delay the election.”
The new dates for this election will be announced in the next few days."
LLG polling deferred to October 25,25/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6173,,Politics,Trust,"John Rosso, Lucas Dekena, Richard Masere","Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Constitutional Matters, Richard Masere, this morning told this newsroom that an official statement on the outcome of the Local Level Government elections will come from the Acting Prime Minister, John Rosso, and Minister for Education, Lucas Dekena.
According to a statement circulating on social media, the Government has resolved to address the date clashes between the Local Level Government (LLG) election polling and the National Examination schedule.
Leaders on Government forums raised concerns regarding the overlap between these two important national events.
The statement indicated that two separate meetings were convened, attended by the Acting Prime Minister, Minister for Education, Minister for Police, Minister for Administrative Services, and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Constitutional Matters, the Chief Secretary, State Solicitor, and the Electoral Commissioner.
The LLG polling and counting were initially set for September 27 to October 17, while the National Examinations for Grades 8, 10, and 12 were scheduled for October 6 to 24. This overlap posed a significant challenge.
After careful deliberation, the Government resolved that while the LLG elections are a vital constitutional process, the education of our children must take precedence.
Any deferral of national examinations would create a ripple effect on marking, selection processes and admissions into higher learning institutions, directly affecting the future of students.
A consensus was reached to retain the national examination dates as planned, while deferring the LLG polling to October 25, 2025.
The Electoral Commissioner will shortly announce the revised polling, counting, and return-of-writs dates.
This decision was made in the best interest of ensuring that both the examinations and the elections proceed smoothly and successfully. Official statements from the Acting Prime Minister and the Minister for Education will follow.
Confirmed National Examination Dates:
Grade 10: October 6-10
Grade 12: October 13 – 17
Grade 8: October 20 – 24"
Sonk withdraws court proceedings,25/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6169,,Business,Trust,Nill,"The Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) Board today welcomed the withdrawal of two applications before the courts, allowing them to proceed unhindered in their assigned roles, responsibilities, and decisions as noted in their instrument of appointment.
They also extended thanks to suspended KPHL Managing Director Wapu Sonk and his lawyers for taking this course of action of withdrawing the court proceedings filed last Friday and on Sunday.
Mr Sonk filed two applications - the Friday one challenging the appointment of the new KPHL Board and the Sunday one challenging his suspension as KPHL Managing Director.
Board Chairman Gerea Aopi said, ""The Board resolution to suspend Mr Sonk as KPHL Managing Director and appoint Luke Liria as acting MD was not malicious in intent but administrative: to ensure integrity of process both for KPHL in ensuring good governance principle of transparency and accountability; and for Mr Sonk as he addresses his personal issues.""
""Justice as we all know, must not only be done, but seen to be done, both in KPHL's case as PNG's leading multi-billion State company involved in oil and gas sector in PNG and abroad; and in the case of Mr Sonk as the pioneer and leading chief executive of KPHL over allegations of impropriety published initially in the Australian press.""
Aopi said whatever perceptions and public opinion may be, only courts of law can ascertain guilt or otherwise. He added that Mr Sonk is therefore innocent as far as the law and the Board are concerned.
The withdrawal of the applications by agreement, endorsed by the courts today, effectively means a halt to the challenges on the appointment of the current KPHL Board led by Chairman Aopi; and the Board's unanimous decision on suspension of Mr Sonk as Managing Director and Luke Liria as Acting Managing Director.
""To expedite the removal of this cloud hanging over KPHL and Mr Sonk, what really needs to happen is for an independent investigation and necessary court action on the alleged matters now in the public. Any court challenges in relation to the appointment of the new KPHL Board of Directors will only result in unnecessary delays and accumulated legal fees while the substantive matter of the allegations remains unresolved,” Aopi added."
PPL told to fix aging blackouts,25/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6185,,Nation,Frustration,Powes Parkop,"As the country marked 50 years of Independence on September 16, most parts of the city were in the dark as power blackouts hit again, affecting city residents and vital services.
The power supply issue in the nation's capital is a never-ending story. The experience of last week has brought PNG Power Ltd (PPL) into the spotlight.
Today, in a meeting with PPL management, NCD Governor Powes Parkop told PPL to take action and resolve the prolonged blackout during the 50th Independence anniversary celebrations, the past and ongoing power crisis.
Parkop called an urgent meeting with leaders from the government and corporate sectors for an impromptu consultation to find solutions and end PPL’s power supply issues once and for all.
They expressed concern about the unacceptable norm of constant blackout both in Port Moresby and around the country.
Parkop said constant power blackouts have affected businesses, hospital operations, police operations, and other important operations.
“We all know that our country can’t go forward and cannot progress without these basic services. Government department needs it, businesses, and health need a reliable power supply to use their digital and AI technology for advancements. You cannot harness those without an affordable and reliable power supply,” Parkop said.
Several prominent people who participated in the discussions included senior members of NCDC, Department of Planning and Monitoring, Department of Personnel Management, Water PNG, Police, Port Moresby General Hospital, and the Department of Education.
Secretary for National Planning and Monitoring, Koney Samuel, firmly said that this problem faced by PPL is an ongoing issue over the years and needs to be resolved once and for all. He said there are funds to attempt solutions, either temporary or permanent.
Samuel urged the PPL management to seek assistance from the government to address this issue.
PNG Power Ltd chief executive officer, Paul Bayly, explained the issues that PNG Power is currently facing, which are causing the constant blackouts.
PPL says one contributing factor is the lack of water supply due to the long dry spell in the city. It highlighted that its critical power transformer breakdown also caused power interruptions. Bayly alluded to the fact that there are legacy issues that need to be resolved."

The Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government, Soroi Eoe, confirmed the change of date late this afternoon.
This change comes into place considering the National Examinations for Grades 8, 10, and 12, scheduled for October 6 to 24. This overlap posed a significant challenge.
Minister Eoe, in a statement, said the government's commitment to safeguarding the future of Papua New Guinea’s children by prioritizing their education during a critical national period.
A consensus was reached to retain the national examination dates as planned, while deferring the LLG polling to a later date.
Minister Eoe extended his gratitude to Deputy Prime Minister and Member for Lae, John Rosso, for his tireless consultations with key electoral stakeholders this week to address growing concerns about the potential disruption the upcoming LLG elections could pose to students sitting for national exams.
“As a government, we carry the dual responsibility of upholding the integrity of our elections while ensuring our children’s education is not compromised,” Minister Eoe stated. “Our young people are not just students—they are the future of this nation, and their exams must proceed without interference.”
Minister Eoe apologies to provincial administrations, candidates, and citizens who have worked diligently in preparation for the elections, acknowledging their efforts and sacrifices.
“The Electoral Commission is fully prepared to conduct polling, but we must first honour our duty to the next generation,” he said. “We cannot afford to jeopardise the future of our children.”

Minister Eoe also thanked the Electoral Commissioner for exercising his constitutional authority to delay polling to protect the integrity of the national exams and uphold the interests of the country’s youth."
Marape commends PNG Customs for confiscating undeclared cigarettes,25/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6181,,Government,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has commended the Papua New Guinea Customs Service (PNGCS) for its tireless efforts in safeguarding Papua New Guinea’s borders and making significant breakthroughs in the fight against Illicit Trade.
This follows the recent seizure of 3.5 million undeclared cigarette sticks, with an estimated street value of K3.54 million, at the Motukea Container Examination Facility (CEF) in July.
The illicit consignment was cleverly concealed in boxes falsely declared as ‘tissues’ but was detected through the vigilance and expertise of Customs officers, working in close collaboration with the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
The Prime Minister described the operation as a clear reflection of the progress PNGCS has made in reducing Illicit Tobacco and protecting the well-being of Papua New Guineans.
“I want to commend Chief Commissioner David Towe for his outstanding leadership and every hardworking officer of the Papua New Guinea Customs Service for their dedication. This successful seizure is not only a victory against smugglers but also a powerful reminder that PNG will not be a haven for Illicit Trade,” Marape said.
The Prime Minister also highlighted the broader economic and social impact of PNGCS’ enforcement efforts.
“By intercepting Illicit Tobacco, Customs is protecting the health of our people, ensuring Government revenue is safeguarded, and enabling legitimate businesses to thrive. Every stick of Illicit Tobacco taken off our streets is a win for our nation,” he said.
Independent studies previously showed that Illicit Tobacco accounted for between 36 to 40 percent of the PNG market in 2018–2019.
However, thanks to consistent enforcement and collaboration between Customs, Treasury, law enforcement agencies, and industry stakeholders, the market share of Illicit Tobacco dropped to less than 6 percent by 2023, with continued efforts being made till date to bring it even further down."

This follows attempts by an organised group to hold the nation to ransom through the blockade of this vital highway.
Police Commissioner David Manning said the security response was swift, with the roadway reopened over the past few days.
""The destruction of critical infrastructure, such as a major roadway, to compel government action is an act of terrorism,"" Commissioner Manning stated.
""The actions of this group are unacceptable and unlawful. Their actions in damaging critical infrastructure risk the lives of our communities, who rely upon this roadway for goods and services, as well as access to medical care.
""Terrorism, and those who use violent means against our people and nation, have no place in our Country. It is unacceptable, and it is being addressed decisively.""

""Calm was promptly restored over the weekend, and the highway was repaired. Those who sought to hold the nation to ransom are now the subject of ongoing counter-terrorism operations.
""The second phase of the operation is being implemented to address any remaining threats in this region.
""I have authorised the use of measures available under the Counter-Terrorism Act, and approved counter-terrorism operations to remove this threat to our national security.
""200 law enforcement personnel are deploying in Nipa-Kutubu and adjoining areas.
""These personnel are afforded the powers and protections of the Counter-Terrorism Act to undertake their duties, and do so with the full support of the Government.
""Surveillance, financial analysis, and targeted tactical operations are underway and will continue throughout this operation.
""These targeted operations not only address those responsible for these acts of terrorism, but also form part of our operations to provide a secure environment for our communities ahead of the 2027 National General Elections.
""This is part of a long-term commitment by Police and PNGDF to remove from our communities those who present a threat to the rule of law. This operation will continue over the coming months.""

"Refrain from committing crime, warns Manning",23/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6146,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"Committing a criminal offense is not the way we want to live our 50 years of independence; rather, abiding by the laws of our country is what we want to achieve, says Commissioner David Manning.
He made this statement in response to an illegal protest conducted by the community of Nipa, Southern Highlands Province, following the recent suspension of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Managing Director Wapo Sonk.
Commissioner Manning described the illegal protest as unlawful. He said the country has celebrated its 50 years of independence, and committing criminal offences is not the way the country should head.
“At some point, we have to realise that to live in a just, safe, and secure society, all of us need to be law-abiding citizens. There is no secret formula to it,” he said.
Manning said there are avenues to seek justice; taking matters into our own hands will not solve a problem.
He warned communities, especially in the Highlands region, that the Royal PNG Constabulary will not take matters lightly; it will rather use excessive force if citizens do not abide by the laws.
Meanwhile, the deployment of mobile squad units and members of the PNG Defence Force to Nipa has stopped the illegal protest from further escalating."

“I say thank you to you all. Continue doing the right thing.
“If you see a woman getting harassed, stop and belt that perpetrator. If you see someone throwing rubbish, say hey, don’t throw rubbish. People put in a lot of effort to clean the city up.
“Confront people who chew betelnut and spit the red juice on our new roads. Tell them, close your mouth and go spit into a rubbish bin.
“Little things count. And those little things make a great people; makes a great country.”
Rosso acknowledged the efforts of the city residents who align with his slogan #ForABetterLae, and urged everyone to continue supporting him as they work towards advancing PNG’s industrial hub."

The election was held at the INTERPOL Asian Region Conference in Singapore last week, which brought together police forces from 49 countries to discuss subjects including cybercrime, fugitive tracking, and child exploitation.
""As the largest Pacific Island Police Force, it was recognised that PNG provides significant input into regional security and combating cross-border crime,"" Commissioner Manning confirmed.
""Papua New Guinea's priority is to harness the power of regional collaboration to meet criminal threats to our communities.
""This increased engagement will enhance our capacity to intercept international criminals trying to exploit our country, while providing valuable input to Asia-Pacific law enforcement.
""The increased trafficking of drugs and weapons, and the laundering of money, poses a significant threat to the safety of communities across the Pacific and Asia.
""The fight against cyber-enabled child exploitation and other online criminal activity is another rising threat to our people.
""Papua New Guinea stands as the bridge between Asia and the Pacific, uniquely positioned to foster deeper, enhanced regional policing cooperation to target these criminals.""
Commissioner Manning said Assistant Commissioner of Police, Hodges Ette, will represent Papua New Guinea on this important INTERPOL committee.
""ACP Ette will represent PNG well at this high-level INTERPOL forum, and carry the respect of his international peers.""
""With many years of experience in front-line policing, ACP Ette has commanded complex investigations into transnational narcotic syndicates, money laundering, and child exploitation.""
The election of PNG to the INTERPOL Asian Region Committee followed a competitive process of voting by police forces from across the Asia-Pacific region.
Papua New Guinea is joined on the INTERPOL Asian Region Committee by Fiji, Australia, China, India, United Arab Emirates, Korea and the Philippines.
INTERPOL's Secretary General, Valdecy Urquiza, highlighted the importance of regional police co-operation to combat changing cross-border criminal activities.
""The threats we face today demand a faster, smarter and more united response,"" Secretary General Urquiza said.
""At the same time, the expertise, challenges, and needs of police across the region are many and varied.
""Gathering police leaders from across Asia, and beyond, is an opportunity to identify ways to build resilience and develop a common strategy to benefit the region in our shared mission to make the world a safer place,” Urquiza added."
Schnaubelt pushes for additional electorate,23/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6148,,Politics,Anticipation,"Richard Masere, Soroi Eoe, Walter Schnaubelt","The long-awaited push for the creation of the proposed Konos Open seat in the Sentral Niu Ailan Local Level Government (LLG) of Namatanai District is now before the National Executive Council (NEC) for review.
Namatanai MP and provincial member Walter Schnaubelt announced at a recent gathering in Konos, where excitement is building among the people.
“I am pleased to inform you that the Konos Open agenda is now officially before the NEC for consideration. This is a significant milestone, and I want to assure you that New Ireland has already met the requirements in terms of population size, landmass, and administrative capacity to qualify for its own open electorate,” Schnaubelt said.
He commended the Provincial Boundaries Committee for successfully delivering the proposal and ensuring all necessary documentation is in place. Schnaubelt confirmed that the NEC submission has been completed and is undergoing the vetting process before it is tabled for deliberation.
“I will do everything within my power and capacity to ensure Konos Open becomes a reality. I will actively engage my contacts and colleagues in the NEC to support this cause. Importantly, I enjoy very good working relationships with the responsible Ministers, Soroi Eoe - Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, and Richard Masere - Minister for Administrative Services, and I intend to utilize that to advance our agenda,” he said.
While optimistic, the Governor reminded the people that the matter must follow proper legal and constitutional processes, which takes time and called for patience and unity as the review progresses.
“Ultimately, our goal is to have Konos Open established before the 2027 General Elections. While this is the ideal outcome, we must also be realistic that the process may take longer. Regardless, I assure you that I will not give up until Konos Open becomes a reality,” he declared.
The proposed electorate would encompass Ramat to Bol on the east coast, Naiama to Kokola on the west coast, and the Tabar Islands within the Sentral Niu Ailan LLG. It would include the proposed Central East, Central West, and Tabar Group of Islands LLGs.
Konos is already well established with its own administration and council, and boasts existing facilities ready to serve as the foundation of a new electorate.
The Sentral Niu Ailan Rural LLG, with its headquarters in Konos, is the largest in Namatanai District, comprising 22 wards and an estimated population of 45,000—a strong and deserving candidate for parliamentary representation.
“This is not a political agenda of mine; this is about giving proper representation to the people of central New Ireland. Together, let’s remain patient, stay united, and trust the process,” Schnaubelt concluded."

"Safer seas, bigger catches",22/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6132,,Development,Joy,Nill,"Fishing families in East Sepik Province no longer have to endure long and costly trips to sea, thanks to a new initiative by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) under the EU-STREIT PNG Programme.
Seven inshore Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) have been deployed across seven fishing communities in Wewak District, directly benefitting more than 1,500 households and a combined population of about 9,000 people.
The FADs bring fishing grounds closer to the shore, reducing fuel costs, cutting travel times, and increasing catch rates—all while protecting fragile reef ecosystems.
On Wallis Island, the Fongkeleh Catches Business Group, made up of 150 members, including women, has already seen significant improvements.
Chairperson Sakias Nimehendu shared, “Our challenge when we didn’t have a FAD was that we troll for hours, wasting petrol, and sometimes returning with only 3 to 5 fish. Now, my catch has increased to over 100 fish for every fishing trip, and it takes less time.”
The initiative is part of FAO’s push to strengthen food security and livelihoods in island and coastal communities. Fisherfolk received training on sustainable FAD use, vessel safety, emergency procedures, and community-led monitoring to ensure long-term benefits.
Women, who play a central role in processing and selling fish, are also benefitting from shorter fishing times, giving them more time for both household and income-generating activities.
FAO Fisheries Officer Job Opu said the project was tailored to the needs of the communities themselves, ensuring easier access for small canoes. More FADs will be deployed across East and West Sepik in the coming weeks as the program continues."

Sonk questions legality of new KPHL board,20/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6121,,Politics,Anger,"James Marape, William Powi","The suspended Managing Director of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL), Wapu Sonk, is questioning the legality of the board that issued his suspension as their appointment is being contested in court by the former board.
Sonk claimed the board responsible for his suspension was “not correctly and legally appointed,” and said his suspension is done by a board that does not have legal standing.
He also revealed he had received two conflicting letters from two different boards — one suspending him and another confirming him in his role — therefore should wait for the courts to determine the legitimacy of the boards.
""Everyone, including [Police Commissioner] David Manning, should wait for the courts to determine which board I should take directions from,"" Sonk said.
Southern Highlands Governor William Powi, speaking to the media, strongly condemned Sonk’s suspension, calling it “an insult to the people of SHP.” Powi warned that the people would not take the matter lightly.
Supporters in Nipa-Kutubu, the home district of both Powi and Sonk, took to the streets in protest, demanding Sonk’s reinstatement.
Prime Minister James Marape addressed the issue, reaffirming his government's commitment to “transparency, accountability, and good governance.”
Marape clarified that he does not hold unilateral authority over the appointment of the KPHL board."
New Lae market set to open in 2027,20/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6123,,Development,Trust,John Rosso,"Australian High Commissioner Ewen McDonald and New Zealand High Commissioner Peter Zwart recently joined Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso in Morobe Province to celebrate the start of the construction of the new Lae Main Market.
The new market, set to open in early 2027, will house 1,300 vendors and 20 kiosks for small and medium enterprises in a modern, sustainable and inclusive facility. With improved hygiene, security and accessibility features, the market will support livelihoods and create economic opportunities across Morobe Province, particularly for women-led and family-run businesses.
The Lae Main Market redevelopment – jointly funded by the Australian Government, New Zealand Government, and Lae City Authority involved local stakeholders, businesses, community groups, and market vendors from the very beginning.
The new market’s design reflects the local environment and culture of the ten districts in Morobe Province. Sustainability features such as solar power and rainwater harvesting will build climate resilience and reduce operating costs. Built to Papua New Guinean, Australian, and New Zealand construction standards, the new market will serve the community for generations to come.
A temporary market was opened in May 2024 to allow vendors to continue to trade.
To ensure the new market is accessible to everyone, accessibility and inclusion principles have been integrated into every aspect of the project. Ramps and accessible toilets will provide people with disability access to all areas of the market. Improved security, including a police post, secure storage areas and solar security lighting, will improve safety for everyone, especially women and girls.
The project’s economic impact is already being felt far beyond the market gates. By purchasing materials and employing locally, the project continues to support local businesses and jobs."
Sonk suspended,19/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6101,,Business,Trust,James Marape,"Managing Director of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited, Wapu Sonk has been suspended by KPHL Board of Directors. This was announced in a media release issued by KPHL today. The Board has appointed Luke Liria as acting Managing Director.
Chairman Gerea Aopi said that this unanimous board resolution was necessary to protect the integrity of the KPHL Board and management.
Aopi stated, “The Board is aware of internal issues involving the Trustee/Shareholder, former Chairman and Directors, the managing director and the new Board, activities which have ended up in the National and Supreme Courts and affected the activities and operations of the KPHL Board
and management.”
He noted that the new Board had taken the view that in the interest of good governance and ethics
it was in the best interest of the KPHL to suspend Mr Sonk, to bring stability and integrity to the relationship between the new board and management of KPHL. Aopi added that the approach also allows Mr Sonk to address his personal issues.
“This resolution is the most significant made by the new KPHL Board after the Supreme Court’s ruling confirming their appointment by Prime Minister James Marape, as sole shareholder of KPHL on behalf of the State,” Aopi said.
The prime minister’s appointment of the new KPHL Board had been challenged in the National Court by outgoing Chairman Dr Benedict Yaru on behalf of his board members. The National Court, presided by Justice Pauline Bre on August 13 2025, ruled that Dr Yaru had no standing as his term had expired on September 2 2023.
Dr Yaru had appealed to the Supreme Court, presided by Justice David Cannings, who on August 25 2025 affirmed the National Court ruling of August 13 2025.
“Changes in boards when directors’ tenures expire is a standard practice in line with the Companies
Act and specific KPHL legislation. This has been tested – and confirmed in both the National Court
and Supreme Court in the case of the new KPHL Board,” Chairman Aopi said.
The new KPHL Board of Directors are Gerea Aopi (Chairman), Sandaram Srinivisan, Jacob Anga and George Gware.
“As a new Board we look forward to working with the KPHL management but the cloud of allegations
hanging over managing director, Mr Wapu Sonk, must be cleared transparently and expeditiously,
hence the Board resolution.”"

First AI usage to Detect TB in PNG,19/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6100,,Health,Trust,Nill,"In an important move to battle cancer in Papua New Guinea, Australia has partnered with other organisations to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) into tuberculosis (TB) care for mothers and children at Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH), a first of its kind in PNG.
PNG has one of the highest TB prevalence rates in the Western Pacific, with over 30,000 new cases annually.
With continued support from the Australian Government through the PNG-Aus Partnership’s Stop TB Partnership, a portable X-ray machine has been procured that utilises AI technology.
The initiative is derived through a collaboration between the University of Papua New Guinea’s School of Medicine and Health Sciences, the National TB Program, the PNG Obstetrics & Gynaecology Society, the Paediatric Society of PNG, National Capital District Provincial Health Authority (NCDPHA), World Vision International, and Baylor College of Medicine.
The AI tool, installed on a portable MinXray system, generates a TB risk score within seconds. Healthcare workers responsible for treating patients can review images and make informed decisions quickly.
Since acquiring the portable MinXray system with the (QureAI) AI tool installed in 2024, the investment has enabled the deployment of AI-assisted TB screening directly into POMGEN’s Maternity Wing, Radiology Department, and TB clinics.
The Australian Government is proud to be working alongside other initiatives that improve early detection, reduce diagnostic delays, and strengthen local capacity to combat TB."
Canada supports ‘One Health’ initiative,19/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6106,,Conservation,Joy,Nill,"The Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program (TKCP) is thrilled with the contribution from the High Commission of Canada for its ‘One Health’ program.
Through this contribution, TKCP will strengthen and expand on its collaboration with the Morobe and Madang Provincial Health Authorities and other health-focused organizations in Papua New Guinea to promote and facilitate the localization of the One Health approach throughout the YUS Conservation Area.
Due to the remoteness of the YUS area on PNG’s Huon Peninsula, the communities and families lack access to basic social services including medical care and health education.
Recognizing this need, TKCP adopted a holistic approach to environmental conservation and established its ‘One Health’ program, which empowers remote communities of YUS with knowledge, resources, skills and leadership to address common local health concerns such as nutrition, respiratory illness, hygiene and sanitation, and water quality and access through preventative measures and nature-based solutions in alignment with Papua New Guinea’s National Department of Health.
In 2024, TKCP conducted an extensive process for community dialogue and engagement throughout the YUS Conservation Area to gather feedback, recommendations, and ideas with regard to the management of the YUS Conservation Area and its associated benefits for local communities and customary landowners.
These consultations served to inform and guide TKCP’s re-design and re-launch of its ‘One Health’ programming, centered around partnership with the Morobe PHA, to address pressing health concerns for women and families in YUS while empowering local leadership to maintain the health of the YUS environment.
The Acting High Commissioner of Canada to PNG, Manon Dumas and Canada Fund for Local Initiatives Manager Alex Croyle were in Lae to meet with TKCP Executive Director, Modi Pontio to discuss the project.
“The long-term goal for this project is to empower YUS community members and health workers with the tools and knowledge to safeguard human health by maintaining the health of—and healthy interaction with—their local environment and natural resources,” said Ms Pontio, TKCP Executive Director.
“Through the help of this contribution, training of village birth attendants, distribution of ‘safe delivery kits’ and family planning educational talks will take place when our volunteer health professionals travel to YUS in November.
“Work is already underway with the Morobe Provincial Health Authority to establish an MOU that will allow us to better address the health needs of the YUS people,” she said.
“We are very excited and proud to be part of the work of this inspiring organization,” said Acting High Commissioner of Canada to PNG, Ms Dumas.
“The comprehensive approach that is adopted by the Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program is exemplary. Canada shares PNG’s commitment to biodiversity and we are looking forward to seeing the impact of this project,” she said."
PNG National Reset Convergence,19/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6098,,Religion,Trust,Nill,"A powerful, spirit-filled prayer convention entitled as “PNG National Reset Convergence” started Wednesday September 17, 2025 at the Reverend Sioni Kami Memorial Church (RSKMC) in Port Moresby. The Body of Christ with Chairman, Reverend Pastor Joseph Walters, invited prophets and apostles from Africa and the United States to pray over the land, and teach the church to take on the responsibility of healing the land and resetting the country for the next decade.
“The reason for bringing them is that they carry in their life different messages that the nation needs,” said Rev. Walters. “For example, apostle Julius Suubi just talked about the importance of prayer and breaking curses on our land and in our families and then prophet Cindy Jacob very much said the same thing.”
“There was a lot of prayers today believing that those words clearly from God, from the man and woman of God and our responses will start to affect the nation for the better.”
According to Rev. Walters the convergence was part of a longtime plan of the Body of Christ that started in 2024. It was to be part of this year’s 50th anniversary celebrations among several important leadup events.
Rev. Joseph Walters said this is the main event, which they refer to as, ‘’The National Reset Convergence’.
“We are believing as the people who pray and trust God, that our nation will change after 16th September we believe that our nation will have some changes and adjustments, rearrangements, for our nation and believe God for a new Papua New Guinea,” said Rev. Walters.
Thousands of prayer network members came from around the county and nearby Pacific Island countries to receive healing and deliverance. Through their teaching, both Apostle Julius and Prophet Cindy revealed some of the reasons why there is poverty, disease and lack of advancement in the country.
While sharing an experience on how several African countries were delivered and changed their status quo to prosperity, Prophet Cindy explained that they were led to deal with iniquities from the past before deliverance could take place in their individual lives as well as their families, tribes and the countries they belong to. She said their leaders have to take some major initiatives in order to cause the deliverance to begin.
The National Reset convergence ends Sunday evening September 21, with a crusade. The Body of Christ leaders are grateful for the presence of PM Marape on the opening night and hope to have him again on or before the closing night."

Prime Minister James Marape has urged Papua New Guineans to embrace unity, honesty, and a renewed commitment to service as the nation steps into its next 50 years.
The event carried deep historical resonance. Independence Hill was once again the stage where the nation’s red, black, and gold flag — adorned with the bird of paradise and Southern Cross — was hoisted to the sound of the national anthem.
Joining the celebrations were His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh, Pacific leaders, ambassadors, church dignitaries, and representatives of development partners. Members of the founding generation and families of past prime ministers were also present, visibly moved as the flag returned to the skies where they had first seen it raised in 1975.
For Prime Minister Marape, this moment was more than commemoration. It was, as he put it, “a time to reset our minds, our purposes, and our zeal” for the next era of national progress.
On stressing the birth of the nation, Prime Minister Marape paid tribute to the “Somare generation” led by Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, who, with his colleagues, navigated PNG into independence. He recognised Dr John Momis, Sir John Kaputin, Lady Veronica Somare, Lady Stella Chan, and families of other leaders who shaped the nation’s founding.
“Yet history shows Papua New Guineans never give up.”
“They were the greatest generation Papua New Guinea ever produced,” the Prime Minister said. “They dared to believe that a thousand tribes, speaking over 800 languages, could unite as one people, one nation, one country. Their achievement will never be repeated.”
The Prime Minister also acknowledged the role of missionaries, churches, and educators who laid the foundation for modern PNG.
“Papua New Guinea can claim its place as the last country on Earth to have received the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Since then, the church has been our moral anchor, shaping our education, health, and leadership systems,” he said.
He extended gratitude to Australia, describing the transition to independence as one rooted in respect and goodwill. He quoted Sir John Guise’s words of 1975: “We are lowering the Australian flag, not tearing it.”
Importantly, Prime Minister Marape saluted the “unsung heroes” of nationhood — public servants, teachers, health workers, police officers, defence personnel, and farmers. “You have served your flag well. You have honoured your Constitution. The last 50 years belong to you as much as to our leaders.”
The Prime Minister described PNG’s story since 1975 as a journey of resilience. Despite political instability in the first three decades, PNG preserved democracy while other nations faltered. Over time, infrastructure was built, schools expanded, and citizens began to excel internationally."
Taking a stand for referees,17/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6083,,Sports,Trust,Nill,"Queensland Rugby League continues to work closely with the Papua New Guinea Rugby Football League (PNGRFL), thanks to the ongoing partnership of PacificAus Sports, participating in a series of meetings in Port Moresby.
PacificAus Sports is an Australian Government sports diplomacy initiative creating opportunities for Pacific athletes, coaches, officials, and administrators to learn, grow, train, and play together.
As Papua New Guinea marks 50 years of independence, QRL’s General Manager of Community Rugby League, Adam Vanzanten, and Financial Controller, Aidan Wade, led discussions focused on building a game for the country’s next generation. It was sport diplomacy in action: positive relations delivering practical outcomes.
Both organisations have common challenges and complementary strengths. PNG’s community connection is extraordinary. Queensland’s club frameworks and volunteer systems are proven and ready to share. The commitment is to share knowledge openly, exchange what works, adapt it locally and measure results where the game is actually played and watched.
A clear priority emerged around match officials. Instead of ignoring the issue, both bodies agreed to lead on respect for referees because it is the foundation for a safe and enjoyable game.
The approach is optimistic and solutions-driven: set the standard, make it visible, and support officials so they stay.
Queensland’s measures are already in place and producing change. Under-18 referees wear green socks so crowds and team staff recognise they are minors. A respect round with reports of incidents dropping by about a third.
Ground managers in red vests having the authority to issue warnings or stop play when behaviour crosses the line. Public address announcements make it clear that poor spectator conduct brings club demerit points and potential suspension.
Most importantly coaches are accountable for the standard they set on the sideline, because their influence carries over to their team and their teams supporters.
Support continues beyond match day. QRL is building a full pathway for officials through referee coordinators and coach mentors, strong referee associations that provide voice and support, healthy match payments to attract new young referees, and regular courses that lift capability and confidence.
PNGRFL will follow suit by piloting a recruit, retain and plan model in selected districts, backed by shared templates and volunteer recruitment plans adapted from recent QRL workshops.
Next steps are defined and joint.
PNGRFL will implement referee support and match-day controls alongside coach education, while QRL provides ongoing guidance.
Behaviour and retention will be tracked together to refine and scale successful initiatives.
This is the power of diplomacy in rugby league: two neighbours comparing experiences, solving shared problems and setting a higher standard for officials and communities across the Pacific."

On Saturday, September 13, at the main church on Gabaka Street, Gordons, the Universal Church held a UniSocial event to support those who felt left behind.
Many homeless people and those rejected by their families and society, who couldn’t afford a proper meal in a day, were invited to share a meal on that day.
Bishop Jonathan preached the word of God, encouraging those present that no matter what they had done in their lives, God has not forgotten them. He said it is not by coincidence that they are in church at the time; it was God’s appointed time for them.
“Jeremiah 29:11 says, ‘For I know the thoughts I think towards you, says the Lord. Thoughts of peace, and not of evil. To give you a future and a hope.’
Apart from the feed, Bibles were also distributed to those who wanted them. They received both the physical food as well as the Word of God, as this is the work of the Universal Church, following in the words of Jesus Christ, ‘to love God and to love our neighbour as well as love ourselves’.
Those who turned up included youths who live on the streets in Boroko and its surroundings.
On the occasion, the church was also graced by the presence of BSP personnel from the Waigani Call centre to provide vital banking advice and banking requirements to those who needed it.

Canoes re-live history,13/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6040,,History,Joy,Nill,"The 23 canoes carrying the country’s provincial Evangelical Lutheran Church (ELC) and the PNG flags from Karkar Island to Madang have rekindled an old missionary history that would have been forgotten by the current generation.
During the canoes' stop at Siar village, the local Pastor Philip Takee of the ELC of St. Bergmann congregation retold to Katanabul Fishing Associations Darius Suari about the mission’s history and what had transpired back in 1899.
In 1899, Siar was the first mission station of ELC in Madang province, with missionary George Kunze heading the spread of the gospel within the province. Coincidentally in 1899, Kunze decided to travel the seas to the other side, to Karkar Island, to spread the Good News.
Kunze was accompanied by six clans from Waifun, Badalon, Lilung, Banablau, Mizimu, and Didfon of Siar village on two canoes, each containing six men. He landed on Patilo on October 19th and began his mission.
According to Ps. Takee, it is not by mistake that in the celebrations of the country’s 50th Golden Jubilee Independence Anniversary, canoes from Patilo village at Karkar Island followed the footsteps of their trade route but also carried back the word of the Lord as once missionary Kunze did. He acknowledged that this history was nearly forgotten, but thanks to the Katanabul Fishing Association, it has been reignited and retold to the current generation of Siar village.
On Friday, as the canoes bid farewell to long-tied relations of Siar village and thanked them for their hospitality, they looked back on how this memory would soon last for 50 more years to come. Not only have the stories come out to tell of their ancestral and marriage ties, they’ve also found the connection linking them through early missionary Kunze.
Slowly moving towards Krangket Island, the canoes stopped at each village within Siar to receive blessings for the next voyage destination. People bade farewell along with Ps. Takee is announcing their departure from the island communities.
Today will see the last leg of the 23 canoes to Madang’s Masin Gun or Tusbab Beach this afternoon, depending on the sea level."
New court complex restores confidence in justice system,13/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6045,,Law,Fear,Nill,"The opening of the new National and Supreme Court Complex this week is the pride of the country’s judiciary. It is a symbol of progress and instills confidence in the administration of justice, says the PNG Law Society.
Society president Hubert Namani said the new Court Complex must stand not only as a monument of progress, but as a mandate for justice. It must be a place where the Rule of Law is upheld without fear or favour, not only against the petty offender, but also against those who plunder the State, abuse public trust, and profit from impunity.
He said justice must not be selective; it must be firm, fair, and fearless.
Namani said 50 years ago, the challenges of corruption, poor governance, and lack of accountability remain, but the opening of the new courthouse serves as a reminder that these challenges can be managed.
“Our people continue to endure struggles that undermine the freedoms and rights enshrined in our Constitution. Violence and killings in parts of the country are tearing communities apart.
Sorcery-related violence, once thought to be confined to rural areas, has now reached Port Moresby, threatening to normalise barbaric acts at the heart of our nation. Without deterrence and the consistent enforcement of law, these atrocities will soon be at our very doorsteps.”
“Lawlessness, organised crime, and tribal fighting continue to escalate. At the same time, basic social services are collapsing under the weight of neglect. Our hospitals run out of medicine, our schools lack resources, and our young people are left without opportunities to contribute meaningfully to nation-building. These are not coincidences; they are the inevitable consequences of systemic failures and, above all, the cancer of corruption,” he said.
Namani reminded the legal practitioners that they are the guardians of justice; they must lead with confidence, integrity, accountability, and courage to rebuild confidence in the judiciary and restore hope. Ensuring that justice prevail and gives Papua New Guineans access to the rule of law."

He said the opening serves as a reminder to the current and future governments about the importance of investing in the judiciary’s capabilities.
“In the modest houses, in rundown facilities, the judiciary was formed and preserved, and today this marks a starting point for the government of today and the government of the future to commit resources to maintaining the judiciary into the future,” he said.
Marape said PNG’s population has grown, leading to more complexity in court cases, of which the opening of the new courthouse is a step to addressing this issue.
Marape further thanked the past and current governments for investing in the judiciary, and called for more support for this important arm of government."

Highlands Florists Bring Colour,12/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6026,,Culture,Joy,Nill,"Florists from the Highlands are set to make their debut at the National Orchid and Flower Show in a vibrant celebration of Papua New Guinea’s floral heritage.
The event will take place over the weekend, September 13 - 14, in front of Parliament House.
This year’s National Orchid and Flower Show, now open to the public with free entry, features the newly unveiled Sir Rabbie L. Namaliu Orchid Gardens, a stunning display of orchids, Everlasting Daisies, and Bird of Paradise arrangements that honor both botanical beauty and national pride.
For the first time, florists from Eastern Highlands, Chimbu, Jiwaka, and Western Highlands will showcase their creations alongside seasoned growers from the nation’s capital. Their contributions include flower dresses, statues crafted entirely from blooms, and regionally distinct arrangements sourced from Mt Hagen and Mt Wilhelm.
Goroka, long known as PNG’s “flower town,” is at the heart of this movement. Local growers have built supply chains reaching Buka, Kimbe, and Port Moresby, turning floriculture into a viable small business sector. Many of the participating florists are single parents who rely on flower sales for income, demonstrating the economic potential of this often-overlooked industry.
Among the voices leading this floral renaissance is Ms. Keryn Hargreaves, whose personal journey with flowers began as a form of healing and grew into a passion for empowering others. “Flowers are more than decoration,” she says. “They’re a source of dignity, therapy, and livelihood.”
The Sir Rabbie L. Namaliu Orchid Gardens, named in honor of the late statesman, offer a serene backdrop for this showcase. Neatly arranged beds and decorative elements invite visitors to explore PNG’s botanical diversity while celebrating the legacy of a leader who valued national unity and cultural expression.
Organizers hope the event will inspire more Papua New Guineans to see floriculture not just as a hobby, but as a pathway to economic resilience and creative pride.

23 Karkar canoes on a mission,12/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6033,,Culture,Joy,Nill,"The Karkar community of Patilo village, Madang province, is proud to participate in the upcoming 50th Golden Jubilee Independence celebrations. The island community recently set sail 23 canoes representing the 22 provinces, showcasing unity and one PNG.
The canoes are estimated to reach Madang town on Saturday, September 13. The route currently taken is a traditional canoe trade route. They have a purpose for this travel – to raise awareness against law-and-order issues through the word of God.
The 23 canoes departed Karkar Island on Saturday, September 6, destined for Madang’s provincial capital, to participate in the province’s main independence celebration.
The traveling party braved the braved the ghastly Southern Easterly winds. While some went off course, everyone regrouped on Sunday at Rempi Village and paddled on.
Battered and strained from the challenging weather conditions, they progressed to Riwo Village and and then Siar on Thursday.
Today, they descended on Krangket Island for a nightcap.
Tomorrow, they reach their destination, the Tusbab Beach.
These canoes relive the ancestral trade routes and at the same time are on a mission to spread the gospel to trading villages as they pass on.
Katanabul Fishing Association chairman, Darius Suari said his fishermen started this initiative as a way to showcase celebrations not only on land but at sea as well.
Suari hopes that their drama and sharing of the Lord’s word can infiltrate the youth’s minds during this festive season to change for the next 50 years on. It will also go down in history as one of the first of its kind in the country where the gospel travelled over miles from the island to reach the mainland.
It is anticipated that upon their arrival on the 13th at Tusbab beach, they will sell their canoes for their SME projects as fishermen. They rely solely on fish, and their challenge of self-sustainability and food security remains an issue that they struggle to meet.
Community leader of the island, Artis Deme, was steadfast in his support during the Association’s initiative to carve out canoes for the event, supporting them during the camping period. During the launch of the canoes, he advised young fishermen and other community youths to learn from this event and start changing their mindsets for a better island and province.
Deme challenged them to look beyond their challenges and learn as much as they can from ancestral history to survive the trying times. On the mainland, he also delivered rations for the paddlers when they stopped over at each location.
Karkar islanders voiced patriotism and will showcase unity as PNG celebrates 50 years of independence, despite the country’s many challenges."
Lae police issue firm warning,11/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6009,,Local,Fear,Nill,"Individuals looking to cause trouble in Lae, Morobe Province, can do so “at their own risk”.
Lae metropolitan superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, has issued a reminder to residents who have forgotten how Lae police dealt with the unrest in January 11th, 2024 - a spill over from the January 10th rampage in Port Moresby.
A message was recently circulated on social media about a proposed nationwide protest and looting by unemployed youths during independence celebrations.
Kunyanban gave the assurance that police in Lae will not tolerate disorder in the city.
“And for Lae, let me put it this way: You have seen what had happened on Black Wednesday and you know the potential of Lae. Let me remind you; if you try it, it’s at your own risk because we have a mandatory duty to protect lives and properties of this country, and especially Lae,” said the Metropolitan Superintendent.
“As long as I’m the Met Sup, I will make sure that I will protect the lives and properties of people living in Lae.
“So, if you’re trying to disrupt or trying to do anything stupid, my advice is; don’t do it because Tok Pisin yumi save tok ‘Gavman gat longpla han’. You can’t destroy anything and go back and relax because we will still come after you, unless you have a rocket to go to the moon then we can’t catch up to you.”
Meantime, a number of major celebratory activities are planned for Lae, starting this weekend with the 62nd Morobe Show, then the float parade on Monday, September 15th, and major celebrations around the city on September 16th.
The police, Correctional Services and PNG Defence Force will be working in collaboration to ensure city residents have a safe and peaceful Independence week."

Code named “Golden Jubilee” the independence operation for the province was launched early this week with a parade.
Police will work hand in hand with the other disciplined forces and members of the public to combat illegal activities and fight crime.
Provincial Police Commander Acting Superintendent Robert Baim  said police will come hard on perpetrators of violence and crime during this festive period.

1.	Illegal Alcohol: If caught brewing, selling or consuming illegal homebrewed alcohol (steam), you will be arrested on the spot and immediately locked up in the cells.
The set bail fee for release is K5,000. There is no negotiation. There is no lesser amount. This is a direct measure to curb the violence, domestic abuse and public disorder that directly results from the consumption of these dangerous substances.
2.	Noise Pollution: A strict curfew on excessive noise is now in effect. Anyone caught playing loud music, causing loud noise pollution or disturbing the peace after 10pm will be arrested and locked up.
The set bail fee for release is K5,000. This is mandatory and non-negotiable. “We respect celebration but we will not tolerate all-night noise that deprives others of their right to peace, especially families with children and the elderly.”
“This is a warning, do not test our resolve. Our officers are deployed and have been directed to enforce these laws to the fullest extent. The goal is not to collect money but to ensure every single person in Madang can enjoy this historic celebration with pride and without fear,” PPC Baim stated.
As an additional security mechanism, the water police and community policing units will be conducting night sea patrols to ensure that no stone is left unturned.
According to PPC Baim, anyone caught with transporting illicit substances will face severe penalties with their outboard dinghies to be locked up and restricted from use until after the celebrations are over.
“This is part of ongoing efforts to ensure peace, safety and order leading into the 50th independence celebrations. Stay safe, obey the law and respect your community,” said Baim.
Currently, the people of Madang are enjoying the patriotic vibe set by the Madang Provincial Events Committee with the beautification of the town and many mini-events which has kept people busy as they wait for the main event.

Mainge Clans Protect Land,11/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6014,,Environment,Joy,Nill,"The Mainge Community in Melkoi LLG, Pomio District of East New Britain Province, has made history by launching its Sustainable Land Use Plan (SLUP) and signing a Conservation Deed on September 2, 2025.
Six landowning clans united in a symbolic ceremony to protect their customary land and natural resources after more than 15 years of environmental destruction from logging and palm oil projects. The Conservation Deed, a legally binding document, now ensures long-term protection of Mainge’s forests, rivers, and biodiversity.
Community Leader Leslie Alimba, who has led efforts to resist destructive development for years, said, “This move to protect the land is not for my personal interest and benefit, it’s for all the clans, all community members, and the future generations. As the theme says, my land is my life.
God created the environment, land and waters so we have to protect it. As a leader, I have to do everything for the good of my people.”
He added, “Today is historical for the survival of the future. We should not think about money and destroy our land. The money we receive today will be gone tomorrow and we will become slaves in our own land.”
FORCERT Manager, Cosmas Makamet, emphasized that Mainge’s land falls under the Special Agriculture and Business Lease (SABL), Portion 198c of the Nakiura Concession area. He explained, “Your land is under a SABL and with the signing today, you take a step towards reclaiming your customary land from the SABL. The Sustainable Land Use Plan, laws, penalties and the Conservation Deed signed today takes effect immediately to protect your land and environment.”
He warned that selling land for immediate profit jeopardizes the future: “If you sell your land, the money you received will vanish and your children and grandchildren will have no land to make gardens and build homes.”
World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Pomio Project Officer, Oscar Pileng, reinforced that the SLUP and Conservation Deed empower communities to sustainably plan and manage their land, not only for conservation but also for responsible development and economic opportunities.
Pomio District Electoral Officer, Chris Atung, commended the community’s resilience, while neighboring leaders from Atu, Mauna, and Kerengkorona Wards witnessed the event alongside FORCERT, WWF, and Wok Strongim Community Program Officers.
In a strong show of unity, both male and female representatives from each clan signed the Conservation Deed. The ceremony concluded with the joint unveiling of the SLUP by the Pomio District Electoral Officer and FORCERT Manager. Guests were later treated to fresh garden produce as a token of appreciation from the community."

As person in charge of nurses nationwide, he sympathized with Madang nurses and has called on the Provincial Health Authority, the Governor and members of each district in the province and the National Government to urgently look into the plight of the hospital."

Addressing the Heads of the Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP), Minister Jelta Wong highlighted the urgent need for tangible collaboration to protect Pacific people and their way of life, including strengthening the surveillance and security of maritime borders.
He underscored that while collaboration is frequently discussed, it often lacks real-world implementation.
""We need to move past rhetoric and turn our ideas into action,"" Minister Wong stated. ""The alarming rise of methamphetamine in our region is a critical issue that requires immediate and serious attention.""
He cited the challenges faced by Pacific nations in implementing initiatives, such as the East New Britain Initiative, due to interventions from large international fishing interests. ""We have to work harder to implement our interventions,"" he said.
Minister Wong also acknowledged the work of Dr. Stuart Minchin, Director General of the South Pacific Community, for his efforts to support people with disabilities, calling it a significant social issue that impacts every country in the region.
However, he returned to the threat of methamphetamine, calling it a detrimental social issue that is often overlooked.
He warned that if the region does not tackle the drug problem now, it will have far-reaching consequences.
""We have small populations, and the reality of rising methamphetamine use throughout our region means we could lose our people, our traditions, and our cultures because of this one synthetic drug that we are unable to control,"" Minister Wong concluded.
The Pacific Islands Forum is the region’s premier political and economic policy organization. It brings together leaders from across the Pacific to address critical issues and promote cooperation."
Historic aircraft to be preserved,9/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5991,,Culture,Trust,Thomas Opa,"Papua New Guinea’s aviation heritage can now be proudly displayed following the opening of a purpose-built Aviation Heritage Centre at the Papua New Guinea National Museum and Art Gallery in Port Moresby.
The new facility, opened by Papua New Guinea's Minister for Finance, Thomas Opa MP and Australia’s Chief of Air Force Air Marshal Stephen Chappell DSC CSC OAM, provides a permanent home for the museum’s World War Two-era Douglas A-20 Havoc bomber and other historic Papua New Guinean aircraft and Royal Australian Air Force Wirraway aircraft.
The centre was built as a collaboration between the Royal Australian Air Force and the Papua New Guinea National Museum and Art Gallery, seeking to provide an appropriate home for historic aircraft of mutual significance to Australia and Papua New Guinea for years to come.
Rodney Graham, a Port Moresby resident, helped install many of the new Centre’s exhibitions, with his company – Rods Construction Ltd – utilising cranes and forklifts to set the items in place. The project has contributed PGK39 million (AUD14m) to the local economy since 2023.
For Mr. Graham, the new Centre ensures that his, and future generations, are reminded of the sacrifices of the past and the shared history between Australia and Papua New Guinea.
“I wasn’t born when these things happened and this Centre helps us to think of our history – our shared history – and the things that happened long ago,” Mr. Graham said.
“It means a lot to be invited to be here, and to be involved in a milestone event for Papua New Guinea.”
For Air Marshal Chappell, the Centre is reminiscent of Papua New Guinea and Australia’s defence relationship.
“The Aviation Heritage Centre and the World War Two-era Douglas A-20 Havoc Bomber stand as a permanent reminder of an enduring defence relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea, forged through shared tenacity and sacrifice during World War Two,” Air Marshal Chappell said.
“The opening of this purpose-built facility acknowledges and celebrates the work being undertaken to safeguard and celebrate Papua New Guinea’s aviation history and heritage.”
“This Aviation Centre is a gift of friendship - thank you for being a good friend to us, for always showing up for us and your mutual respect.”
The Centre already has a new addition, with Air Marshal Chappell providing a new exhibition at the opening.
He presented pictorial history books and photos taken of Papua New Guinea’s Douglas DC3s in the mid-1970s by the first Commanding Officer of the Air Transport Squadron – William “Stew” McAllister – to the current Papua New Guinea Defence Force Air Transport Wing Commanding Officer Lt Col Douglas Vavar and Director of Air Operations, Lieutenant Colonel Nancy Wii.
The Papua New Guinea Defence Force, the Royal Australian Air Force and Papua New Guinea National Museum and Art Gallery continue to work together to ensure the ongoing preservation and display of aviation artefacts of mutual interest.

Muruks return to the big dance,9/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5976,,Sports,Joy,Nill,"Pride of Southern Highlands, the PRK Mendi Muruks overpowered long-time arch rivals, ENB Agmark Gurias, to a 20-12 victory in a thrilling preliminary final clash to secure a spot in the 2025 Digicel ExxonMobil Cup grand final.
Sunday’s victory was a defining moment for Muruks, ending their 13-year drought since their last grand final appearance in 2012 against the Gurias, where they lost 10-14.
After going down to Lae Snax Tigers in the major semi-final a week earlier, the Rodrick Puname-coached side played a more controlled and disciplined game with few errors.
Gurias, on the other hand, started on the wrong foot with too many errors, mainly in their attacking sets, and a breakdown in their defensive structure allowed Muruks to capitalize on for much-needed points.
Muruks set their platform early when Jade Puk opened the Gurias' middle defense to send Victor Ario for the opening try in the 12th minute to take the lead 6-0. Gurias came into play later in the end when winger Myles Banam scored a four-pointer at the 31st minute to trail 4-6.
Muruks continued their dominance in the first half with Lega Batia crossing just before half time to score to extend the lead 12-4.
Muruks continued their tempo in the second when hooker Jerry Joe exploded out of dummy half to catch the Gurias defense of guard to put his team further in front in the 43rd minute before Batia again showcased his attacking prowess when he skipped passed Gurias defense to put the case beyond reach at 20 -4.
A late surge by Gurias did not threaten the Muruks' line until the dying minutes of the second half, when they scored two tries in quick succession through Banam and Emil Benjamin, but it was too little too late at the sound of the final siren."

Acting CIS Commissioner meets Beon inmates,9/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5983,,Local,Sadness,Nill,"As the country prepares to celebrate the 50th Golden Jubilee, prisoners throughout the country will observe this day in a closed facility, away from family and friends.
Acting Correctional Service Commissioner Bernard Nepo in a special visit to the Beon Correctinal facility yesterday (08 September) wept openly, reassuring prisoners of their dignity as human beings and as citizens of PNG and not to allow the walls to confine their views of the outside world.
He told the inmates that regardless of their offenses, they remain Papua New Guineans and are brothers, fathers and sons to someone.
Nepo was at the maximum-security unit, updating the inmates about changes taking within CIS and how it will help to rehabilitate them to be good citizens after they leave.
These changes will be implemented nationwide and Nepo emphasized that the institution was there to assist them get back up on their feet and eventually they will have to go back into the society reformed.
The first program that will be embarked on is the Technical & Vocational Education Training (TVET) program following the signing  of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Education department last month. This will enable an effective rehabilitation program for the prisoners in skills training.
Acting Commissioner Nepo advised the prisoners that they will undergo skills training and later be engaged with organizations with their salaries to be credited directly to their bank accounts whilst they are still in captivity. Their entitlements will be given to them along with their certificates and tools when they are released into society, giving them an opportunity to thrive again and a chance at employment.

Campaign against ‘OBT’,8/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5968,,Crime,Anger,Nill,"The landowners of Lae city are taking a stand against the unpopular criminal trend called ‘Operesen Brukim Tulait’, or OBT, by identifying those involved and handing them to police.
Butibam’s deputy chairman and secretary for the Council of Chiefs, Gibing Jethro, said they are frustrated as they cannot live and move around freely on their own land.
Butibam village has been reporting incidences of ‘OBT robberies for the past two months. Different communities have different versions of OBT Gangs. However, the gang’s strategy is to overwhelm their victims through sheer number – most numbering over 50 – and attacking after midnight.
Youth from the village have been vigilantly patrolling their respective areas since the last major break-and-enter in August that saw over 50 men break into a home at 2am, holding an elderly woman and her grandchildren at gunpoint while they ransacked the place.
On the night of Wednesday, September 3rd, over 15 armed men held up a company drop-off vehicle along Awagasi and Asu Talair. Butibam villagers managed to apprehend and beat up three of the suspects before handing them to police early the next day. Butibam’s deputy chairman expressed their frustration at the growing crime rate that has made even landowners feel unsafe.
“It was happening to other people outside, we were concerned until it happened right in our village,” he stated. “In our village, they came in and this elderly woman was sitting and shaking; that incident has infuriated us. You can see the frustration we had, and we recently demonstrated that.”
“As landowners, we condemn this criminal trend and we’ve already taken some measures, in collaboration with the police.
“The leaders have agreed to the concept of eviction into the communities. Those settling on our land, if we find out – and surely, we will – that you are involved in these illegal activities in our village or city, we will not hesitate. We will identify their areas and move with police and we will forcefully evict them.
“We are in our village; it’s a very good place. We are a peace-loving people and we have even given land to people to settle. We will be celebrating 50 years of independence for our country and we want to ensure that our village is safe and secure.”
Jethro emphasised that the village is in agreement to take bold steps to address the OBT issue.
When commending Butibam, Lae metropolitan superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, called on other communities to come together to fight this issue.
“If you really look at it, it’s only a minor group in the community that’s causing problems. Liklik grup tasol and we can handle them! Who are they?
“I’d like the community to take responsibility of this and be part of it to address this issue. But we, police, will stand to help them.”"

""Happy Father's Day to all the Fathers in our country today. May God bless you all, and May God bless Papua New Guinea."""

As PNG reflects on its 50 years of nationhood, the school community looks ahead with renewed commitment to education and nation building."
Finance Department migrates to Electronic Funds Transfer,6/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5948,,Business,Trust,Nill,"The use of government cheques is slowly being phased out as the Department of Finance migrates to automated Electronic Funds Transfer service.
A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Department of Finance and the BSP Financial Group on Thursday, 04 September 2025 to signify this.
The MOU signing will now see the commencement of this service on Monday, 08th September 2025.
BSP Chief Operating Officer, Nuni Kulu said the initiative aligns with Government’s broader strategy to eliminate the use of cheques and move towards a modern, sustainable, paperless financial ecosystem.
The EFT service is developed in harmony with the PNG Government Medium Term Development Plan IV and the Public Finance Management Act, and will replace the use of government cheques with digital platforms that offer real-time secure electronic payments. This means government agencies, suppliers, and contractors can now receive payments faster, more reliably, and with greater visibility on transactions.
BSP Chief Operating Officer, Nuni Kulu said “EFT payments benefit all segments involved in transactions with the government, including consumers, businesses, and communities. The service improves security, efficiency, and speed for both the government and the recipients of its payments.” Timely cashflow cycles improves certainty and confidence in doing business with government,” she added.
Beyond speed and convenience, the EFT service will also enhance transparency and accountability in public finance management.
Real-time electronic records strengthen auditability and reduce the risk of fraud or human error often associated with manual cheque handling.
“BSP is proud to support the Government in building a system that benefits everyday Papua New Guineans. Together, we are creating a stronger foundation for financial inclusion, transparency, and better service delivery,” she added.

Govt department partners NCD Police,5/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5935,,Security,Trust,Nill,"The Department for Community Development and Religion will work closely with the police to support safe city operations.
NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab said the objective of this partnership is to keep the city safe through a team effort, as the police cannot do it alone.
He said the NCD command has engaged the department because most of their employees, including Secretary Jerry Ubase, recently graduated as police reservists.
“This specialized team will work directly with Police FSVU and CID at local stations, specifically to support criminal investigations and protect women and children from violence.
“Secretary Mr Jerry UBASE, who is also a Police Reserve Chief Sergeant, will lead the deployment, showing a strong commitment from the department's senior leadership.

Locals commended for apprehending suspects,5/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5937,,Local,Anger,Nill,"Lae Metropolitan Superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, has commended members of a community who apprehended some suspects as they were escaping from an alleged holdup.
Three men, believed to be part of a group called Operesen Brukim Tulait, or OBT, ran right into the hands of Butibam villagers on Wednesday night, where they were stripped and beaten up.
With Independence approaching, criminal activities have picked up around the city, and Lae Metropolitan Superintendent, Kunyanban drew attention to the unpopular criminal trend called Operesen Brukim Tulait.
Different communities in the city have their own versions of OBT gangs; some have more than 50 people that include women and children, while others have mostly young men. The identifying factors are; they walk around in very large groups and they mostly strike after midnight; when the community is asleep.
Late on Wednesday (September 3rd) night, locals at Butibam village – one of the areas affected by OBT robberies – caught five men who were allegedly on the run after holding up a company drop off vehicle along Awagasi and Asu Talair.
While two of them managed to escape, the other three were not so lucky, as they were stripped and beaten up by frustrated villagers.
At 12am on Thursday, September 4th, community leader, Gibson Jethro, posted a call to the police to pick up the suspects.
Kunyanban applauded the community, saying victims of crime have the right to defend themselves.
“I’d like to say, I’m very pleased, I’m very happy with what the Butibam villagers have done,” he stated. “It should go back to other communities as well. They have to be working together, they have to have their neighbourhood watch together, they have to address this issue.
“If you really look at the OBT, those are the kids back in the community. The community has knowledge of these people. The community has to address this issue together. They cannot put the blame on police all the time. Police cannot be there all the time.”
Kunyanban emphasised that police manpower and logistics are low, compared to the increased population and the uncontrolled movement of people into the cities.
Meantime, the three suspects, who are in police custody, had to be taken to the hospital for medical attention."

Fire fighters receive first aid training,5/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5930,,Health,Trust,Nill,"The Papua New Guinea Fire Service and the National St John Ambulance have joined efforts to strengthen the capacity of frontline responders through Emergency First Aid training, ensuring safer and more resilient communities.
Seventy-five (75) Fire Service personnel including sixty-one (61) recruits who are to be deployed across PNG in the coming months, received first aid training.
This joint initiative focused on equipping fire officers with vital life-saving skills to manage medical emergencies in the critical moments before advanced care arrives.
Firefighters are often the first to reach the scene of fires, accidents, and emergencies and now, alongside their existing firefighting expertise, they will be better prepared to assist people facing urgent medical needs.
The training program delivered by qualified first aid trainers included scene assessment and safety, Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), bleeding and wound care, burns, medical emergencies and patient assessment.
By expanding the capabilities of fire officers, the initiative enhances the overall emergency response network, improves community outcomes, and fosters confidence that help is close at hand when it is needed most.
""This collaboration reflects our shared goal of safeguarding the health and wellbeing of our people,” said Joannah Mea, Manager of Enterprise and Education at the National St John Ambulance.
“By combining the strengths of both organisations, we are building a stronger frontline that benefits every member of the community.” He added.
The leadership teams from both the PNG Fire Service and National St John Ambulance emphasized the significance of partnership in tackling the growing demand for coordinated emergency response. The program demonstrates the importance of inter-agency cooperation in protecting public safety and preparing communities to face crises with resilience.
This training initiative marks another step toward ensuring that PNG’s emergency services are equipped not only to fight fires, provide rescue, and save properties, but also to respond with care and confidence to health emergencies in any setting."
PMV driver detained for beating police officer,5/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5934,,Crime,Anger,Nill,"The PMV driver who allegedly beat up a police officer at the Lae Top Town bus stop yesterday morning is now in police custody.
Lae Metropolitan Superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, said one of their officers from the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) was making his way to the Top Town police station when a PMV driver, who was allegedly driving recklessly, almost hit him.
“That prompted him to ask the driver to stop and he told the driver to drive properly as there are a lot of people at the bus stop,” said Kunyanban.
The Lae commander said the PMV driver hopped out and started throwing punches at the CID officer, with other people joining in the scuffle as well.
“Eventually, some of them realised that he was a policeman but the damage was already caused.
“Our units responded to this and apprehended the driver. The driver has been charged and will appear before the court shortly.”
The incident led to a temporary closure of the town bus stop.
Kunyanban further pointed out that this is the kind of careless attitude that police have been talking to drivers about.
“If you are at the bus stop, drive slowly. Stop revving the engine and trying to weave in and out of traffic. This is causing a lot of headaches not only to the police but the public as well.
“Individuals who have driver’s licences need to comply with traffic regulations and adhere to the traffic signs that are placed on the different roads.
“Enough with the revving and rushing at bus stops. There should be some sort of order at bus stops.
“It’s the attitude that’s the problem.”"

The farmers received a pleasant surprise on Saturday, August 30, 2025 when local cocoa exporter, Linguan and Company visited the village and paid them cash.
The farmers collectively sold three tones of dried cocoa beans after a major rehabilitation program, initiated by memberss of a local non—governmental organization called Inland cocoa Technical (ICT), a group formed by the farmers in Madang.

In responding to concerns of securing markets overseas, Soma explained that this can only be achieved if there is consistency in production and quality. These he says remain a huge challenge for rural farmers.
He further stated that the Madang provincial government has allocated K1.1 million this year for the Provincial Cocoa roll-out program in Madang.

Villagers retaliate against gang,5/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5942,,Crime,Fear,Nill,"A 25-seater company bus, doing staff drop off on the night of Wednesday, September 3rd, was held up by armed men in Lae, Morobe Province.
It was between 10.30pm and 11pm when the vehicle, driving towards Butibam village from Awagasi, near Kamkumung, was surrounded by over 15 armed men when it slowed to go over a road hump.
“The men were standing on the roadside, in the dark,” shared one of the 12 passengers in the bus at that time. His name is being withheld for safety reasons.
“The bus windows were not tinted so they could clearly see each of us in the bus and they pointed their firearms right at each of us and ordered us out.
“They repeatedly kicked the door of the bus until it gave way. They dragged the driver out so all of us followed.”
Fortunately, no female staff were on board at that time.
All the men were made to lie face down on the muddy road while the group of men took their bags and started going through their pockets, one by one.
“At least six different men rummaged through my pockets while I was lying on the ground,” this newsroom was told. “They even checked the small watch pocket. I overheard one of them saying, ‘Check their fronts. Some of them hide stuff there’.
“They tried rolling me over many times but I refused to budge.
“They removed everything from our pockets, including wallets, cigarettes, lighters, loose change and even the NRL guide that I had in my back pocket.
“There was a family standing in front of a tucker box and when they saw what was happening, they tried to confront the men. That was when they fired at them.
“When I heard the gunshot, I lifted my head to look up. That was when I felt something hard hit me in the back of the head. They then pushed my head down into the mud with the butt of their firearm.
“After they were satisfied with their raid, they walked down while we got up, checked on each other then got on the bus and headed to the police station.
“Only three of us in the bus had hidden our phones when we knew were getting robbed.
“I retrieved my phone and notified my family.”
A number of staff on board were from Butibam village, and they had also called their families.
The village had been alert for a month now following an attack on an elderly woman and her family on the outskirts of Butibam.
Residents from Bumantop and Hengali came to the roadside and were standing there when they saw four unknown men walking towards them.
They accosted them and searched them, where they found a homemade gun and a number of wallets.
Additionally, one of them was wearing a boot that was taken off one of the passengers from Butibam.
While trying to bring them into the village, one of the men escaped. Men and youth from the village started beating up the other three suspects, one of whom was eventually identified as a resident there.
By midnight on Thursday, September 4th, Butibam’s deputy chairman and secretary for the Council of Chiefs, Gibing Jethro, issued a call to police to pick up the badly injured suspects.
When commending Butibam for taking action against crime, Lae Metropolitan Superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, confirmed that the suspects are part of the unpopular criminal trend called ‘Operesen Brukim Tulait’, or OBT.
Different communities have different versions of OBT Gangs. However, the gang’s strategy is to overwhelm their victims through sheer number – most numbering over 50 – and attacking after midnight.
“I’d like to say, I’m very pleased, I’m very happy with what the Butibam villagers have done,” Kunyanban stated.
“It should go back to other communities as well. They have to be working together, they have to have their neighbourhood watch together, they have to address this issue together.”"
Military tattoo set for the evening,5/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5932,,Events,Anticipation,Nill,"PNGDF personnel, including 10 other international militaries, will participate in the Military Tattoo event, which will take place at 4 pm today at the Sir Hubert Murray Stadium.
The military tattoo will showcase unique Pacific heritage and Commonwealth connections, through musical drill displays and performances. The Tattoo will also feature the famous 1812 Overture, as well as ceremonial artillery, parachutists, PNGDF battle displays, helicopters, and fireworks.
The military tattoo is a performance of music or a display of armed forces in general. The term comes from the early 17th-century Dutch phrase doe den tap toe ('turn off the tap'), a signal sounded by drummers or trumpeters to instruct innkeepers near military barracks to stop serving beer and for soldiers to return to their barracks. It is unrelated to the ink tattoo that was borrowed from Tahiti.
The tattoo event is open to the public, and it will also be broadcast live on the TVWAN channel and TVWAN Online."
TB services boosted in Pomio District,4/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5923,,Health,Trust,Elias Kapavore,"People of Pomio District in East New Britain Province can now access timely, reliable and life-saving TB services following the installation of a 10-color GeneXpert instrument and the commissioning of four new TB Basic Management Units (BMUs) in the district.
The National Department of Health (NDoH) last week, presented the GeneXpert Machine to East New Britain Provincial Health Authority (ENBPHA) CEO Dr. Ako Yap and Pomio District Administrator John Liskia to help address what may be a sleeping health crisis in Pomio district.
This makes Pomio the first district in PNG to have a 10-color GeneXpert machine with world-class TB diagnostic capacity that can rapidly diagnose Tb including drug resistant TB.
It can also cater for genotypic drug sensitivity testing for common first and second line TB drugs used in PNG.
These services are only available in provincial hospitals and with Pomio now having these services, it is now on par with provincial hospitals.
These developments follow a recent call by Health Minister and Member for Pomio, Elias Kapavore, declaring war on TB, representing not only a turning point for Pomio, but also a model for scaling up TB response in other remote districts across PNG. It also demonstrates the commitment of the National Department of Health, PHAs and partners to leave no one behind in the ‘War to End TB’.
The installation of the GeneXpert machine was done by the CPHL team from the National Department of Health and ENB Provincial Laboratory team. The GeneXpert installation and the assessment and commissioning of four BMUs in Pomio was supported by PATH as a partner in the War to End TB in collaboration with the ENB PHA.
While thanking the NDoH and acknowledging ongoing support from partners to improve health outcomes in the province, Dr. Yap urged health workers to work together to address health challenges in East New Britain.
“Our people must work together to maximize use of resources. We need to integrate our programs – government, churches – to serve our people,” said Dr. Yap from NDoH.
He acknowledged the work of the churches which run almost 80 per cent of the rural health services program in Pomio District.
“At the moment, we don’t have good TB services demonstrating the burden of TB in Pomio. We only have eight (8) BMUs in Gazelle and we need to work together to ensure we transfer skills to our health workers,” said Dr. Yap.
Procured with the support of World Bank-funded COVID-19 Emergency Response Project implemented by the NDoH, the 10-colour Gene-Xpert machine uses an automated system to perform rapid testing for various diseases including tuberculosis (TB), HIV Early Infant Diagnosis, Human Papiloma Virus (HPV), and COVID-19, providing diagnostic results within less than 2 hours, and detects TB with higher sensitivity unlike traditional lab tests.
This simplifies testing and makes it possible to get accurate results in settings without extensive lab infrastructure."

IMF urges Reform Discipline,4/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5926,,Business,Trust,Nill,"Papua New Guinea’s economy is gaining international confidence, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting a 4.5% growth rate for 2025, placing the country among the stronger performers in the Asia-Pacific region.
The update was delivered this morning by IMF Country Head Sohrab Rafiq at the Port Moresby Chamber of Commerce and Industry (POMCCI) breakfast briefing, attended by business leaders and policy advocates.
Rafiq praised PNG’s recent economic strides, citing low inflation, improved foreign exchange access, and sustained growth despite global headwinds.
He noted that inflation had dropped below 1% in late 2024, though recent data shows a sharp rebound to 5.28% in Q1 2025, driven by rising food, transport, and betelnut prices.
“The reform momentum is real, and the results are visible,” Rafiq said. “But discipline must continue, especially in fiscal transparency and monetary consistency.”
However, he emphasized that the shift reflects true market realities and could lead to eventual appreciation as foreign inflows rise, provided that the central bank maintains consistent policy to avoid destabilising price effects.
The IMF’s $918 million loan program, approved in 2023, has supported PNG’s reform agenda, including a flexible exchange rate system aimed at attracting private investment and reducing long-term borrowing costs.
Rafiq outlined key improvements since the launch of the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility in 2023, including:
•	A projected GDP growth rate of 4.6% for 2025
•	A sharp drop in inflation in late 2024 (rebounding to 5.28% in Q1 2025)
•	Reduced wait times for foreign exchange access, now averaging 2–4 weeks for SMEs
He credited the government’s reform discipline and the Bank of Papua New Guinea’s shift to a flexible exchange rate system, which has helped restore investor confidence and improve market transparency.
The IMF also flagged the upcoming Papua LNG project as a potential catalyst for growth, noting that improved international sentiment could lower borrowing costs for resource-linked infrastructure.
Still, Rafiq warned that LNG-linked spending could raise urban living costs by up to 40% without targeted mitigation.
The IMF’s next review will focus on debt sustainability, exchange rate management, and investment readiness, particularly as PNG prepares for expanded LNG operations and infrastructure projects.
Today’s briefing reinforced a cautious optimism: PNG is on a promising path, but the journey demands consistency, clarity, and community-centred planning."

Seven Vessels from Five Nations Parade in PNG’s Historic Fleet Review,4/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5921,,National,Trust,Bob Dadae,"Papua New Guineans lined the waterfront at APEC Haus in Port Moresby today (04 September) to watch naval crews stood to attention and ships passed in formation during a Fleet Review in the waters near APEC House, reviewed by the Governor-General Grand Chief Sir Bob Dadae.
The event brought together seven vessels from Papua New Guinea, India, France, Tonga and Australia. It served as a formal naval inspection, showcasing discipline, tradition and the cooperation that links Pacific maritime partners.
This was the first time PNG witnessed a fleet review, normally conducted to celebrate a significant naval event such as a jubilee or to remember an historic event (such as the Battle of Trafalgar).
As each vessel passed the review point, crew members saluted to the Governor General and in response two ceremonial guns were fired.
Seven vessels sailed past the review point to honour PNG’s proud naval traditions and recognize the important work done by PNG Defence forces both in national waters and the wider Pacific region.
Director of Maritime Operations for PNGDF, Commander Sebastian Marru, spoke of the fleet review and how it was a success even though one vessel couldn’t make it.
“The lead ship was the guide ship, meaning that every other ship in that sequence would take reference from the lead ship, and then maintain their positions as they go through. We actually planned for eight vessels. However, unfortunately, The Cape Gloucester couldn’t make it this morning. So, seven completed the fleet review today and it was successful.”
The fleet began with the Indian Ship (INS) Kadmatt, of the Indian Navy that was first to pass the review point, sailing behind with a 600-yard spacing was French Navy ship Auguste Benebig of the French armed forces of New Caledonian, followed by the Patrol Boat Ngahau Koula of the Tonga maritime force,  then PNG’s HMPNG Ted Diro, HMPNG Rochus Lokinap and HMPNG Gilbert Toropo of the PNGDF, before closing the fleet with His Majesty's Australian ship Childers of the Royal Australian navy.
When Marru was asked whether the country will witness another event as such, he said “hopefully”.
“Well, I wouldn't say yes, however, any major event may come up, hopefully we may see one again. If we don't see here, other countries, those partner nations, will host fleet reviews. Just like Tonga, when they had there 50 years last year, our own Gilbert Toropo was deployed to Tonga, doing exactly the same thing. So even if we don't have any in the near future, we still participate with our other naval counterparts.”
This spectacular maritime salute honours PNG’s proud naval traditions and recognizes the important work done by the country’s Defence forces both in national waters and the wider Pacific region."

Siune slams attack on Simbu public servants,4/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5915,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"Member for Kerowagi, Francis Siune, expressed disappointment over an attack on public servants and property at Druamugl, Simbu Province, over an assault incident last week.
The attack on police officers and the district administration officials stemmed from disagreements between local government representatives and the people over the change of venue for the 50th independence celebrations in Kup LLG.
In an earlier report, Simbu Provincial Police Commander Superintendent Mazuc Rubiang said the policemen were responding to the dispute when they were attacked.
Three police guns and a police vehicle were recovered, and three policemen were rescued on Sunday, August 31st, following an attack at Druamugle village in Kerowagi.
Sinue said the change of venue for the 50th Independence anniversary celebration happened for a reason, and it could have been addressed amicably when the District Administrator and Policemen were present at Druamugl. Instead, it demonstrated that our people and community leaders lack reasoning ability and analytical skills in decision-making.
He said it is only through respectful engagement that we can resolve differences and move forward together as a united community.
Siune state, “Unfortunately, the recent actions witnessed at Druamugl reflect a serious lapse in attitude and behavior, which continues to be a major obstacle to the progress and development of our district. I am deeply saddened and disturbed by the attack on three (3) police officers and the District Administrator for Kerowagi District. These public servants suffered both physical and psychological harm in the line of duty, and I extend my heartfelt sympathies to them and their families.”
“I am disappointed by the damage done to the vehicle belonging to the District Police Station Commander. Public servants, government assets, and institutions are in place to serve the people, and it is our shared responsibility to protect and respect them. Damaging these resources undermines the very services and protections that our people depend on.”
“Kerowagi District Development Authority will take full responsibility for repairing the damaged police vehicle. It’s not that we support such a negative approach from the community, but to demonstrate that KDDA is committed to upholding law and order in our district, which is truly the foundation upon which government services can be delivered and supports sustainable developments in the district.”
“The actions of those involved in this incident are completely unacceptable. I call for a full investigation into the matter. All findings must be properly compiled and submitted, and justice must be served where it is due.”
“I urge all citizens to exercise maturity, respect for law and order, and a spirit of unity as we commemorate this important milestone in our nation's history,” Sinue added."
Government taken to task over NID project,4/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5919,,Politics,Anger,Richard Masere,"The NID blame game continued in Tuesday’s parliament sitting. Minister for Administrative and Support services, Richard Masere announced plans to migrate to a biometric system of voting in the 2027 General elections using NID.
In response, Member for Hiri Koiari, Keith joined other members of parliament describing the NID project as a failed one and asked the government to admit this fact.
Iduhu shared that the NID biometric only covers 10 percent of the country’s population.
“It is safe to say that it is a failed project and so it baffles me as to how the Minister (Richard Masere) intends to migrate that little 10 percent to a biometric dream of voting in 2027. Does the Minister agree that his mandate given by the Prime Minister to discharge this very important work has failed and therefore he too has failed this country?” asked Iduhu.
Masere in providing his response blamed the previous government for creating the NID program for political convenience.
“They had created an agency that operated outside of the constitution, because of the political convenience and then as a result of that we had two agencies running parallel duplicating the same work. When I became Minister, I had to correct those issues that were created by former government,” said Richard Masere.
Masere’s biometric plans were met with more objection with Member for Ialibu-Pangia, Peter O’Neill joining the debate.
“Minister (Masere) is alluding that the funds were misused by the former government is incorrect… Do not point fingers, Minister admit your failures, so that you can correct your failures for once.”
But Minister Masere assured that the government has underfunded NID in the past 3 to 4 years and needed to gain more partnerships with members of parliament to drive the NID program in electorates."

Moveave peace committee want troublemakers arrested,3/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5912,,Conflict,Fear,Nill,"The Moveave Peace Committee in Gulf province is urging local police and government to address infighting between the Kamea and Moveave tribes. Recently, a peace talk was held between leaders of the two tribes to address ethnic differences. The committee shared that it has been months since the ethnic clash in late 2024, where homes and lives were lost. All parties want troublemakers brought to justice.
In 2024, a tribal conflict erupted between the Kamea and Moveave tribes after an incident that resulted in loss of lives and destruction to personal property including homes and gardens. The Kameas in the hinterlands of Gulf province access the coast through the Taure and Lakekamu rivers which is home to the Moveave people. The Moveave Peace Committee said they are concerned that since the conflict has not been addressed, tension remains, and conflict is likely.  Moveave Peace Committee Secretary Victor Isouve, is calling on the provincial government and police to arrest those responsible for the killings.
“The incident transpired from a criminal offence where a youth from Kamea was murdered within the 600 alluvial Gold mining site,” said Victor Isouve – Secretary Moveave Peace Committee. “The incident happened in September 2024 (and) in retaliation the Kameas mobilized and killed another youth from Moveave.”
People have been living in fear for months. Moveave Peace Committee Chairman, Herbert Pokana wants police to act quickly.
“It has taken us almost 10 months, we have got the government and police involved, but 10months down the road and there is little progress on this,” Pokana said. “It’s taken over 2 months now for the government to actually respond to the ceasefire agreement.”
A meeting was held on Thursday, August 28, between the Committee and Moveave villagers, and they have threatened to block the road along the Taure and Laekekamu bridges on the main Gulf Trans highway if authorities do not respond within 7 days. The ultimatum came into effect Tuesday September 2.
Gulf Provincial Police Commander Jefferey Lemb, is aware of the situation and has been at the forefront of negotiating for peace. He has also slammed the committee’s plan of action.
PPC Lemb said police are also having a tough time going after those who committed all the murders related to this issue, because of the harsh terrain and challenging geography. Lemb also warned that issuing threats to authorities does help the situation."

Tokura recollects years of service to Police force,3/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5910,,Police,Trust,Nill,"Chief of Bougainville Police Service, Deputy Commissioner Francis Tokura was among the first pioneers to train at Bomana Police College when the training program was first introduced in 1990.
Tokura joined the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) in 1979, four years after PNG gained independence. However, he was serving as a constable until 1990, when the cadet program was introduced, and he was among others who joined the program for the first time.
Initially, the officer cadet program was facilitated at Igam Barracks, but that responsibility was given back to RPNGC in 1990.
“We started our training in 1990 as officer cadets and graduated in 1993 after three years. I graduated as a young inspector, and I was posted to the police headquarters, where I joined the computer section, which is now the ICT directorate. After I served in the computer section for several years, I was promoted to Acting Director for Personnel and Training in 2002. The Personnel and Training Director, which is now the Human Resource Directorate.
“I served all my years at the police headquarters. However, I was only deployed to the Highlands region for election-related purposes.
“My first posting out of the headquarters was in 2008, where I was posted to the New Guinea Islands as the divisional police commander. At that time, Bougainville was given the autonomous government arrangement, so it wasn’t under my command.
“In 2010, I was recalled to Police headquarters as the divisional commander for NCD/Central.
“In 2015, I was appointed the Chief of the Bougainville Police Service, and have been serving till now,” he said.
Tokura said, like other law enforcement agencies, Bougainville police continue to face constraints with limited manpower, lack of proper training, limited accommodation, and limited vehicles. However, they strive to overcome these challenges with progressive steps to rebuild the force.
Reflecting back on his 46 years with the force, Tokura said as he signed his last contract this year, he looks forward to retirement with hope and determination that the Bougainville police force will rebuild its strength as the youngest police force if it gained independence.
Tokura says his contribution to the RPNGC will remain a legacy and a lasting reminder that working in a law and order profession comes with courage, determination, and passion to fight corruption, hold lawbreakers accountable, and ensure that vulnerable groups such as women and girls are protected."

Connect PNG reaches the unreached,1/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5875,,Infrastructure,Trust,Nill,"Connect PNG is not a scam, these were the words of a senior official from the Department of Works and Highways.
The Executive Director for Network Planning, Design and Standards, Simeon Suagu, said Connect PNG is changing the lives of those forgotten in the remote areas. He said these people see the road link as hope and a real impact.
After the momentous occasion this morning, when men who have been cutting the road link of the Morobe-Gulf Trans-National Highway for four years arrived in Port Moresby, they shared that Connect PNG is real and making an impact.
“Connect PNG is not a scam. You will see people really suffering, and this road is making an impact on the lives of those people who thought that they had been forgotten and that they would never be given any hope. These villagers are not seeing the real light, and this road is making an impact. You feel that pain, the challenges that they are going through, and then you will appreciate why this road is important to them.
“They have all the economic potential there, like coffee, but how can they bring it out?” said Saugu.
Steven Pup, the Executive Director Highways Management said that some people think four years is too long; however, they don’t understand the logistics and financial difficulties.
“People think the government gives us a lot of money, but that’s not the case. Our team felt hungry and discomfort many times.”
He acknowledged the Department head and the government for giving more support this year to accomplish opening the corridors.
“This road connects Menyamya, Aseki, Kaintiba, Kontidanga into Kerema and then opens to Port Moresby and then to Milne Bay. You can go to Lae, Madang up to the highlands and all the way to Telefomin as well,” said Pup."

PNGPCL delivers climate-resilient port in Kimbe,1/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5864,,Business,Anticipation,William Duma,"PNG Ports Corporation Ltd (PNG Ports) will deliver a ‘climate change resilient’ K340 million port to the people of West New Britain Province.
This will also provide more than 300 job opportunities, spin-off benefits for locals, and multiple future business opportunities.
At the groundbreaking ceremony held last Friday, PNG Ports chairman, Harvey Nii said this significant investment was for the people of West New Britain, who house Kimbe Port - PNG Ports’ third busiest port.
The project is funded by the Australian Government through the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific.
Nii explained that the 16-month project would see the existing port undergo “major marine and land rehabilitation works” to increase cargo volumes and vessel traffic by 2027.
He said upon completion, the upgraded port infrastructure will be climate-resilient, with the incorporation of climate change, disaster resilience, and social inclusion in the project design.
The Kimbe Port is critical to the growth of the New Guinea Islands.
Last year, 252 vessels were received at the port, with a throughput of over 450,000 revenue tonnage, much of which is attributed to the trade of crude oil palm oil, cocoa, vanilla, copra, fish, and logging.
Minister for State Enterprise, William Duma, said this crucial project marked a “transformative chapter” for the province.
“We must remind ourselves that we are not merely launching a construction project; we are laying the foundation for enhanced connectivity, stronger national unity, and sustainable prosperity for generations to come,” Minister Duma said.
“As our country marks 50 years of Independence, it is a moment for all of us to reflect on our achievements, acknowledge all the obstacles we had to overcome over the years and renew our commitment to building a new future for our children and our grandchildren.”
“The Kimbe rehabilitation perfectly reflects the vision of our founding fathers, one with opportunity and development for every district, coastline and province in our country,” he said.
Minister Duma elaborated that the Kimbe Port Rehabilitation Project also complements the Government's Connect PNG and Medium-Term Development strategy, where investing in infrastructure remains a top priority."

Sir Bob made the call at the Inaugural Royal Pacific Islands Regiment Black-Tie Dinner at APEC House in Port Moresby on Saturday evening.
“As we celebrate our 50th Independence Anniversary this year, and the 60th anniversary of the RPIR, it is time we seriously direct attention to the physical wellbeing of our servicemen and women.
“By that I mean developing and improving our military health facilities to cater for both physical and psychological rehabilitation of our defence force.
“This should be geared towards providing and sustaining professional and specialist services for mental and emotional support through therapy, professional counselling and guidance, as well as regular physical exercise and fitness programs, in all our military establishments throughout the country.
“This, I believe, will go a long way in addressing psychological trauma, mental stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other such mental issues that affect a lot of our servicemen.”
He said that through such rehabilitation programs, our servicemen will be able to reorient back into civil society and are better able to deal with, and avoid resorting to unhealthy and harmful habits such as drug and alcohol abuse, violence, and engaging in criminal activities.
The Governor General also called on the Royal Pacific Islands Regiment and the Defence Force to undertake documenting critical events that happened from 1975 to 2025, capturing the events that shaped the military history.

"Visit to remote Kotidanga, an eye-opener",31/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5860,,Government,Trust,"James Marape, Julius Chan, Mekere Morauta, Michael Somare, Sir Julius Chan","During a recent visit to Kotidanga in Gulf Province, and witnessing the reality and struggles faced by the people, the government has committed to continuing to deliver vital government services in rural areas of the country.
Prime Minister James Marape last week opened the road access into Kotidanga – a once-isolated hinterland area of Gulf Province.
Speaking to a large gathering at Kotidanga, a rugged frontier that now connects the Gulf
and Morobe provinces, during the opening of the Trans National Corridor Missing Link between Gulf and Morobe, PM Marape said the new road marked a historic step towards
linking long-isolated areas to the rest of the country.
“Although this is not yet a highway, one day it will be,” the Prime Minister said. “Step by
step, kilometre by kilometre, we are opening up roads so that our people are no longer cut
off. This road will one day unite the Papuan side with the Highlands, running as a true
national highway.”
PM Marape acknowledged that past leaders, including the founding prime ministers, Sir Michael Somare, Sir Julius Chan, Pais Wingti, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, Bill Skate, Sir Mekere Morauta, and
Peter O’Neill had aspired to connect remote parts of PNG, but the cost of the road construction had always been a major obstacle.
When addressing local demands for compensation, the Prime Minister urged communities to focus instead on opportunities that the new road would create.
The Prime Minister emphasised that these are not just ordinary roads, but “economic corridors” designed to unlock opportunities in agriculture, tourism, and resource development.
“Kotidanga and Menyamya (Morobe) are rich coffee-growing territories. With road access, more coffee can now be exported to international markets, creating income for farmers.
“Roads also give our people the opportunity to participate in eco-tourism and other productive activities that strengthen the rural economy,” he said.
“This road is for you – our teachers, our rural health workers, and our missionaries who serve
tirelessly in remote communities. As we mark 50 years of independence, my government
commits that no teacher, health worker, or policeman in remote places like Kotidanga will
be forgotten,” PM Marape declared.
Meantime, K1 million would be allocated to the Kerema District Development Authority to build school infrastructure."

ACP Guinness to retire after serving RPNGC for 50 years,30/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5849,,History,Joy,Michael Somare,"In 1975, during the Australian flag-lowering and Papua New Guinea flag-raising ceremony, ACP Northern Command, Peter Guinness, was a traffic officer at that time.
Joining the RPNGC on April 24, 1975, Guinness said he had the privilege to witness the ceremony firsthand as a first-time constable serving in the traffic unit.
“I was used as one of the traffic guys, standing at the junctions to direct traffic. We saw VIPs coming and going, and I had the opportunity to see the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare and Prince Charles, attending the ground-breaking ceremony at now the Parliament House. There was also a parade at Sir Hubert Murray Stadium, where the Australian flag was lowered and the PNG flag was raised.
“For me, it was a special moment for me, I really enjoyed this particular year 1975. After we gained independence, I was transferred to Mt Hagen, where I started my journey in the police force.
“I joined the police force as a Constable, and then I rose through the ranks, from Constable to Assistant Police Commissioner, I came through all the ranks, and I was able to get promoted every two years because of my commitment and dedication to duty. As an investigator, I contributed a lot to the organisation as far as law and order is concerned. As a result, I got promoted every two years, and I am happy with that.
“Because of my experiences, I usually tell my subordinates the way it was, the way it is, and the way forward.
“Based on my experience for the past 50 years serving the force, I noticed that previous governments have forgotten about the organisation, resulting in many things left deteriorated, particularly in housing and mobility.
“We have a good police force, but it has been mismanaged due to a lack of proper government support to enable the organization to run its affairs. We are not a money-making organisation, rather, we spend most of the money. However, when you see it from the law-and-order perspective, money doesn’t matter. Most of the law and order problems that are occurring in PNG can be managed if the police force is properly managed,” Guinness said.
ACP Guinness said this year will be the last year for him to serve the RPNGC, as he transitions into retirement. He carried with him a lasting impact and a heart of satisfaction as he had achieved most of his goals in safeguarding the people of Papua New Guinea in the justice sector."

Sir Julius Chan’s Legacy Immortalized on PNG’s Currency,30/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5841,,National,Trust,"Julius Chan, Sir Julius Chan","Papua New Guinea has paid tribute to one of its greatest founding fathers, the late Sir Julius Chan, as the nation celebrates 50 years of independence. His face has been officially featured on the new K100 note, launched during the milestone commemorative event in Port Moresby. This note will be released for circulation later in the year.
Delivering a heartfelt speech on behalf of the family, his youngest son, Julius Toea Chan, said the recognition was long overdue.
“PNG, we did it in fifty. We have come a long way in a very, very short time—from hunters and gatherers to who we are today: lawyers, doctors, teachers, bankers and so much more,” he told the audience.
Sir Julius was remembered as a humble yet visionary leader who prioritized the nation’s interests above all else. Known as the father of the kina and toea, he introduced PNG’s own currency on April 19, 1975—a step that firmly established the country’s financial independence.
“I cannot imagine the courage it must have taken to launch our nation’s own currency. To forge our own identity, as a nation independent from colonial masters,” said Julius Toea Chan.
The tribute coincided with the eve of what would have been Sir Julius’ 85th birthday. In a moment described by his son as “destiny,” the family honored both the currency’s 50th anniversary and Sir Julius’ lifelong service to the nation.
“My father never sought accolades or titles during his lifetime, he lived to serve… Tonight is the first time he has been officially recognized for his contributions to this country,” he added.
Sir Julius Chan’s enduring legacy now lives on—not only through his pioneering role in nation-building—but also in the currency that continues to define Papua New Guinea’s identity."

DoWH Secretary, Gibson Holemba, urged participants to make their training meaningful: “Ensure that these certificates (skills) can translate from the 4 days’ workshop to 4 years or so of your employment with impact.”
GGGI PNG Country Representative, Mohammad Ali Shaikh, stressed the importance of local capacity, “By equipping DoWH officers with the technical knowledge to integrate climate risk into road planning, we are not only strengthening institutions but also enabling solutions that will stand the test of time, disaster, and climate change.”
The program will continue with a South-South Knowledge Exchange in Auckland, New Zealand, from 23–30 August 2025, bringing PNG officials together with regional counterparts to learn best practices for resilient infrastructure development."
AI powered CCTV cameras for NCD,30/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5845,,Technology,Anticipation,Nill,"Over 80 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras will be installed in designated areas in Port Moresby in the next few months, as part of the NCDC’s CCTV rollout initiative.
The first phase of the initiative is the establishment of the control center, which has been completed at Alu the building in four-mile.
The second phase will be the installation of the cameras.
Parkop said the cameras are powered by Artificial Intelligence.
“AI will watch all the sites in the city, and it will detect if there is a problem and send the signal to the control room, where the police officers will pick up and address the issue with police officers on the ground.
“It will also capture facial identification, so perpetrators will also be identified.
“About 100 CCTVs were already installed through the PNG to China Society partnership, but it is not functioning due to no control room. Therefore, we will connect these cameras to the main control room as well,” he said.
Parkop said as the country approaches 50 years of independence, NCD is making an effort through this initiative to ensure the city is safe and secure for residents and visitors alike.
The initiative is a collaboration between the RPNGC and DataCo.
NCD/Central Commander Benjamin Turi in welcoming this initiative said, some of his officers have already been trained to facilitate the operation of the CCTVs.
However, Turi said more need to be done to train more police officers to drive this program, including technical expertise to assist police when the need arises.
While the initiative is ambitious, Parkop also highlighted the issue of unreliable power supply to power these cameras, noting that they ay look at solar or battery options for back up.
Meanwhile, Maigata Limited Project Manager, Himan Zhang said about 20 cameras will be streamed live starting next week.
The government has invested K15 million to support this initiative, adding to NCD’s K5 million funding."
K20 Million worth of commemorative K50 notes released,30/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5840,,National,Trust,Nill,"Papua New Guinea has released a commemorative K50 bank note and a colored 50 toea coin to mark its 50th Anniversary of Independence, with support from the Bank of PNG, Note Printing Australia, and the Royal Australian Mint.
Note Printing Australia CEO Malcolm McDowell highlighted the long-standing partnership with PNG.
“We’ve had a thirty-five year relationship with the Bank of PNG and of course we are delighted to be part of the journey and delighted to being part of the journey for so long.”
He added, “The last time a commemorative bank note was produced for PNG was seven years ago for the APEC Conference in 2018. This involved the overprint of the APEC Logo on the one hundred kina. Distinct from this last commemorative, this year’s commemorative fifty kina has involved the comprehensive note, redesigned to honor the fiftieth year of independence. Again I confirm that Note Printing Australia is delighted to be involved over the journey hopefully for many years to come and particularly in this event.”
Royal Australian Mint Acting CEO Emily Martin described the release as a meaningful symbol, “Previously we worked with the bank of PNG on a colored circulating coin in 2015, to celebrate the Pacific Games and in 2018 for the Asia Pacific Economic Corporation forum. Papua New Guinea is one of only a few countries that releases colored coins into circulation like Australia and we’re very proud to support that and we’re very happy to be here today to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Independence through the release of these coins.”
BPNG Assistant Governor Ron Sikar confirmed the note is a one-off issue, “This is a one-off print, this is a commemorative print and it won’t be printed again.”
A total of 20 million K50 notes and 2.5 million coins have been distributed to banks nationwide, ensuring circulation begins immediately.
The release follows previous commemorative issues, including the APEC K100 in 2018 and the Pacific Games coin in 2015, but this year’s designs carry the special significance of celebrating Papua New Guinea’s golden jubilee of independence."
"PNG, QUT agree ahead of State to Country MOU",29/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5834,,Technology,Trust,Nill,"Papua New Guinea has announced an agreement in principle between the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) and the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), to pay way for a State-to-Country Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that will cement deeper cooperation in digital transformation, applied research, and higher education.

Wewak youths trek with soldiers,29/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5830,,Community,Anticipation,Nill,"Over 25 youths from Wewak, East Sepik Province, are on foot patrol to Port Moresby on a special mission.
They traveled to Madang, then to Lae and Malalaua in Gulf Province. They are now in Central Province, expected to reach Port Moresby in the next few days ahead of PNG's 50th Independence Anniversary.
The Wewak Urban youth from 17 ward councils have joined the 1RPIR, who are on ""Exercise Antap long Ol 2025' walk and are trekking together. Reasons for this ambitious walk include promoting peace and stopping violence in PNG, and establishing a youth council office in Wewak.
Team leader Junior Sammy said they had split into two groups along the way, with 11 members of the group traveling up the Highlands region, and the rest followed the Bulldog Track to Malalaua, Gulf Province, before joining the 1RPIR on their way.
""Our cycling group does awareness on all forms of violence. We challenge youths to organize, register themselves, sit with their provincial coordinator, and seek if there's any way the government can assist youth programs,” Sammy said. “When we don't organize ourselves, that's when we don't get support from our government.”
Sammy added, ""Our focus now is that we will witness the PNG 50th anniversary, and after that, we will sit with the youth and community development office because we really need the establishment of the Youth Council in Wewak. We want an office for us, a body, where we youths can manage our own affairs.”
The team leader further highlighted that they believe youths can contribute significantly to the country's development; they need good support from local members, the national government, and the Department of Community Development, Youth, and Religion.
The Walkathon boys are in Central now, awaiting the 11 cycling members who are on their way. Once they arrive, they will together walk into Port Moresby ahead of PNG's 50th Independence Anniversary in September.
Meanwhile, a few members of the Wewak community, living in Port Moresby and led by Fidel Maury, paid a courtesy visit to the boys on Tuesday, showing their support.
Fidel noted that times have changed, and so has the attitude of the Youth. He said supporting the Wewak Youth during their walk will allow them to go back and change their district and province.
The Wewak Urban youth are grateful they are trekking for a great cause, and more so, along with PNG Soldiers of 1RPIR Taurama, who are reenacting the famous 1975 Exercise Antap Long Ol walk.
They urge youths throughout the country to stand up, establish a youth office in their respective provinces, and be the change in their community in the next 50 years."
Lae robbery leaves 6 dead,29/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5837,,Crime,Anger,Nill,"A robbery in Lae, Morobe Province, ended in tragedy with six gang members shot dead and three others wounded during a shootout with police. Two suspects remain on the run.
Lae Metropolitan Commander Chief Superintendent Chris Kunyanban said the gang hijacked a white 15-seater bus at 4-Mile before heading to Eriku to rob a Chinese-owned shop, identified as I1.
The group, believed to number between 11 and 12, stole cash, packets of cigarettes, and mobile phone top-up cards. While the exact amount of money taken is unclear, the shop owner said the till usually holds less than K1,000.
During the heist, the suspects fired at a police vehicle, narrowly missing an officer. Police responded swiftly, killing six of the armed men inside the bus and wounding three others, who were later captured.
Two suspects escaped, according to those arrested.
Chief Superintendent Kunyanban warned criminals that crime eventually catches up with them.
""You can commit different types of crimes and escape or hide, but one day you will pay for your crimes with your life. What happened today is exactly what I am talking about,"" he said.
He urged young men to abandon crime and seek honest ways to make a living."
Empowering Kokoda teachers to champion inclusive education,29/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5835,,Development,Trust,Nill,"Australia continues to support inclusive education across Papua New Guinea by investing in teacher training that mainstreams and promotes disability inclusion in classrooms.
This support has enabled sixteen schoolteachers from ten elementary schools in the Kokoda Track region to participate for the first time in an inclusive education workshop held in Sogeri.
Facilitated by Callan Connect in collaboration with the Gerehu Inclusive Education Resource Centre (IERC), the training sought to equip teachers with practical strategies to support students with special needs.
This initiative aligns with PNG’s national education policy and reflects Australia’s ongoing commitment to working side-by-side with Papua New Guinea to build a more equitable education system for all. The workshop was more than just professional development – it was also a transformative experience.
Teachers developed Inclusive School Learning Improvement Plans (iSLIPs), which are designed to help schools allocate resources and create supportive learning environments tailored to students with diverse needs. One participant, Richard Sangai from Boridi Primary School, walked for two days through rugged terrain to attend.
“Students with special needs deserve the best possible education,” he said. “This training gives me the tools to help them thrive alongside their peers.”
Previously, families in remote areas faced significant financial burdens to accessing special education services.
By bringing training directly to teachers, Australia is helping to reduce these barriers and ensure every child has the opportunity to learn in an inclusive, supportive environment.
Australia is funding the Callan Services National Unit (CSNU) to roll out Callan Connect in Western Province and the Kokoda Track region. Australia is also partnering with New Zealand to implement Callan Connect in Bougainville.
Callan Connect is a two-year project aimed at providing disability screening, diagnostic assessment services, treatment, and referral to specialist services for individuals with disabilities.

Kimbe port upgrade begins,29/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5827,,Business,Anticipation,"Francis Maneke, Sasindran Muthuvel, William Duma","Works on the Kimbe port in West New Britain Province will now commence, after the official groundbreaking ceremony held on Thursday, August 28 in Kimbe.
The Kimbe Port Redevelopment Project marks a PGK260 million infrastructure upgrade that promises to transform regional trade and connectivity.
The Kimbe Port project is the first of five major upgrades under the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP).
Future projects are planned for Oro Bay, Daru, Kavieng, and Lae ports.
The project reinforces Australia’s commitment to supporting PNG’s economic growth and regional connectivity, enhances infrastructure reliability, strengthens supply chain efficiency, improves connectivity, and boosts local economic opportunities.
Funded through a concessional loan from the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP) and delivered in partnership with PNG Ports Corporation Ltd, the redeveloped port is projected to handle over 600,000 tonnes of cargo annually by 2050, significantly boosting PNG’s palm oil export capacity.
Kimbe Port, first built in 1969, currently manages 75 per cent of PNG’s palm oil exports, valued at approximately PGK1 billion per year. The redevelopment will create up to 300 local jobs, with Pacific Marine Group Ltd handling marine works and Global Constructions Ltd leading PGK79 million in shore-based works.
Led by Minister for State Enterprises William Duma MP, alongside West New Britain leaders in Member for Nakanai Francis Maneke, provincial member Sasindran Muthuvel, and Australia’s High Commissioner H.E. Ewen McDonald, the event marked the start of construction on one of PNG’s most vital export hubs.
Minister Duma emphasized the long-term impact: “We’re not merely launching a construction project; we are laying the foundations for enhanced connectivity and prosperity for generations to come.”
High Commissioner McDonald added that the modern-day relationship is about supporting conditions for economic prosperity and that maritime infrastructure is important."
Turi issues tough measures to stop ethnic clash in the city,29/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5826,,Crime,Fear,Nill,"NCD/Central Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi has issued tough directions to his police personnel to maintain presence in areas in the city known for ethnic clashes, especially at night and into the early morning hours.
Turi’s direction comes following a recent incident at the back of the eight-mile/nine-mile road, where a group of people was seen marching during a commotion.
He said this group were from the Hela province, who were demanding compensation following the death of one of their own during a recent ethnic clash between Eastern Highlanders and Southern Highlanders.
Police investigation revealed that a drunken brawl had erupted into a full-on ethnic clash between the two factions on Saturday, August 04th, 2025.
Following this big fight, Eastern Highlanders involved, raided residences of Southern Highlanders at the eight-mile settlement the next morning. During that episode, a father and his young son died when the house they were renting, was set on fire. The landlord, who is from Hela and a long-serving employee of the city authority, also died during that attack, after he was struck in the head with a stone.
The person who started the fight, an Eastern Highlander, was killed in the initial drunken brawl the day before. After the whole tragedy, the number of deaths is four.
Turi said, “We have seen on social media people marching.”
“These are Hela people demanding that the Eastern Highlanders and Southern Highlanders pay for the old man's death.
“Police were quick to respond to the situation and stop them because all of them are in mourning, and anything can happen.
“I gave them directions that (during) any fights, do not leave until peace is established, because most of the deaths were a result of early morning raids.
“These people know that when they attack during the day, police will have evidence, so they raid in the night to morning hours, making our job difficult to gather evidence,” he added.
Turi is reminding the highlands community that the city is not a warzone, and that there are avenues to resolve issues. Retaliation and killing is not the answer."

A soldier’s son retraces dad’s historical walk,29/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5829,,History,Trust,Michael Somare,"Forty-nine years ago, seven-year-old Lionel Manuta stood beside his dad at the home of the 2nd Battalion Royal Pacific Island Regiment (2RPIR), Moem Barracks, watching 16 brave soldiers leave the barracks and ascend into the thick darkness of morning carrying with them a pre-independence message to Port Moresby.
Lionel waved at the soldiers and they waved back at him – silhouettes of waving hands in the dark. What he witnessed was the beginning of a 1200-kilometer walk led by Geoff Key - the walk called “Exercise Antap Long Ol”.
The 16 Second Battalion Pacific Island Regiment (2RPIR) soldiers brought with them letter(s) to the then chief minister, late Great Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, reaffirming that PNG soldiers were committed to a peaceful transition to independence.
Little did Lionel know that after 49 years he would embark on the same exercise, leading a team of his own. Major Lionel Manuta is now in charge of Combat Support Service Team (CSST) for the 2025 Exercise Antap Long Ol – a reenactment of the 1975 walk.
Major Manuta’s team takes care of logistics of the soldiers that are participating in this exercise. This historical exercise started in July with 2RPIR at Moem Barracks. They handed over the baton to Long Range Reconnaissance Unit (LRRU) and then the LRRU to 1RPIR who are now continuing the walk to Port Moresby.
Major Manuta recounts his 1975 experience: “My father was a soldier in Moem Barracks and I was a grade one student. I was so interested in the military, and my father asked me to see the soldiers walking up the range to Port Moresby. I asked him if he could take me up to see them (soldiers) starting the walk.”
“It was around 3 - 5 o'clock. I can't remember the time but it was early in the morning, that time I was around 7 years old and in grade one at Moem,” Major Manuta said. “I came with him (dad) at the battalion headquarter and I actually saw them walking out of the battalion headquarters, Moem Barracks. I waved at them, and they waved back. I actually witnessed that walk, that was way back in May, 1975.”
Major Manuta from, Deboin village, Tamata LLG, Sohe District, Northern Province, turned 58 while on this exercise. The CSST team, comprising four soldiers, celebrated his birthday in an eventful walk. He was grateful for the support he received from the team on his birthday, but even more grateful to have lived his dream as a soldier walking this historical walk.
Major Manuta and his logistics support team are with members of 1RPIR in Central Province. They are expected to arrive in Port Moresby on September 1, ahead of PNG Defense week leading into PNG’s 50th Independence Anniversary."
Major upgrade planned for airports,28/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5811,,Infrastructure,Anticipation,Wake Goi,"Plans are underway for a major overhaul of key airports in the country, with a special focus on the Jacksons International Airport in Port Moresby.
Minister for Civil Aviation, Wake Goi, announced these plans. He said the upgrades are aimed at modernizing facilities, increasing capacity, and supporting the country's growing economy.
The project is broken down into five main priorities: runways, parking bays, infrastructure, the creation of an ""Airport City,"" and a general redesign of existing facilities.
Mr Goi said a top priority is the expansion of the runway at Jackson Airport.
“The plan involves adding two new runways alongside the existing one to ensure flights can continue without disruption during emergencies.
“This initiative was highlighted by a recent incident involving a Boeing 737 that experienced a tire issue upon landing.”
The project is expected to be offered to bidders for an estimated 200 to 300 billion Kina.
“Runways at other key airports, such as Mount Hagen, will also be improved to accommodate larger planes.”
He further clarified that the aircraft parking bay is also set for a significant expansion, with a projected bidding cost of 1 to 1.5 billion Kina.
This project will extend the parking area towards the Helifix area, which will require leveling part of a mountain.
The airport's infrastructure is slated for a complete modernization.
Plans include:
•	A new two-story building connecting the international and domestic terminals. Extending the VIP lounge by 20-30 meters and the economy lounge by a similar length.
•	Reorganizing the terminals to have check-in counters downstairs and departure gates upstairs.
•	Increasing the number of departure gates to 8 or 10.
•	Additionally, rundown buildings will be redesigned and relocated to give the airport a more professional appearance, with facilities like the maintenance hangar potentially being moved.
Minister Goi said a key part of the long-term vision is the development of an ""Airport City,"" an investment expected to be between 3 to 4 billion Kina.
He said this project aims to create a hub of hotels and shops extending as far as the Gateway Hotel, making access easier for travelers.
The National Airport Corporation (NAC) would manage the project by collecting taxes and leasing out land.
“The plan would allow investors who hold land titles to receive a percentage return on their investment, which the NAC could repay as it generates sufficient funds. One company has already shown interest by offering to transfer 4 billion Kina for the project,” Minister Goi added."
Indian exporters brace for introduction of US tariffs,28/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5810,,Business,Fear,Nill,"Indian exporters are bracing for a sharp decline in US orders after trade talks collapsed and Washington confirmed steep new tariffs on goods from the South Asian nation, escalating tension between the strategic partners.
Goods entering the United States will face an additional 25 per cent tariff from Wednesday, local time (1:31am AEST), taking some levies to 50 per cent.
US President Donald Trump announced the additional tariff in retaliation for New Delhi buying Russian oil, which has become a key funder of its war in Ukraine.
The two countries are yet to sign a new trade deal with the Trump administration.
""The government has no hope for any immediate relief or delay in US tariffs,"" a commerce ministry official told Reuters, who sought anonymity for lack of authorisation to speak to media.
Exporters hit by tariffs would receive financial assistance and be encouraged to diversify to alternative markets such as China, Latin America and the Middle East, the official added.
Exceptions are shipments in transit, humanitarian aid, and items under reciprocal trade programmes.
The Indian rupee fell to a three-week closing low of 87.68 against the dollar, despite recovering some ground after suspected central bank intervention to support it.
Wednesday's tariff move follows five rounds of failed talks, during which Indian officials had signalled optimism that tariffs could be capped at 15 per cent.
Officials on both sides blamed political misjudgement and missed signals for the breakdown in talks between the world's biggest and fifth-largest economies, whose two-way trade is worth more than $190 billion ($292 billion).
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have accused India of indirectly funding Russia's war against Ukraine by boosting Russian oil purchases.
This month Mr Bessent said India was profiteering from its sharply increased imports, making up 42 per cent of total oil purchases, versus less than 1 per cent before the war, in a shift Washington has called unacceptable.
The stand-off has raised questions about the broader relationship between India and the US, important security partners who share concerns about China.
However, on Tuesday, the US State Department and India's Ministry of External Affairs issued identical statements saying senior officials of the ministries and defence departments met virtually on Monday and expressed ""eagerness to continue enhancing the breadth and depth of the bilateral relationship"".
The statements said both sides looked forward to increasing defence cooperation and also discussed trade and investment, energy security, critical minerals exploration, and counter-narcotics and counterterrorism cooperation.
Both sides also reaffirmed their commitment to the Quad, a partnership that brings together the US and India with Australia and Japan.
It is supposed to meet at leader level later this year.
India has issued no directive yet on oil purchases from Russia. Companies will continue to buy oil based on economics, three refining sources said.

Emergency Nursing Leadership,28/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5819,,Health,Trust,Nill,"In improving healthcare in Papua New Guinea, nurses have taken the lead in delivering the country’s first all-nursing Basic Emergency Care (BEC) training course.
Held in Port Moresby from August 18–22, the course was taught entirely by nurses, for nurses, a first for the region.
Led by facilitators from Port Moresby General Hospital, National St John Ambulance PNG, and ANGAU Memorial Provincial Hospital, the training marks a major milestone in empowering PNG’s nursing workforce with life-saving emergency care skills.
The BEC course, developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation for Emergency Medicine (IFEM), equips frontline providers with a structured approach to managing acutely ill and injured patients in resource-limited settings.
Eighteen nursing leaders from 14 provinces participated, including representatives from nursing schools and the National Department of Health (NDOH), ensuring national alignment and reach.
These newly trained leaders are now positioned to cascade their skills across the country, expanding the impact of BEC training beyond the classroom.
“This is a good thing,” said Sr Wilma Sebby, PNG’s first nursing BEC Master Trainer. “We’re speaking the same language, and we know that nurses are the frontliners for any healthcare system.”
Sr Marcia Willie, BEC Course Coordinator, added, “BEC training improves our everyday practice and helps us follow a systematic approach when dealing with life-threatening conditions.
Teaching fellow nurses gives us confidence to reach more colleagues and train them to become BEC providers.”
The initiative is part of a partnership between the Regional Emergency and Critical Care Systems Strengthening Initiative (RECSI), WHO Collaborating Centre for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Development at the University of Technology Sydney, and the NDOH.
Supported by the Australian Government through the Partnerships for a Healthy Region initiative, the course was facilitated by RECSI’s implementing partner, National St John Ambulance PNG.
With 135 healthcare workers already trained in BEC across PNG, this nurse-led expansion signals a new era of leadership and resilience in emergency care."

As a significant step forward, Madang Province awarded certificates of participation to 47 individuals who attended the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Child Protection System Strengthening Training at the Divine Word SVD Youth Centre Hall.
This achievement is notable because Madang is the first province to offer this training for social workers, facilitated by UNICEF.
The four-week training concluded last week, emphasising the need for improved policies and by-laws that could capture the protection of children in the country. Participants shared some of their challenges and accomplishments within their respective professions.
Theresa Kas, the Provincial Child Protection Consultant and also the Provincial Women’s Council President, was very outspoken about child issues in the province. Since there has been no proper coordination among stakeholders, challenges in gathering accurate statistics persist. However, she noted that only two provinces—Morobe and Enga—have fully established their Provincial Council for Children and Family Services, and she hopes Madang will also launch theirs in Bogia district before the year ends.
The participants were from various government and civil societies with the sole purpose of upskilling their knowledge and capacity in relation to child protection and child issues. Kas stressed that this is not the end and elaborated on the next phase of training, which will continue in the coming months.
Provincial Community Development advisor, Jubilee Dulau reminded participants that one way or another, their jobs were intertwined with children and their issues, and they must be prepared to address issues and be familiar with their partner sectors and the responses that would be undertaken.
To strengthen their system's network, they will still have to undergo and report a minimum of three cases that they have dealt with. These case studies are crucial in showing the stakeholders and facilitators that the training has been understood and would validate the training at a higher level. From there, they will later be awarded the actual training certificates.
Provincial administrator, Daniel Aloi reflected on this 50th Anniversary and spoke about how Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, during pre-independence, had a vision, and this included children who were not born yet. As he mentioned to our colonizers that the future of this country was with children who were babies and some were not even born yet.
Aloi stated that if moving forward, he would like to see a better plan and policy in place to protect women and especially children for the next 50 years.
He also emphasized that if policies were to be made, he would rather see that they truly have weight and meaning to be included and passed as law in parliament and not become one of the many “charity agenda” for women and children.
Government and civil participants included enforcement agencies, police, CIS, DJAG, Magisterial services, CWA, Madang Council of Women representatives from districts and provincial office, health sector, Persons with Disability, DWU staff, Catholic Archdiocese, Red Cross Madang, Faith-Based and non-government organizations, and the team from Community Development who, through their office made the training possible."

“Meeting others working in this space reminded me that I am not alone.”
The GBV Secretariat also shared progress on developing minimum standards for safe houses to improve service quality and consistency.

New police offices in Kokopo,28/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5806,,International,Trust,Nill,"The PNG-Australia Policing Partnership opened an extended regional and provincial police headquarters at Ralum, in Kokopo, East New Britain Province, yesterday (August 27).
The extension works cost the Australian Federal Police K3.2 million, and includes the upgrading of the ground floor of the building and the construction of new office spaces upstairs.
PNG-APP assistant commissioner, Jamie Strauss, said the three new office spaces cater for the provincial Royal PNG Constabulary (RPNGC) administration office, aimed at enhancing service delivery, as well as an APP office for both Australian and locally engaged staff, and an ICT office to advance digital connectivity and capability of the RPNGC.
“The next project will be the delivery of a forensic science facility in Kokopo, which I know is a very important capacity need of the RPNGC,” Strauss said.
Under the PNG-APP program, a 40-man and 20-woman quarter will be constructed respectively at the Baliora police barracks. This is to be completed by October 2025.
Strauss outlined that this partnership was established after the signing of a bilateral security agreement between the two governments of PNG and Australia.
“Since then, the AFP has been able to expand its footprint across PNG, so we now have members based in Kokopo and Mt Hagen as well, apart from Lae and Port Moresby.
“Ceremonies like today, are part of the benefits of having our people in those locations. Because we are on the ground and can expand and support you in the job that you need to do for PNG citizens.”
ENB Provincial Police Commander, Chief Inspector Felix Nebanat, acknowledged the presentation of a 24-foot fully-kitted banana boat that will assist the police in the province to service the coastal areas.
“This boat will be given to the Kokopo police station, to police the islands, as well as the Pomio district, if we need to. We still need sea policing in other parts of the province, along the north coast going up to the West New Britain provincial border,” he said.
The boat is also funded under the PNG-APP program at a cost of K140,000.
In acknowledging the support from the PNG-APP, ENB Provincial Member (Governor), Michael Marum, said this is an important milestone for policing in the province.
“In the past 3 weeks, we have witnessed a series of important developments, in terms of the delivery of the new Tomaringa police fleet, opening of the new Tomaringa police administration building, handover of the Tokua police post, and now the opening of the new wing at the police regional and provincial headquarters. This is apart from the current police reservists training program and the construction of the new Taliligap police post,” Marum said.
He further assured the provincial government’s support to the RPNGC and the law and justice sector, to ensure the province is safe again."

The announcement was made by the Papua New Guinea Oscar Selection Committee, operating under the PNG Academy Awards Secretariat within the National Cultural Commission. The committee described the achievement as a proud reflection of PNG’s cultural identity and artistic voice on the global stage.

“This is a historic moment for Papua New Guinea cinema. Papa Buka embodies our stories, our traditions, and our artistic voice, and we are proud to present it to the world through the Academy Awards platform,” Dr. Niles said.
The film’s selection underscores growing recognition of PNG’s creative industries and cultural contributions internationally. For Wunum, who is part of the production team based in PNG, the selection highlights the opportunities for local filmmakers to showcase their work globally.
The PNG Oscar Selection Committee, officially recognized under the National Culture Commission, reviews eligible films annually and selects one to represent the nation in the International Feature Film category. This year, Papa Buka stood out as the production that best represented the identity and creativity of the nation.
The nomination is seen not only as a cinematic breakthrough but also as a symbol of pride for the people of PNG. It offers the chance for the world to experience Papua New Guinea’s stories and traditions through film—something many believe is long overdue.
If successful in progressing further at the Academy Awards, Papa Buka could open doors for more PNG filmmakers and inspire future generations in the country’s growing film industry."

Middle Fly District Administrator Petrus Malongim commended PNGSDP during its 2024 Program Update last week in Kiunga, saying the approach demonstrates transparency, accountability, and a genuine commitment to partnership.
He said presenting updates at the provincial level provides stakeholders a clear picture of SDP’s work across the Western Province and opens the door for collaboration in its plans across the four districts.
“It gives a clear idea of where your footprints are and your plans going into the future in terms of covering all districts in the province,” he said.
He also expressed his plans to partner with SDP to establish basic infrastructure that would enable the delivery of health and education in Middle Fly District.
The Kiunga Program Update held on August 20 follows an earlier session held in Daru on August 6. These updates provide key stakeholders with visibility of SDP’s 2024 activities, reinforcing the organisation’s commitment to being accountable to the people of Western Province.
District leaders called for stronger and closer partnerships to create greater impact with development partners.
A key takeaway from the Daru 2024 program update was the request for SDP to establish a stakeholder working group, a forum to align efforts and drive lasting change together.
SDP Chief Executive Officer Lesieli Taviri said the program update is part of SDP’s commitment to share important achievements of the program with leaders and the people of Western Province, on the work done in the communities throughout 2024.

Funding limits ESP students’ access,27/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5791,,Education,Sadness,Nill,"Secondary school students need access to information if they are to make informed career choices.
However, funding limitation has prevented more upper secondary schools in East Sepik from participating in the province’s second career expo that was recently held in Wewak.
East Sepik Province hosted its second career expo at the Mercy Secondary Technical School in Wewak, where more than 300 Grade 12 students attended the three-day event.
Out of the 20 secondary and technical schools in ESP, 13 participated, travelling from schools such as Passam School of Excellence and the secondary schools of Maprik, Dreikikir and Angoram.
East Sepik’s guidance officer, Melissa Basho, said their first expo in 2024 had 14 schools involved.
“The rest – because of distance and funding – they didn’t make it,” said Basho.
“Likewise, this year as well, the principals said that they have a shortage in TFF funding this year so for the schools that are outside, because I’m organising this event, I cannot look after the students.
“If they bring students out, they need to have lunch provided, transport for them to come; everything needs money.
“That’s why for this year, I believe I will have not more than 13; last year was a good turnout because principals had money and they were able to bring their students.”
Tertiary institutions that travelled into the province for the expo included the University of Goroka, the Papua New Guinea University of Technology from Lae, who set up along with the University of PNG, Divine Word University’s Kaindi campus, Mapex, and other technical schools.
“Information is power. If big institutions outside the province could come and give them firsthand information, that would be very helpful,” highlighted Ms Basho.
Deputy principal academic of Maprik Secondary School, Molland Saluali, said they received valuable information on the different courses and requirements from the tertiary institutions.
“This career expo has enlightened some of my students, especially with areas that they have doubts over, like courses offered not only at Unitech but the other institutions as well,” Saluali stated.
“It helped us to identify the course and the criteria, what is required to get into the institutions. It also helped us to understand the processes that the students will go through to get into the institutions.
“Over the years, we have experienced a lot of hiccups, especially with the students’ choices. But after going through this, I think we are in a better position to make good decisions on their choices.”
Saluali said the information they have received will be shared with the students and teachers who were not able to attend, with him adding that the expo needs to be hosted annually."
Blue licenses for Madang police officers,27/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5799,,Local,Trust,Nill,"It was an accomplishment for the Madang police command as 37 participants underwent two weeks of training to gain their blue licenses on Friday the 22nd.
This is the second Royal PNG Constabulary National Centre of Excellence nationwide Permit Program on basic driving after Milne Bay province, for police officers to attain blue licenses in order to drive police marked vehicle.
Over the years, the course on basic driving and issuing of permits was an inclusive bundle for new police recruits at the Bomana National Centre of Excellence (NCoE), however, over the years when situations plummeted it was plucked out by former instructors leaving thousands of police men and women driving without blue licenses nationwide.
Senior Daniel Apuau the Manager of the driving school of NCoE, said it was upon request by Madang PPC that the team from Port Moresby flew in to conduct the permit program.
He hopes the hierarchy can realize the importance of this program and support financially so that it can be rolled out thoroughly in all 22 provinces for police men and women.
Director for Training and person in charge of Advanced Skills Superintendent Charlie Sare, congratulated the 37 participants are from within the province. He thanked them for their effort and challenged them to take ownership of the vehicles ensuring that they do not endanger or risk lives of others, passengers, family members and ruin the vehicle because of reckless driving.
Sare urged them to be mindful and added that more programs are likely to be rolled out in future when funding is confirmed.
Superintendent Steven Bunga the Director Corporate Services emphasized on the importance of having these courses available for officers. He also said the permits will also serve as a safeguard for officers, especially in the event when there is an accident involving a police vehicle.
Superintendent Bunga reiterated on self-discipline whilst holding onto police vehicles and urged them to be better role models for the communities at large. He stated that it was a tool given to utilize in handling their roles and responsibilities as police officers while using police vehicle.
The Provincial Police Commander Acting Superintendent Robert Baim thanked the team from Port Moresby who took time off to kick start training in Madang. He acknowledged that it was timely as the province is set to receive new fleets and officers will now be required to utilize their blue licenses.
Meantime, he warned officers not to abuse using police vehicle just because they have a blue license, however, the call to drive will be upon their superiors’ orders.
He also advised them to lead by example and honor their duties and take care of government assets entrusted to them."
"East Sepik Education improving, says Bird",27/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5797,,Education,Joy,Allan Bird,"We are not number one, we are not doing brilliantly, but in terms of the current measurement system, we've improved a lot in East Sepik Province. These were the words of East Sepik Provincial Member, Allan Bird.
After a decade, the province has experienced a significant change in school rankings. Bird believes East Sepik has improved its education standards. He said several schools in the province have risen from no ranking to become among the top 10 schools in the country, attributing this change to the reforms recently implemented.
“In 2017, we had a lot of parents complaining that a lot of kids in 2016 and 2017 were not making it to tertiary institutions.
“Last year, ESP had three schools in the top 10 in Papua New Guinea. That's from zero in 2017, now we have three. So, in the top 20, we've probably got about eight schools in the top 20. In West Sepik, you've got two schools. So out of the top 10 schools in the country, five of them are in the Sepik region.”
Bird stated that, while there is a long way to go in improving the quality of education for children in the province, the number of students from ESP selected for tertiary education has increased dramatically.
He said he knows many children are selected for tertiary education, because the number of students qualifying for the Tertiary Fee Subsidy this year is the highest since they started the program seven years ago. A 60 per cent increase from 2018.
“So, we've come a long way in education. The people working in education understand the vision. And we're still doing a lot in education.”
Bird added that health services have also improved during his term in office. From the province being ranked 21 out of 22 provinces in the country, health services have improved and are now ranked 11 out of 22 provinces.
“We're not number one, we're not doing brilliantly, but in terms of the current measurement system, we've improved a lot, and we still have a long way to go.”"
SP Brewery Signs GBV Training Partnership,27/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5789,,Social,Trust,Nill,"SP Brewery has taken another major step in the fight against gender-based violence (GBV) by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on August 25th with the National GBV Secretariat, the Department for Community Development & Religion, and the Somare Institute of Leadership & Governance (SILAG).
Managing Director Ed Weggemans described the partnership as a bold move. “It gives me great pleasure to speak at this very important moment; the signing of a MoU Partnership between SP Brewery, the National Gender Based Violence Secretariat, the Department for Community Development & Religion, and the Somare Institute of Leadership & Governance (SILAG).”
Since October 2024, SP Brewery has been part of NGBVS-sanctioned events under its Anti-Violence Campaign, gaining insights into the scale of GBV across the country. Mr. Weggemans said these engagements shaped the company’s decision to use its SP Lager brand to speak out against violence.
He stressed the initiative is timely as Papua New Guinea approaches its 50th Independence. “We believe investment in a GBV training program to train human resources will add value to the important work of the Secretariat and Government policy and contribute immensely towards delivering effective community prevention programs.”
SP Brewery has partnered with SILAG since 2017 to train over 200 public servants in leadership and governance. Building on this model, the new MoU aims to deliver specialized GBV training aligned with national policy.
Mr. Weggemans concluded, “Moving forward, we envision a robust partnership… not only to deliver a comprehensive GBV training program that inspires behavioural change, but also to inspire other corporates and organizations to forge such partnerships and take an explicit stand against violence.”"
Simberi LOs to finally sign CDA,27/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5798,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"The landowners of Simberi Gold Mine in New Ireland Province through the Simberi Mining Area Landowner Association (SMAA) are set to sign the long-delayed Community Development Agreement (CDA) this Friday, August 29, in Port Moresby.
Originally approved by the National Executive Council (NEC) in 2013 under Peter O’Neill's Government, the CDA was delayed due to unforeseen circumstances.
Now, more than a decade later, SMAA executives and 31 of its members have formally requested the Mineral Resources Authority (MRA) to proceed with the signing, eager to unlock long-promised benefits and services.
In response, MRA Managing Director Jerry Garry affirmed the authority’s commitment to facilitating the signing, in line with its mandate. He emphasized government’s determination to ensure landowners receive greater returns from their natural resources.
Mr. Garry also highlighted MRA’s ongoing efforts to improve the livelihoods of resource landowners, citing the Woodlark housing relocation project as a prime example.
In that case, MRA intervened to ensure the developer constructed permanent homes equipped with essential amenities such as water tanks and septic toilets—demonstrating the MRA’s dedication to securing tangible outcomes for all landowners.
He also briefed SMAA members on the future of the Simberi project and broader government plans aimed at enhancing landowner participation and benefit-sharing.
Over the past four weeks, SMAA executives and 30 members have been in Port Moresby undergoing intensive training, now successfully completed.
The program was delivered by three institutions: the Somare Institute of Leadership & Governance (SILAG), the PNG Institute of Banking & Business Management (IBBM), and the Center for Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI). SILAG focused on development plan alignment and formulation, IBBM offered courses on influential leadership and governance, while CEFI provided financial literacy training.

What is National Repentance Day?,26/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5785,,Culture,Trust,"James Donald, James Marape","This year marks 14 years since the first Repentance Day was observed following the gazettal of this day as a public holiday and the announcement by then Prime Minister Peter O’Neill in 2011.
According to news records available online, the decision to declare August 26th as the National Repentance Day came about following requests by leaders of various churches to formally recognize the informal National Day of Prayer as a public holiday where the whole nation participates in prayer and seek God’s forgiveness and favour upon Papua New Guinea.
This is what Pastor Jack Edwards of Shema Evangelism Ministry told the ABC news back in 2011 during the inaugural National Repentance Day.
“Basically a time when we ask the people of our nation to come together and pray and ask the Lord to forgive us for the wrongs that are happening in our nation,"" he said.
""So everybody can find time to go to a church and pray, or if they [are not] able to, then stay back in their house and also pray for the country.""
Now part of the calendar of events for PNG, August 26th brings together people of all walks of life to fulfill this – pray and seek God’s forgiveness.
It is on this day that Prime Minister James Marape, upon taking office in 2019 just three months earlier, took to the podium to pray and repent on behalf of the nation.
“I pray for curse to anyone occupying public office – from the highest in Prime Minister’s office (crowds cheering), down to every public service occupation. And I am speaking on your behalf because pastors will speak on behalf of their congregation. I am speaking as the head of the national executive - I pray for curse.”
Part of the prime minister’s speech on National Repentance Day in 2019.
His words have been the subject of criticism over the years, with some critics and commentators linking this to the state of the country – the low social indicators, the corruption, the inflation, the law-and-order problems an so forth, blaming this downward performance to the curse.
The prime minister was also questioned in parliament by the Member for North Fly, James Donald – who also played the recording in parliament - early this month and asked to withdraw his words.
However, the prime minister defended his comments saying, “I pronounced curse on the practice of corruption, which is totally different from curse to the country.”
“The country was never cursed and will never be cursed.”
“If you look at the full text, I said corruption, which also means to me and my family.
“What do you expect the leader of a country to do? To allow and not condemn corruption?” he asked in response.
Despite these criticisms, the National Repentance Day is a national gazetted public holiday and will continue to be observed year in, year out.
This year’s National Repentance Day is quite important as it falls just three weeks before the country celebrates its 50th year of Independence.
And with the Gospel Band, Sinach in the country and the atmosphere reverend following a weekend of Jubilee Reset Concert, many turned up at the Sir John Guise Stadium early this morning to observe this day.
Prime Minister James Marape reminded citizens of the guiding principles of the constitution that are based on Christian Ways.
“Our forefathers placed this nation under the guidance of God when they raised the flag on Independence Hill in 1975,” he said.
“As a Christian people, we are accountable to God in the way we live, in the way we govern, and in the way we treat each other.
Repentance Day is therefore not just a public holiday, but a sacred day for us to humble ourselves, to say sorry for our wrongs, and to commit ourselves to a new way of living.”
“This day compels us to pause and reflect — to acknowledge where we have fallen short in our personal lives, in our communities, and as a country,” he said. “We must say sorry to God and to one another, and make a conscious pledge not to deliberately repeat the same mistakes. That is the true meaning of repentance — not just words, but a change of heart, a change of attitude, and a change of conduct.”"
23 police executives sign employment contracts,26/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5782,,Government,Trust,Nill,"23 police executives have signed their employment contract, signifying their commitment and leadership to the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary.
Initially, 25 were supposed to sign their contracts; however, two did not make it.
They range from the ranks of Deputy Commissioners of Police, Assistant Commissioners for Police, Metropolitan, Directors, and Provincial Police Commanders.
Police Commissioner David Manning initiated the three-year contract signing ceremony today Port Moresby.
In his opening remarks, Manning said these officers have signed the contract based on their performance, commitment, and dedication to the RPNGC.
Manning said the lack of good leadership is a major concern in the police force, something these leaders must take into consideration and improve in their respective commands.
“Lack of engaged leadership is what we are subject to, turning in late at work and leaving early are some of the behaviors police executives are practicing in the force. This shows that you no longer feel the edge of responsibility for your command.”
He urged the officers to perform to the best of their ability, as their performance will be monitored starting today.
“Our men and women expect competent leadership; provide that leadership when you go out there to serve our people, “ Manning added.
Northern Command Commander ACP Peter Guinness, who spoke on behalf of the executives, thanked Manning for recognizing their efforts in providing policing services to the people of PNG.
Guinness said that as they take on this role as leaders of the RPNGC, they carry on the responsibility to be agents of change in the police force."

The Prime Minister said this will be the first time a UN Secretary-General will spend four consecutive days in Papua New Guinea.
“Fifty years on, this is the first time ever that a United Nations Secretary-General has come to our country. And it is not just a fly-in, fly-out visit, but a four-day stay – something quite unprecedented for the Secretary-General in any single location globally,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“This visit is a profound honour for our people. The Secretary-General’s presence demonstrates recognition of Papua New Guinea’s consistent respect for democracy, individual freedoms, human rights, and peacebuilding since Independence.”
He highlighted that the visit will also acknowledge the Bougainville Peace Agreement of 30 August 2001, a landmark in peace and reconciliation, and Papua New Guinea’s role in maintaining peace and unity within its diverse communities.
During his stay, Secretary-General Guterres will:
• Call on the Governor-General, the Head of State, and meet with Prime Minister Marape.
• Address the National Parliament on Wednesday, 3 September.
• Travel to Mt Hagen in the Highlands on Thursday to witness community peace initiatives and visit forest areas that showcase Papua New Guinea’s rich biodiversity.
• Return to Port Moresby on Friday before departing that afternoon.
Prime Minister Marape said the Secretary-General is expected to speak on Papua New Guinea’s global significance as one of the world’s great biodiversity hubs, and to recognise the nation’s leadership in environmental stewardship and sustainable development.
“This September will be a momentous month. As we celebrate 50 years of Independence, we are humbled that global leaders, including the UN Secretary-General and His Royal Highness Prince Edward, will join us.
Their presence affirms that Papua New Guinea is not isolated, but a respected member of the international community,” Prime Minister Marape said.
He urged Papua New Guineans to unite in dignity and respect as the country welcomes international guests during this historic golden jubilee."
PM stresses message of forgiveness on Repentance Day,26/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5781,,National,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has urged all Papua New Guineans to see today (National Repentance Day) as a time of reflection, forgiveness, renewal, and a reset of true Christian character before God and each other, especially as the country prepares to mark its 50th Independence Anniversary next month.
With the nation’s golden jubilee only three weeks away, Prime Minister Marape said this year’s Repentance Day carries even greater significance.
“In just three weeks, Papua New Guinea will turn 50. We must ask ourselves: What have we done with the gift of independence entrusted to us by our forefathers? Have we honoured God? Have we honoured one another?”
He added: “As we prepare to celebrate 50 years of independence on 16 September 2025, let us use this Repentance Day to say sorry for the wrongs of the last 49 years, to forgive each other, and to make a firm resolution to enter the next 50 years with clean hearts and renewed minds.”
He further reflected: “The Scripture in Leviticus 25:8–10 speaks of a national reset after 49 years, a time of restoration and renewal. As we now step into our 50th year, let us follow this divine instruction — to reflect deeply, renew our characters, and commit ourselves to a fresh beginning for Papua New Guinea.”
Prime Minister Marape reminded citizens that since 1975, Papua New Guinea has always declared its identity as a Christian nation.
“Our forefathers placed this nation under the guidance of God when they raised the flag on Independence Hill in 1975,” he said.
“As a Christian people, we are accountable to God in the way we live, in the way we govern, and in the way we treat each other.
Repentance Day is therefore not just a public holiday, but a sacred day for us to humble ourselves, to say sorry for our wrongs, and to commit ourselves to a new way of living.”
“We must say sorry to God and to one another, and make a conscious pledge not to deliberately repeat the same mistakes.
That is the true meaning of repentance — not just words, but a change of heart, a change of attitude, and a change of conduct.”
He also highlighted that the 10 Commandments, given by God as the moral foundation for humanity, provide a clear guide for the nation’s renewal.
“The first four commandments remind us to love and honour God above all else. The remaining six guide us to live rightly with our fellow human beings. If we hold to these simple truths, we will eliminate corruption, violence, and lawlessness from our homes, communities, and country,” he said.
“The easiest yet most powerful contribution each of us can make to Papua New Guinea is to live with respect — respect for God, respect for our fellow man, and respect for our nation’s laws.”
The Prime Minister concluded with a strong call for unity, forgiveness, and the renewal of national character: “If every citizen of this nation honours God and respects their neighbour, there will be no corruption, no gender-based violence, no tribal fighting, no abuse of law, and no destruction of property. Instead, there will be peace, unity, prosperity, and the blessing of God over our country.
“I urge all Papua New Guineans — leaders and citizens alike — to take this Repentance Day seriously. Let us reflect, forgive, and recommit ourselves to God, to each other, and to our nation."
Over 900 inmates commemorate National Repentance Day,26/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5775,,Society,Hope,Nill,"More than 900 inmates at Bomana Correctional facility in Port Moresby joined the rest of the country in commemorating the National Repentance Day today.
The commemoration service, held annually within the prison, is an important event that allows inmates to reflect on their lives while serving time in the correctional institution, and to consider making a fresh start after their release.
The main celebrant of the day, Senior Pastor Rodney Tomuriesa of the Foursquare Living Light Church, blessed the inmates with a message of hope, sharing a scripture from 2 Chronicles 7:14. As a moment to reflect for a turning point in life, the verse highlighted the power of repentance, humility, and prayer in bringing about spiritual renewal and national healing.
The scripture instilled hope in the hearts of many inmates, encouraging them to accept Jesus Christ as their Saviour and source of renewal in their lives.
Acting CS Commissioner Bernard Nepo, who officiated at the event, took the opportunity to seek forgiveness as a significant act of repentance on behalf of Correctional Service staff who may have caused offence to anyone within the prison or the wider community."
Madang province dedicated,26/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5779,,Local,Trust,Ramsey Pariwa,"In what was a solemn occasion, the Governor of Madang Province, Ramsey Pariwa declared and committed Madang Province to God. The governor was also anointed to serve the province.
These all happened following the ‘Jesus March” this morning from bates Oval to Laiwaden Oval to mark the Repentance Day.
Themed “God is doing a new thing” the activities of this morning were a culmination of a two-day crusade hosted by the Body of Christ in Madang at the Laiwaden Oval since Sunday, 24th August 2025 as a lead up the National Repentance Day.
Many christians turned up in numbers as early as 6am at the Bates Oval to begin their walk up to Laiwaden with songs of worship and praise. This march signified solidarity and unity of the province despite the challenges faced. It was also a show resilience of the spiritual realm with the power of the people through faith in achieving peace and prosperity for the province.
The March saw the public joined by senior public servants from the province, including Governor Ramsey Pariwa and students from the Maritime College participating.
A service was held at Laiwaden after the walk, followed by the dedication of the six districts by six pastors through prayers.

The official National Repentance Day activities ended at around 10am.
Police were also acknowledged for their presence in maintaining order throughout the entire program."
Dregerhafen issues continue,26/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5771,,Education,Sadness,Nill,"The former school of some of our founding fathers in Finschhafen, the Dregerhafen Technical Secondary School, has become a pitfall in secondary education; a stark contrast to the pre-independence era.
Ward 10 councillor in Heldsbach, Okacne Narekine, highlighted that for the past five years, most of their students have given up and returned home due to the constant fighting. This directly leads to an increase in unemployment and social disorder.
Narekine pointed out that while Finschhafen holds historical significance in terms of it being the landing place of the first Lutheran missionary in Papua New Guinea in 1886, and being a thriving economic and agricultural hub for the country in its early days, decades of neglect have led to a regressive state.
“Dregerhafen secondary is the only secondary school within Finschhafen district,” stated Cr Narekine. “There are lower secondary schools like Hube’s Pindiu Agro High School and the newly-established Burum High School and Dreger high school. For upper secondary, we only have Dregerhafen.”
“The main problem we are facing now is that, most of our kids who were at Dreger, are now back at home with us because of school fighting.
“School fighting has been continuous and has affected our children. For instance, Sattelberg circuit is a circuit within the Lutheran church that looks after Het Mape – which is Mape LLG under the government – and the entire Sattelberg and one parish under Tewai-Siassi district.
“This year and in the previous years, not one student from this circuit had successfully passed to university. And that’s a major problem.”
Cr Narekine outlined that since the Early Childhood and Junior Primary Teachers Training Centre has moved its students to Wampar, in Huon Gulf district, the teaching facilities are now free. He therefore suggested that the church support them and establish a secondary school for the circuit and surrounding areas at Heldsbach.
Former Yangpela Didiman extension coordinator, Hune Made, believes that reviving the agricultural program at Heldsbach would create a pathway for the many unemployed youth. He says this is the best approach to utilising our youth and keeping them busy in the rural districts instead of letting them drift to urban areas.
Meantime, Narekine, who is also a member of the Finschhafen District Development Authority, said a memorandum of understanding was signed with ELCPNG in June 2023.
“The first K100,000 was given to the church to conduct a land survey here at Heldsbach,” he continued. “The main idea is that, because this property belongs to the church, the DDA will not step in unless the church gives its approval.”
“FDDA has its eyes on the Heldsbach facilities but under the MoU, K500,000 will be paid to the church to conduct surveys, then divide the land areas; authorising the FDDA to develop an allocated portion.
“The first payment has already been made; hence the process is underway.”"
Beon inmates receive support ahead of Independence Day,26/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5780,,Community,Joy,Nill,"The Beon Correctional Services Institution in Madang Province has received support from business houses to host its 50th Independence celebrations on September 16.
Brian Bell donated sports gear over the weekend and today saw Sigma Constructions adding to the sporting gear with more donations.
Brian Bell donated balls and equipment for the sport of basketball, soccer, rugby and volleyball while Sigma Construction’s donation today included  two goal posts for soccer and two balls.
The Beon Correctional Institution will host their own celebration with activities like sports, arts, entertainment and music planned for the occasion. Their celebrations will run from the 08th to the 16th of September on the facility grounds.
Beon Commander Jackson Gubag thanked both business houses for their kind gesture towards the inmates who have worked tirelessly to organize their activities. As part of the rehabilitation program, the inmates were tasked to plan and execute the country’s 50th Independence Anniversary for the prison and have been working hard to ensure this is done. The donation is a boost to their hard work.
He also added that they will continue to forge a strong relationship in order to support each other in future for rehabilitation and social development in the long run.
Tony Defrancisco from Brian Bell said that it is not the first nor the last time Brian Bell will be supporting Beon Correctional as they continue to prioritize their community obligations towards the communities within Madang. Much more so, he was grateful that they are able to support the inmates in ensuring their festivities go well with new equipment.
“We are glad that we are able to assist the inmates so that they are able to enjoy their event with pride. We’ve been around and we’ll always be around and happy to support our correctional institution,” stated Mr. Defrancisco.
The inmates were also grateful towards the donors, stating that they are now empowered to participate in all the sporting codes.
The public and surrounding areas of Beon have been invited to participate in the prison’s independence program from the 08th to the 16th of September 2025.,"
DWU celebrate two more upstanding alumni,25/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5766,,Education,Joy,Nill,"Eddie Tanago Paine and Josiah Pup Moiya were the proud recipients of the Divine Word University 2025 Alumni of the year award. Both were recognized during DWU’s celebration of its Foundation Day on Thursday 21st August. Paine and Moiya are former students who attained bachelors in PNG and International Relations Studies under the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. They graduated in 2008 and 2017 respectively.
DWU President Professor Fr. Philip Gibbs said every year the Alumni never ceases to amaze with undeniable traits that bring forward positive change and development into the country, a reflection of the institution’s legacy and rapport.
Moiya is an entrepreneur from the Western Highlands province, currently providing employment opportunities from his security firm, Armed Seal Group which has now spanned into four key industries of security, construction, finance and real-estate.
Despite graduating with a Bachelors in PNG Studies, Pup did not wait for employment, but rather created it. Since then, he has expanded his business from Mt Hagen to Jiwaka and Chimbu, and plans to expand into Lae, Madang and Port Moresby. His story resounds of grit and determination in today’s society where graduates outnumber job opportunities. His story is about social purpose - to be the solution, especially for those society often overlooks. He actively supports local churches, helps fund community development efforts, and personally pays school fees for children from struggling families as an investment in a better PNG, rather than as a charity case.
For the Campaign Manager for ACT NOW PNG, it was always about doing the right thing. Mr. Paine is a leading voice in PNG’s civil society landscape, known nationally and internationally for his tireless work defending customary land rights, promoting environmental justice, and championing ethical development. He is one of PNG’s most vocal advocates and leads efforts to expose land and forest exploitation, particularly the abuse of Special Agriculture and Business Leases (SABL) and Forest Clearing Authorities, which have stripped communities of their land and resources without consent.
Recently this year, Mr. Paine became a public figure in the defence of civic space after a criminal charge—widely seen as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP)—was dismissed by the courts. The case, stemming from his role in raising public awareness about forestry malpractice, served to underline his unwavering stand for truth and public interest.
The DWU Alumnae awards are given each year to nominees who have had an outstanding impact within their professional career space. It is also a recognition of the practiced values instilled by Divine Word University, provoking development and positive impact in the country or internationally.
After the formalities, both awardees’ names were unveiled at the Alumnae Park amongst other names of recognized alumnae."

"Madang Provincial Government Backs Polio Immunization with K150,000",25/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5762,,Health,Trust,Nill,"The Madang Provincial Government has provided K150,000 to support the province’s polio immunization campaign, with funds also directed towards routine immunization.
Madang Provincial Health Authority (MPHA) Chief Executive Officer, Dr Martin Daimen, made the announcement during the presentation of the cheque by Provincial Administrator, Daniel Aloi, last week.
Dr Daimen said the funding would assist health teams to carry out routine immunization alongside the polio campaign.

Renewed commitment to human dignity,25/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5765,,Government,Trust,Nill,"Conversations deepen for Gender based violence, sorcery accusation-related violence, family protection and child rights, gender equality, and the rights of persons with disabilities with the launch of the National Human Rights Strategy 2024-2029 in Port Moresby recently.
Secretary for the Department of Justice and Attorney General Dr Eric Kwa, said the strategy is aligned with the Medium-Term Development Plan IV, particularly strategic priority area 5 on law and justice.
Over the years, steps have been taken to address critical issues such as gender-based violence, sorcery accusation-related violence, family protection, child rights, gender equality, and the rights of persons with disabilities. This strategy builds on those efforts and places human rights at the heart of national priorities.
According to the Secretary for the Department of Justice and Attorney General Dr Eric Kwa, the strategy ensures greater access to justice for vulnerable groups, including women, children, persons with disabilities, people in rural areas, and those who are socially and economically disadvantaged.
Secretary Kwa said a human rights secretariat has been established under the justice department’s corporate plan 2019 to 2024. The secretariat has three major responsibilities to establish a policy, push for the human rights institute, and promote the human rights agenda.
“Looking back in history, we realized we did not have a permanent place for the human rights secretariat and the work on human rights, so we offered as a department to take on the responsibility to work on the human rights institute and the strategic. Since 2020, we've been slowly establishing the human rights secretariat made up of like-minded individuals who have performed extremely well. A result of their hard work is seen through the launching of the human rights strategy,” he said.
Dr Kwa added that the launching of the strategic plan marks the beginning of a renewed national commitment to human dignity, reflecting Papua New Guinea’s constitutional values, and ensures the state fulfills its duty as the primary guardian of rights."

Free carry equity for Cloudy Bay,23/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5749,,Business,Joy,Nill,"For the first time ever since the inception of the Papua New Guinea Forest Authority 33 years ago, the forestry sector is in the process of issuing a timber permit to be managed under Forest Management Agreement, to state-owned company - PNG Diwai Holdings Limited (PNGDHL), the authority’s business arm.
The PNGDHL will be the developer for the Amau Ganai Riwari FMA Project in the Cloudy Bay area of Central Province with the company to free carry equity for the resource owners, another first in the forestry sector. The project is a pilot with plans to replicate this method of project delivery in other areas if proven successful.
PNGFA Managing Director John Mosoro officially opened the project negotiations between PNGFA, PNGDHL and the resource owners, on Friday, 15th August, 2025. Mr Mosoro who is also PNGDHL’s Interim Executive Chairman described the occasion as historic.
“As the PNGFA Managing Director, it gives me great pleasure to stand before you all to officially open negotiations for the Amau Ganai Riwari FMA which will be the first project to be funded by the government through PNGDHL,” he said. “This idea for the government to manage its own projects started while I was the Director for Policy at the Prime Minister’s Department and we moved it to PNGFA.”
“PNGDHL is now a fully-fledged company established under the business law of the country.
Addressing the resource owners, he said, “For the first time in any PNG forestry project, you will sign with the State.”
Previously, the State signed with developers, while the resource owners were mere spectators, but in this instance, State will sign with the resource owners.
PNGDHL Chief Operating Officer Verolyn Daugil said, “This is the first time for a state company in the forestry sector to take up a project and history in the making for the sector that it will free carry the resource owners’ equity in the project, which will see majority of the benefits go to the resource owners.”
The whole-day project negotiations took place after four weeks of consultation between PNGFA and the resource owners. Prior to this, the authority through its Forest Acquisition and Allocations Directorate has for over two years been working with the resource owners, leading up to Friday’s negotiations.
Mr. Mosoro said, “This is a first for the forestry sector since the 1992 Forestry Act.
“PNGDHL will now go into equity participation for landowners. You will get your royalties and levies but PNGDHL will free carry your equity, so you will have shares in PNGDHL, as added benefits.
“We started with a project in Central Province because it is easy to go back and forth to sort out issues that may arise. I hope that when other resource owners throughout the country see the success of this project, they will want to participate also.
“Today is a very important occasion for the government, PNG and the landowners now that we will involve landowners meaningfully in the development of their forest resources. This is how we will take back PNG in the forest sector by ensuring meaningful participation by landowners as the government implements its policies down to ground level.
“I thank the National Forest Board and Minister Waipo for agreeing for this project to be the first for resource owners to sign with the state. This is a historical moment.
“I want this project to be unique and different from the rest that have been signed with other developers in the past. The negotiations must ensure resource owners get maximum benefit,” MD Mosoro told the meeting.
Mr. Miller Bonou, the Chairman for Amau Ganai and the landowner representative who spoke during the occasion was happy with this new development saying: “Life in our area is very difficult. We are still living like our forefathers. I have been talking with PNGFA about this project for the last five years and am happy for the negotiations today. We need basic services.”
Deputy District Administrator for Abau Mr. Trevor Tararau in support of Mr. Bonou said: “Our people need development in the districts. It’s 50 years since our country’s independence and we need positive changes in the way our people live.”
Speaking about the engagement of PNGDHL in the project, Mr. Tararau said: “it is often difficult to negotiate for the betterment of our people when permit holders are foreign owned. Logging agreements in Abau have been partly fulfilled to a certain degree. I am therefore happy that the government through PNGDHL is driving a new course of forestry in PNG.

Australia helps boost PNG Customs Border Protection Capabilities,23/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5746,,Security,Trust,Nill,"PNG Customs will soon have a Detector Dog Facility following the ground breaking ceremony today in Port Moresby.
With support from Australia, this is a step forward in strengthening border security along PNG borders to help deter criminal syndicates.
Speaking at the ceremony in Port Moresby, Australian High Commission’s Andrew Bailey, said the initiative reflects the deep and longstanding partnership between Australia and Papua New Guinea, highlighting the work of detector dogs in in protecting borders.
“Detector dogs are a proven, highly effective tool in protecting borders, deterring criminal syndicates, and safeguarding communities.”
“As PNG approaches its 50th anniversary of independence, this program is another example of how our two nations stand together – yumi stap wantaim – to build a safer and more secure region,” Mr Bailey said.
The Australian Border Force Detector Dog Program, recognised internationally as a World Customs Organisation Regional Dog Training Centre, has been working closely with PNG Customs to establish professional capability.
This includes the recruitment of PNG Customs detector dog handlers, training and supervision opportunities, including participation in the Pacific Detector Dog Program Forum in Fiji, supporting the development of operational procedures, training, and animal welfare standards and assisting in the design of the new facility.
Australia will also support PNG Customs by gifting ABF-bred detector dogs.
Mr Bailey said detector dogs play a critical role in combating transnational crime.
“From narcotics and firearms to illicit tobacco and explosives, detector dogs are a powerful non-intrusive screening tool that can complement and, in some cases, replace technological solutions,” he said.
The initiative is expected to strengthen PNG’s border enforcement, disrupt criminal syndicates, and contribute to economic stability through enhanced revenue collection."

Marape acknowledges PNG judiciary,22/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5743,,Politics,Trust,"James Marape, Michael Somare","Prime Minister James Marape has reaffirmed the independence of Papua New Guinea's judiciary as the foundation of national unity, democracy, and sovereignty, declaring it the better arm of government that has safeguarded the nation for the past 50 years.
Speaking at the opening of the International Conference on Judicial Integrity and Well-being in Port Moresby, Prime Minister Marape welcomed judges, legal scholars, and practitioners from PNG and abroad, emphasising that the rule of law remains the anchor of the country's stability since Independence in 1975.
""We are an ancient civilisation, but as we fused into one nation in 1975, it has been the judiciary that underpinned the stability and oneness of our country,"" he said.
Prime Minister Marape traced PNG's journey from its ancient cultural heritage to modern statehood, noting that the judiciary has been central to maintaining order in one of the most linguistically and culturally diverse countries on earth.
""Our diversity of over one thousand tribes, more than 800 languages, and hundreds of islands has been bound together by one Constitution and one judiciary,"" Prime Minister Marape said.
""For 50 years, the courts have been the safeguard of our freedoms, our unity, and our democracy. They remain the final arbiter when politics is divided.""
The Prime Minister highlighted that PNG's Constitution remains ""the most reverent piece of law in our land"" and has endured with fewer than 50 amendments in half a century.
Recalling his own political career, Prime Minister Marape credited the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare for instilling respect for judicial authority in times of political tension.
""In 2011, when stress emerged between Parliament, the Executive, and the judiciary, Sir Michael told us: 'The court is always right.
Let's go to court and respect the court.' That lesson has been deeply ingrained in me,"" Prime Minister Marape reflected.
The Prime Minister outlined several reforms aimed at strengthening the judiciary, including: raising the retirement age of judges to 72, with plans to extend to 75; establishing a new Court of Appeal between the National and Supreme Courts; increasing judicial appointments to more than 200 nationwide; ensuring judicial administration is financially and operationally independent of the Executive; and investing over K700 million in the new national courthouse in Waigani, which will incorporate technology and accommodate the new appellate structure.
The new national courthouse in Waigani, to be officially opened on September 12, will not simply be a physical structure. It is designed as a technology-driven hub that will link all court centres across the country through ICT, with integrated connections to magisterial services and police reporting systems. More than a building, it symbolises Papua New Guinea's commitment to an independent, modern, and functional judiciary. The September opening will mark a new direction for the nation's justice system, setting a framework that will serve the country for the next 50 years.
Prime Minister Marape assured the judiciary of full government support, saying: ""We cannot afford to weaken the independence of our judiciary. In a nation as diverse as ours, there must be one rule book, one reader of law, and one authority - the judiciary.""
The Prime Minister also urged regional cooperation, inviting Pacific Island nations to share resources, expertise, and judicial functions.
He said PNG, with its extensive court system ranging from village courts to the Supreme Court, is ready to support neighbours in strengthening the rule of law.
“Fifty years on, the role of the judiciary is greater than ever. Our democracy, sovereignty, and national unity depend on it. The judiciary will continue to be the safety net for our people and the anchor of our nation's future,” Marape added."

PNG’s exports to Solomon Islands last year was valued at K112.5 million and Marape said as Melanesian brothers, the countries should support each other and the K20m funding support is in line with this notion.

ENBPHA conclude Public Finance Management Training,21/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5734,,Health,Trust,Nill,"The East New Britain Provincial Health Authority (ENBPHA) has completed its Public Finance Management training for its health workers serving in the Pomio district. Held at Palmalmal station, the four-day training is part of the ENBPHA’s continued efforts to strengthen financial governance and accountability.  The training targeted health workers (Officer in Charge, Sister in Charge and Clerks) who are involved in managing or handling public funds at the district level.
The Public Finance Management guidelines include eleven recently endorsed Public Finance Management policies and procedures, including cash advance, procurement, fraud, and risk management, among others. These policies were designed to enhance compliance, efficiency, and transparency in financial practices across all levels of the health system. Health Services Improvement Program (HSIP) Officer Emmanuel Sialis, described the value of the training.
“With the support of the PNG Australia Transition to Health Program, we successfully rolled out this training in four districts. Our frontline health workers are trained clinicians, and they often lack the financial skills to manage their day-to-day operation needs, which is an important aspect of healthcare delivery. That’s why we are working closely with partners to help our staff understand key financial process and policies, including delegation of authority, procurement, fraud prevention, internal audit, and risk management, so that they would be in a better position to access funding for their respective health facilities,” Sialis said.
“This training is a critical step in ensuring that our health workers serving in rural areas are fully equipped with the knowledge and tools to manage public funds responsibly and transparently.”
The Public Finance Management rollout is part of the Corrective Action Plan (CAP) developed with support from the Australian Government through the PNG Australia Transition to Health (PATH), and Deloitte, following a review of ENBPHA’s financial systems.
Key outcomes included increased confidence in financial accountability, awareness of operational policies, and readiness to implement standardised procedures. The training also emphasised continuous monitoring, supportive supervision, and digital reporting pathways to strengthen transparency and resource management.
Health Extension Officer Victor Talmane of Sivauna Health Centre attended the training. Victor joined ENBPHA in 2019 but hadn't been aware of the PHA's financial processes until attending the workshop. Enthusiastic that he can now understand processes, mitigate risks, understand the role of documents when accessing funds, he feels more confident in his ability to run the health centre well.
“Health is everyone’s business, and with the support from Australia and other partners working hand in hand with the PHA, we can progress health, especially at the district level,” he says.
“When there’s a shortfall, our partners come to support. And I’m thankful that Australia, through its PATH program, is working with us at the provincial level to improve our systems and processes so we, as frontline health workers serving in remote areas, can be able provide better health care services in our rural communities.’’
Wayne Polout, HEO at Palmalmal Health Rural hospital reflected on the added value of the training for staff in rural areas.
“This is training is important to us especially for Health Extension Officers and OICs who are in charge of the health facilities in rural areas. This is adding value to our skills so we can improve managing our facilities and understand the processes of governance and accountability properly.
It’s good to have partners working with our PHA to fill in those gaps. At the end of the day, it’s the health of our people that matters.’’
Meanwhile, Mr Sialis says these policies will foster improved governance, reduce financial risks, promote transparency, and build capacity at the facility level, leading to more efficient and accountable financial management in health services.
“After this training, we at the PHA will see improvements in our Officers’ accessing of funds. This system-strengthening initiative will transform our approach to what we are doing at the provincial level, with long-term impact on the services we can provide and the health of our communities.”"

Plea for road access,21/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5730,,Development,Sadness,Nill,"When the word ‘highway’ is used, an image of a long stretch of road immediately comes to mind. But not for the people of rural Huon Gulf district in Morobe Province.
For them, the Markham River is their highway as they travel down in motorised dugout canoes, called ‘mon’, to get food supplies, building materials, to access education and health services or to transport their cash crops like cocoa and coffee.
With the country preparing to celebrate 50 years of independence, all the people of Ngaraguma, Chiats and Mafanazo want, is road accessibility for the Watut River communities.
Kisa Giwisa, from Chiats village, in Wampar LLG, was helping to load cargoes onto the ‘mon’ at around 6.30pm after a three-hour trip from Lae, in preparation for the over 1-hour of cold and rough journey home against the current.
“We move around using three types of transportation; we come on the canoe, we leave it then get on a vehicle to go to the main highway at 40-Mile. At 40-Mile, we get on PMVs to go to town with our cocoas, garden food, vanilla, gold and other things to go to the market to help ourselves,” he shared.
“In good or bad weather, we move around like this.
“The main challenges we face include wet weather; we get drenched while out on the river, including our store goods. They get wet and damaged.
“Sometimes when we travel down in the morning with our market produce and cash crops like cocoa, the rain would fall.
“Sometimes, when we have engine problems, the canoe would capsize with our cargoes. I’m glad you are here to capture our pain.
“It’s expensive, using three different types of transportation. For example, a piece of roofing sheet bought from CASA Hardware or Mainland Plumbing in Lae, they will charge us K5 per roofing sheet from the highway down, then it’s another K5 per sheet from 40-Mile to the river, then another K5 per sheet when loading it onto the canoe to take to the village.
“This means it will cost K15 to move just one roofing sheet. So, imagine if I were to move 20 roofing sheets. It would cost a lot, that’s why I have to really save up if I want to do that.
“Even these steel posts here,” he gestured to a pile on the ground. “We have to really budget for these building materials.”
Giwisa said it would be a dream-come-true for his people if they could use only one type of transport to move to and from town, not to mention the money they can save from this.
“It is the cry of the Watut River communities to have a good road and bridge,” continued Giwisa. “We hope our MP can help us and bring these services to us so we can move without difficulty to access goods and services.
“We hope that this pain, felt by our forefathers and now us, will soon be a thing of the past.”"

Twenty-one-year-old Sean Rolpagarea was identified by police in a viral video of PNGUoT male students harassing a mentally challenged young woman on campus between 7.30pm and 8.30pm on August 9.
He was charged with one count of sexual touching.
Rolpagarea, dressed in a blue button-down shirt, appeared before Magistrate Grace Peu at 10.33am today, in the Lae committal court, for his second mention.
Police prosecution, first constable Maureen Pohei, submitted that since Rolpagarea does not have a permanent residence in Lae, he is a “flight risk”.
In their bail reply, police prosecution said the defendant is unlikely to appear in his trial if granted bail.
“Given the circumstance of the defendant, he is a student at the PNG University of Technology,” said Pohei.
“He resides at the university campus. He is a flight risk and the court should consider before extending his bail or converting his police bail to court bail.”
However, prosecution submitted that the following bail conditions should be considered by the court if the court wishes to grant bail:
•	K5,000 bail to be imposed due to the seriousness of the offence
•	The defendant to only reside at the PNG University of Technology campus
•	The defendant to report to the officer-in-charge of prosecution every fortnight Tuesday between 8am-4pm.

After listening to both submissions, Magistrate Peu outlined that she is using her discretion, as permitted by the Bail Act, to have the defendant’s bail further allowed.
“Police bail is now converted to court bail,” she stated. “I will increase the amount from K2,000 to K3,000 cash bail and I will attach conditions to the bail.”

The three-day conference, which begins today, is a follow-up to the Regional Judicial Conference held in Nauru from 24 to 26 July 2024 and the adoption of the Nauru Declaration on Judicial Well-Being on 25 July 2024.
The conference will be supported by the Papua New Guinea Centre for Judicial Excellence and UNODC under the framework of the Pacific Platform on Anti-Corruption: the Teieniwa Vision and aligned with the objectives of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), particularly article 11, which underscores the importance of enhancing integrity within the judiciary. The event aims to identify additional challenges, strengthen existing networks, and deepen insights into the needs of judges and judiciaries, fostering a more robust and integrity-driven judicial system.
According to the UNODC Pacific, Head of Office, Regional Anti-Corruption Advisor Marie Cauhois, the conference will bring together judges, judicial authorities, and experts from around the world, with a particular emphasis on the Pacific region. Participants will discuss emerging trends and challenges related to judicial integrity and well-being.
Cauhois said key topics to be explored during the conference include judicial integrity and judicial well-being, including how they are interconnected and strengthen one another.
“We will also look at the internal pressures affecting the judiciary in terms of trauma that are coming from judges and magistrates when dealing with sensitive issues every day in court.
“Another topic we will discuss is on AI, how we can use AI to help judges, and the challenges of using AI,” she said.
Cauhois said they are hopeful that the participants will share insightful issues and challenges faced in their respective courtrooms and that they will build good relationships to support each other when the need arises."
ENB police reservists undergo training,20/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5715,,Law,Trust,Nill,"Training for selected police reservists in East New Britain Province began on Monday, August 18, and will run for eight weeks at the Gunan na Niuvia (GNN) facility in Kokopo. Two-hundred-and-twenty-six applicants have been shortlisted and are currently undergoing induction.
Program coordinator and provincial law and order programs officer, Romalus Tavui, confirmed the details last week, saying the program’s objective is to strengthen the capacity and effectiveness of reserve police personnel, to maintain law and order, whilst promoting community safety and the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
“The 262 shortlisted candidates fall into three main categories — National Reservists, Corporate Reservists, and Community Auxiliary Police (CAP),” Tavui explained.
Roles of the reservist categories:
•	National reservists will serve full-time alongside regular police officers, assisting in daily law enforcement duties.
•	Corporate reservists are professionals already in the workforce, whose expertise can support the RPNGC and its administration. This group includes doctors, former police officers, retired government officers, and other specialists.
•	Community Auxiliary Police (CAP) will be based at Local Level Governments (LLGs) and ward areas. They are respected community members selected for their leadership and contributions to local safety and order.
The eight-week program will combine theory and practical training.
Tavui noted that the reservists’ roles are guided by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed earlier this year between the East New Britain Provincial Government (ENBPG) and the RPNGC.
“As part of the MoU, the ENBPG is responsible for funding the program, including paying the allowances of all 262 reservists in the province,” he outlined.
Reservists will carry out their duties under the supervision of regular police officers, with one regular officer assigned to oversee groups of up to four (4) reservists.
Upon completing the training, they will be deployed to LLGs and districts with existing police posts.
Tavui confirmed that several hotspot areas have been identified for deployment, including Gelagela, where a police post is already in place.
The program will also serve as a recruitment pool for future police intakes, with the possibility of outstanding reservists being called up for full police training."
"Remove tinted windows, directs ENB authorities",20/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5713,,Crime,Fear,Nill,"The escalating lawlessness in East New Britain Province has prompted authorities to direct that all tinted windows in public motor vehicles (PMVs) and taxis be removed.
ENB Provincial Administrator, Levi Mano, who is also the chairman of the provincial licensing committee of the National Road Traffic Authority board, is encouraging all licenced PMV and taxi operators to heed the call.
“This will allow for clear visibility for all road users of this public sector service, while it acts as a deterrent to future illegal activities,” outlined Mano.
“Whilst law enforcement agencies of government continue to conduct their work in addressing the situation in law and order in the province, the ENBPLC and the government expects compliance in this nature, as one approach towards dealing with this matter.”
Mano iterated that all stakeholders should collectively work towards restoring public safety, trust and confidence in this public sector transport service.
“Compliance to this instruction/directive is effective immediately, as of Wednesday, August the 13th, and shall be performed by the police department, both the national and provincial road traffic/ transport authorities and line agencies.”
Mano also advised that awareness is being implemented and that as of Monday August 18, non-compliance will result in penalties as stipulated for, under the Road Traffic Act of 2014.
Meanwhile, Kokopo Police Station Commander, Senior Inspector Neil Weiba, has called on citizens of East New Britain to work with the Royal PNG Police Constabulary (RPNGC) to provide information on criminals or suspects that are hiding in their villages.
He made these comments following the Kokopo robbery on Monday August 11, that led to the severe wounding and killing of a security guard. Police believe that the ring leader is a 2022 escapee from the Kerevat Correctional Services facility.
“A guard was killed in the process of the armed robbery on Monday. That guard who died, is from the same village as the suspects involved in that incident. So, if people do not come out to give information to police, the very people that they are hiding, will eventually turn around and do something bad to them again,” he said.
Snr Insp. Weiba iterated that even stolen vehicles are reportedly kept in the villages but no one is coming forward with information that will lead to the apprehension of the suspects.
“Police are always looking for information but we cannot forcefully get information from the villagers, because we respect their rights as well. But we do need their assistance to clean up their village (from criminal elements),” he said."
Yafai guilty for not verifying claims before paying Paraka,19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5707,,Politics,Disgust,James Marape,"Former Deputy Secretary of Finance, Jacob Yafai who was charged with four counts of misappropriation and one count of abuse of office has now been found guilty as charged.
Yafai was found guilty for failing to do one simple thing – and that is to verify the payments with the Solicitor General’s office before making the payment.
Chief Justice Sir Salamo injia before handing down his decision read the charges to the former Deputy Secretary was charged for.
Counts 1 to 4 included the dishonest application of different amounts of money over different years to Paul Paraka, who is also serving time on a different charge. Total amount of money paid was K41.8 million kina.
Count 5 was for the abuse of officer.
When assessing the evidence and the arguments presented before the court during the trial, the Chief Justice said the directions from the then Finance Minister and now Prime Minister, James Marape were clear back then through a hand written notation that stated: “Secretary, please peruse, verify and settle”, signed on the 05th of October 2012. The then Secretary, Steven Gibson after citing it on the same day, wrote a notation on the bottom right side of the letter stating: “Deputy Secretary, Verify, confirm, settle”.
The Chief Justice in handing down the verdict told Yafai that the instructions from the then Finance Minister and Secretary through the short notes were clear and that was for him to verify before payment.
Yafai however, failed to verify with the Solicitor General’s office before paying Paraka monies totalling K41.8 million kina.
The office of the Solicitor General is responsible for payments of any brief outs by the state to private law firms and any business should be done in consultation with this government office.
Former Solicitor general, Neville Devete filed a complaint and had Yafai arrested and charged for misappropriation and abuse of office.
Yafai is now out on bail and will return on September 09th for submissions on conviction.
The Probationary Services were also advised to prepare a pre-sentence report together with a means assessment report and be delivered on 09th September to assist the court."
Gandep project progressing well,19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5704,,Development,Anticipation,Ramsey Pariwa,"Ramu District and Madang Province is about to see the birth of a new mission township in the remote Middle Ramu District plains of Gandep.
To enable implementation of the “Gandep Project’ paperwork framework, Provincial Member Ramsey Pariwa and Middle Ramu MP Kansol Kamdaru, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with an incorporated mission-based entity ‘Transform the Nation Ltd Australia’ to implement this project, which will be facilitated by Melanesian Evangelical Church of Christ based in Gandep.
The “Gandep Project’ came about when Jim West Project Director with Transform the National Ltd Australia visited Gandep in 2009. He was appalled at the state of the community, its welfare and that people were dying prematurely from diseases, predominantly malaria, women were dying during childbirth and a sense of isolation pervaded villages.
“After extensive consultation with the local people, Jim and his friends committed to help the Gandep people by working with them to improve the track and so open the possibility of self-sustainable health, education and trade activity in this remote region,” said the Middle Ramu MP.
The ‘Gandep Project’ will see to the reconstruction of a track to an improved all-weather standard one, and to extend and rebuild the grass airstrip at Tsumba village at the Ramu River.
To be developed in nine stages, around 140 volunteers from Toowoomba have worked over the past 10 years to complete stages one and two of the projects and have raised $2.5 million to complete these stages. A further $4 million is required over the three years to complete stages three to six.
Recently machinery arrived in Madang for deployment to the project site. Ongoing consultations have occurred between the Middle Ramu DDA and project partners. Provincial Administrator Daniel Aloi emphasized on the positive impact this project.
To reduce bureaucratic bottle-neck and address compliance issues, Governor Pariwa and MP Kamdaru said they will assist with getting the appropriate support to meet Internal Revenue Commission tax obligation or exemption including addressing Customs and clearance issues to allow shipment of over K5 million worth of heavy equipment and machinery.
This will include motorized barge specifically built to transport fuel, goods and supplies up the Ramu River. The barge alone is valued at $1.6 million and will in future service the Ramu plains to move cargo and cash crops for the Middle Ramu people.
The MOU signing now paves the way for the commencement of the development of a township will service a population of over 20,000 people in 170 villages."
Marape welcomes Court Decision,19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5708,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape who has been a state witness in The State Vs Yafai case since 2013 has welcomed today’s conclusion of the case that found former Deputy Finance Secretary, Jacob Yafai guilty of all five charges.
Describing this decision as a significant milestone in the fight against corruption, he also stated that this case should remind everyone that no one is above the law.
Marape reflected on the day he took up the role of Finance Minister back in 2012, and how he did his bit to reform the system.
“When I first arrived at the Department of Finance as Minister in August 2012, I found a system that had been seriously eroded,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“The department had become a target for paper-pushers and white-collar opportunists who treated it like a money-making machine for the ruling class. From day one, I made it my mission to restore order, streamline processes, and cut off avenues for abuse.”
Among the reforms introduced during his time as Finance Minister were the transition from paper-based to electronic transactions, and new measures to reduce discretionary influence in claim settlements. These reforms, formally launched in 2018, laid the foundation for stronger financial governance.
Now, as Prime Minister, he also highlighted the reforms his government will undertake to tighten the gaps.
“As Prime Minister, I am now directing my government to go even further,” he said. “We will embrace artificial intelligence and ICT platforms in procurement, ensuring that contracts are awarded strictly on merit, not influence. By computerising systems and using AI, we can improve efficiency, close the gate on corruption, and eliminate decades of abuse.”
Commenting on the Paraka case itself, Prime Minister Marape was consistent with the court’s findings, stating that his instructions at the time: “My directive to Finance officers was always clear — verify the claims, and only pay what is genuinely due. If a claim was not valid, then it had to be stopped immediately. The word ‘settle’ did not mean automatic payment; it meant resolving the matter according to the facts.”
The Prime Minister emphasised that while ministers may come and go, the public service remains. Entrenched corruption within parts of the bureaucracy must be rooted out once and for all.
“This judgement comes as Papua New Guinea approaches 50 years of independence,” he said. “It is a timely reminder that no matter how long it takes, justice will prevail. No one can escape accountability if matters are properly investigated and prosecuted.”
Prime Minister Marape also spoke candidly about the risks he faced during his time as Finance Minister, particularly between 2013 and 2015, when he took decisive action to stop questionable and fraudulent payments.
“In standing firm against these illegal claims, I faced serious threats,” he said."
Sinai presents Usino Bundi writ to GG,19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5705,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"The Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission officially returned the writ for the Usino-Bundi Open by-election to Government House today. Vincent Ambane Kumura is the duly elected Member of Parliament for Usino-Bundi.
The Return of Writ today formally concluded the last by-election of the five that were conducted over the past three months.
Chief Electoral Commissioner Simon Sinai presented the writ to the Governor General, in line with the requirements of the Constitution and the Organic Law on National and Local Government Elections.
Sinai thanked election officials led by the Returning Officer and the Assistant Returning Officers for conducting a peaceful by-election despite a few challenges.
""Kumura's election reflects the mandate of the people of Usino-Bundi who turned out in strong numbers to exercise their democratic right. His victory restores the full representation for the electorate in the national parliament,"" he said."
"Court to rule on Opposition leadership case, Wednesday",19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5701,,Politics,Anticipation,"Douglas Tomuriesa, James Nomane","The National Court will hand down its ruling over the leadership battle between Chuave MP James Nomane and Kiriwina-Goodenough MP Douglas Tomuriesa tomorrow morning.
The matter over who should be the Opposition Leader, was heard in court today. Lawyers from both parties presented submissions on whether the national court has jurisdiction to hear the matter or should it be referred to the Supreme Court under section 18 (2) of the Constitution.
Section 18 (2) of the Constitution refers to any question relating to the interpretation or application of any provision of a Constitution law arises in any courts or tribunal, shall, unless the question is trivial, vexatious or irrelevant, refer the matter to the Supreme Court, and take whatever other action including the adjournment of proceedings is appropriate.
Nomane’s lawyer argued that majority of members of parliament had voted for and supported Nomane to be the opposition leader. Their submission stated that it’s the numbers that dictate parliamentary democracy and that it is a simple factual matter that does not cause or raise any questions or issues on the interpretation of section 64 (2) of the Organic Law on Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates (OLIPAC).
They submitted that the facts of the case are not in dispute or complicated and the law on section 64 (2) of the OLIPAC has already been interpreted and applied by the Supreme Court so any potential or perceived issue or question concerning section 64 (2) of the OLIPAC law is trivial, vexatious, and irrelevant to make referral to the Supreme Court for determination within the ambit and meaning of section 18 of the constitution.
Tomurisea's lawyer argues that the case involves the interpretation of section 64 (2) of the OLIPAC, and that the relevant law is section 18 of the Constitution, which states that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to the exclusion of other courts. Therefore, the proceedings must be dismissed as the national court has no jurisdiction to hear the matter, or refer it to the Supreme Court to rule on the matter.
Presiding judge Justice John Carey deferred the matter to tomorrow after hearing submissions from the parties."

Gifting of the King’s colours,19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5702,,Diplomacy,Trust,Justin Tkatchenko,"The gifting of the King’s colours from the British High Commission to Papua New Guinea is a significant diplomatic gesture, symbolizing the strong ties between the United Kingdom and PNG.
British High Commissioner Anne Macro’s presentation of this honour to Minister for Foreign Affairs Justin Tkatchenko underscores the ongoing collaboration and partnership between the two nations.
The King’s colours, a symbol of royal authority and recognition, can have various implications, including fostering goodwill, enhancing cultural exchanges, and promoting mutual understanding.
This ceremony not only highlights the shared history and diplomatic relations but also serves to strengthen those ties in the context of contemporary geopolitical dynamics.
Tkatchenko when giving his speech said Papua New Guinea continues to engage with international partners and such gestures can play an important role in affirming its connections and enhancing its visibility on the global stage.
“This event may also encourage further cooperation in areas such as trade, security, and development, ultimately benefiting both countries and their respective populations,” Minister Tkatchenko said."
PNG Constitution 50 years old,19/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5698,,Politics,Trust,"James Marape, Michael Somare","The PNG Constitution or “Mama Law” is as old as the country, but by a month, celebrating its birth on the 15 August 2025.
The PNG Constitution was adopted on 15 August 1975 following hundreds of consultations around the country.
Prime Minister James Marape in commemorating this important day expressed how men with great minds stood together to put together a document that holds a country with diverse cultures and languages together, even after 50 years.
In preparation for independence in 1975, members of the House of Assembly formed the Constitutional Planning Committee in 1972, headed by the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare as the Chair and Fr John Momis as the Deputy Chair of the Committee. Sir Michael was also the Chief Minister in the House of Assembly.
Following more than 2000 submissions and hundreds of consultations around the country – the first and the last time public consultations of this magnitude were conducted in the country – the document was ready for submission in 1974.
On August 13, 1974, Deputy Chair of the Committee Fr John Momis submitted the final report to the Chief Minister Sir Michael Somare recommending the adoption of the constitution for the soon-to-be-independent state of Papua New Guinea.
Prime Minister James Marape in commemoration of the day, took time to read this report that led to the adoption of the Constitution on August 15, 1975 – four weeks before the birth of PNG as a nation.
“Constitution precedes our national birth – and so today (15 August 2025) is very important. It must be engrained in our national conversations and our national calendar every year to honor the living document that has framed, shaped and molded our country to what we are today,” the Prime Minister said during his address to the nation on August 15, 2025.
All members of the planning committee have passed on except for three included Fr John Momis, now Dr, Sir John Kaputin and Toni Ila who are still alive. Prime Minister Marape acknowledged these men for their work.
“And I want to say today, looking back 50 years on, there aren’t too many complains on our constitution’s ability to maintain individual citizens’ rights to exist in our country in total freedom.”
He emphasized the importance of this constitution that now sees PNG enjoying a vibrant democracy, with a clear separation of powers between the three arms of government.
“The constitution demarcates our borders, the constitution reflects our national symbols, the constitution gives spirit to our national vision and what we as a country aspires for – for instance the five-point plan, the national goals that we have inside – the constitution secures every citizen’s right.”
He described these generation of leaders the greatest who have lived and challenged citizens to be proud Papua New Guineans.
“Just because the flag was lowered and not torn, just because there was no gun fight or no blood loss, no exchange of stressful contest between administration in Canberra and our intention for self-rule here in Waigaini, NCD and PNG mustn’t give us lackluster, low patriotic view of our country”.
Looking to the next 50 years, the Prime Minister reminded Papua New Guineans to ask themselves what they can do for the country to make it a better place for their children.
“The best contribution the government, civil servants, clergy men and all of us in the country – the best contribution young generations can give to your country and all of us present – is to forever live under the shade of this constitution which fathers, mothers and founders of our country birthed on this day 50 years ago. This is the punch line! This is the conversation!” Marape said.
The Prime Minister also called on current and future leaders not to manipulate the constitution to suit their convenience, instead should uphold its values."

Manning said five people were brutally murdered during the fight. He described the tragedy as a disgrace because once again, it is the failure of local leadership in controlling their tribesmen.

Community safety initiatives,18/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5690,,Local,Trust,Powes Parkop,"NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab, is strongly encouraging city residents in suburbs, settlements, and communities to initiate community-based safety initiatives such as the Gerehu-for-Gerehu (G4G) and the City Wardens, to safeguard their neighborhood to help reduce crime.
Simatab said that whether it's forming a neighbourhood watch, establishing community patrols, or simply setting up clear lines of communication with their local police station, contributes to a safer city.
""Effective policing is not just about responding to crime; it's about building strong, resilient communities where citizens and police work hand-in-hand,"" stated Superintendent Simatab. ""I have been incredibly impressed by the dedication and commitment shown by these City Wardens and the members of Gerehu 4 Gerehu.”
“These initiatives are powerful examples of what can be achieved when communities take ownership of their safety and work collaboratively with the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
""The NCDC Warden Program, under the leadership of Governor Honourable Powes Parkop, the National Capital District Commission (NCDC) and the District Development Authorities has made a tangible difference in enhancing public safety at critical transit points and public spaces. Their visible presence, efforts to discourage illegal activities, and support for vulnerable individuals are invaluable. These wardens serve as the 'eyes and ears' of our frontline police officers, significantly extending our reach and ability to maintain order.
""The G4G initiative is a testament to the power of grassroots community action. This neighbourhoods watch program, driven by concerned residents, has shown remarkable results in a suburb that once faced significant law and order challenges. Their robust network, real-time reporting to police, and dedication to creating a safer environment for their families are truly inspiring. G4G's ability to operate largely on volunteer effort and their focus on youth engagement and crime prevention are models we wish to see replicated.
""The success stories of the City Wardens and G4G underscore a fundamental truth, we cannot fight crime alone,"" Superintendent Simatab emphasized. ""The police require the active support and participation of every citizen. I strongly encourage all suburbs, settlements, and communities across Port Moresby to organize similar community-based safety initiatives.”
Further information on how communities can initiate or strengthen their own safety programs, including access to police liaison officers and resources, will be made available through local police stations."
50 Years of Silence Broken; “We Are No Longer Forgotten”,18/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5689,,Development,Hope,Alexander Suguman Orme,"Hidden deep in the Adelbert Range and accessible only by a two-day trek through thick jungle from Sewan, Wanambre is a place where life demands physical strength, and survival is a shared legacy. With no road, no proper schools, no health posts, and no government infrastructure, the people of Winembre have endured this in silence. Until now.
Member for Sumkar Alexander Suguman Orme was able to visit the community last Thursday 14 August. It was the first time a member of parliament has ever visited Wanambre and clearly this will be etched into the local history.
“We see leaders drive past, fly over, talk in town — but none came here,” said one local elder. “Today, that changed. Today, we are no longer forgotten.”
Orme visited Wanambre to officially close the Lutheran Wanuma Circuit Conference. Through powerful storytelling, dance, and drama, the people of Wanambre illustrated their greatest need; a road – a road to access better education, better health care, markets, and a bright future.
During these plays they showed how mothers would walk for days to get medicine, and how children would miss out on school because of the long distances. These struggles eventually leave young people with no ambition or dreams to pursue.
In his address, Mr. Orme pledged support through the Sumkar District Development Authority, assuring the people their pleas have not got unheard.
“I have seen with my own eyes what you go through,” he said. “And I will not leave your voice behind.”
“Development must come here. Your road is not a dream — it is a right,” Orme declared.
He urged the community to remain united and resilient, promising that change will come, but only if they walk together.
As the sun set over the rugged mountains and fires lit up the village below, the people of Wanambre said they felt something they hadn’t in decades — hope.
“This is our 50-year Independence gift,” said one youth leader. “We’ve waited all our lives for this. Now, we believe the road will come — and with it, our future.”"
Government house land protest,18/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5688,,Politics,Anger,"Bob Dadae, Lohia Boe Samuel, Powes Parkop","The clan of Kwaradubuna and Gunina at Hanuabada village staged a peaceful protest at the Government house today to hand over a petition regarding land on which the Government House sits on at Konedobu in the nation’s capital.
Landowners and clan members handed over a petition to Acting Official Secretary to the Government House, Bill Toraso.
Spokesman and principal claimant Arua Loa Boko, emphasized justice for landowners of both clans who were neglected and are seeking justice.
“The main reason we've staged this protest is because of the government's negligence in not attending to our land issues, as you've seen, we staged at the entrance of the Governor General's Office of Residence.
“It's been more than 72 years that our land has been occupied by the government, past governor generals, the current governor general and maybe future governor generals who will be residing on this land,” he said.
According to Boko, the Department of Lands had paid only one family in 2023, when the joint decision in 1953 covers eleven families.
“In 2008 we submitted a submission through the Department of Lands with relevant documents, unfortunately the 10 families were denied by the department and only paid one family.”
They are now seeking fair justice to the traditional landowners. The petition is addressed to the National Executive Council, the Governor General, Sir Bob Dadae, NCD Governor Powes Parkop, North West MP Lohia Boe Samuel and Deputy Governor and Motu Koita Assembly Chairman Russel Wavik.
The Acting Official Secretary to the Government House said he would make sure the petition is given to the prime minister.
“Under the direction of the current governor general, we managed to get one group here, and we progressed their claims here,” he said. “And now that we've got another 10 landowner groups with the petition, I will forward this to the prime minister's office, and they'll take it up from there.”
“As I said, agencies of government are not empowered to purchase land. Where they sit on those matters are dealt by the Department of Lands. And we've written to the Lands department a few times, and I'm sure that the Deputy Prime Minister who is the Minister for Lands is aware of this issue.
“So, this petition will be forwarded to the Prime Minister's office within this week. I sympathize with you people from Hanuabada and the land owners,” Toraso said."
NCD Police set to lead independence security operation,18/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5685,,Security,Anticipation,Nill,"The National Capital District Metropolitan Police Command will take charge of security operations leading up to the nation’s 50th Independence Jubilee Celebrations in September to ensure a safe and secure environment for everyone.
National Capital District Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab said that while this is a time for national pride and unity, our city is facing significant challenges.
He said the NCD Metropolitan Police Command acknowledges that police resources are stretched due to a growing population, an increase in squatter settlements, and high unemployment. These factors have put immense pressure on our policing efforts.
“Currently, we are seeing a concerning rise in crime, including armed robberies, violence linked to ethnic tensions, violence against women and children, and a widespread disregard for road safety. We have identified that many of these crimes are committed by individuals under the influence of alcohol.
“In response to this, and under the direction of the Commissioner of Police and the NCD/Central Divisional Commander, the NCD police have stepped up our operations since last month.  This is a high-impact, high-visibility blitz aimed at putting more officers on the streets to restore public confidence, reduce crime, and ensure law and order,” Metsupt Simatab said.
Key areas of  focus are:
•Ending ethnic violence and conflicts.
•Protecting women and children from harm.
•Enforcing traffic laws and improving road safety.
•Cracking down on anti-social behavior.
•Improving our investigations and prosecution of criminals.
He said law and order is everyone's business, and police are calling on all citizens, communities, women, girls, children, and men to work with the police. He said the police need the public's support to make this a safe and peaceful celebration.
“As part of this strategy, we are working closely with the NCDC through its liquor licensing committee to seek their endorsement to place restrictions on the sale of alcohol, especially in settlements and areas known for alcohol-fueled violence and disorder. This partnership is crucial to ensuring compliance and reducing the harm caused by unethical sales practices. The police are committed to delivering a safe and peaceful Jubilee celebration. We urge all residents of Port Moresby to support our efforts and report any criminal or suspicious activity to the police. Together, we can make our city safe,” Simatab added."
Property of by-election candidate burnt,18/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5687,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"Pastor Joseph Itaki, a candidate who contested the Usino-Bundi Open seat by-election has lost thousands of kina worth of properties to arson, allegedly by supporters of a rival candidate who also lost the race.
According to Ps. Itaki, a group of individuals launched an attack on his supporters at around 4pm on Tuesday August 12 in Ramu. He said the group went ahead and set fire to his permanent house, four vehicles, his outdoor kitchen and building materials for a new building for the Reformation Ministries and Churches Network (RMCN) church. The total cost of the loss is estimated to be K170,000.
The next day, police were deployed to Ramu and apprehended 63 suspects who are now locked up at the Ramu police station. Ps. Itaki says he does not want bail to issued, and that these suspects be transfeered to Madang to be processed.
Ps. Itaki, who had bowed out of the race in the 20th exclusion count, said he accepted that election outcome.
“I do not want trouble; I want perpetrators to be apprehended and the costs of my properties paid by instigators,” he said. “I have told my relatives and supporters to keep calm and maintain peace and let the law and justice take its course.”

PM Calls for Allegiance to Constitution,17/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5680,,Politics,Trust,"James Marape, Michael Somare","Prime Minister James Marape has called on Papua New Guinean’s to recommit to the National Constitution, describing it as the “Mama Law” that binds the nation together and ensures freedom, peace, and equality.
Speaking during a press conference to mark 50 years since the adoption of the Constitution by the House of Assembly on 15 August 1975, PM Marape said the document was the foundation that gave life to Papua New Guinea’s independence a month later on 16 September 1975.
“Our Constitution’s birth ushered in our country’s birth,” PM Marape said. “It must forever be ingrained in our national calendar, in our national conversations, and in the hearts of every Papua New Guinean. It is the living spirit that embodies us all.”
Tribute to Founding Fathers and Mothers
The Prime Minister recalled a 1974 letter from Constitutional Planning Committee  Deputy Chairman Fr John Momis to Chief Minister Michael Somare, urging that the Committee’s report be presented to Papua New Guineans rather than Canberra. He said this showed the boldness of the CPC, paying tribute to its members as “giants who walked before us” and credited them with giving PNG one of the world’s best constitutions. Only three CPC members remain alive—Dr John Momis, Sir John Kaputin, and Tony Ila—who will be honoured during next month’s independence celebrations.
A Call for Respect and Responsibility
PM Marape urged leaders and citizens alike to live under the Constitution’s authority, stressing that no individual, whether Prime Minister, Parliamentarian, or Judge, was above it.
“The Constitution ranks supreme at all times,” he declared. “In our Constitution we find unity, in it we find peace, in it we find the formula for equitable benefit distribution, and in it we find direction for the future.”
He warned against repeating moments of constitutional crisis such as in 2011, when leaders attempted to place themselves above the law, and reminded politicians that the Constitution will always bring them “back in line.”
Constitution as the Nation’s Guide
Highlighting the five National Goals and Directive Principles—integral human development, equality and participation, national sovereignty and self-reliance, wise use of resources and environment, and Papua New Guinean ways—PM Marape said these timeless values continue to guide the nation.
“Our democracy still functions because of the vitality of this Constitution,” he said. “As we look to the next 50 years, we must never take our sovereignty for granted.”
Marape also shared a personal reflection, noting that as a boy living in the remotest areas of Western Province in 1975, he could never have imagined becoming Prime Minister without the equal opportunities enshrined in the Constitution. “Had it not been for this Constitution, children from remote villages like me would never have had such chances,” he said.
Looking Ahead
With four weeks to Independence Day, PM Marape urged citizens to reflect on their duty to the nation. He said the best contribution anyone could make was not only in building roads, bridges, or classrooms, but in respecting the rule of law and living under the Constitution.
“If you ask what you can do for your country, start by respecting the Mama Law,” he said. “Apart from the Bible, the Constitution is the most important document we have. It protects every citizen and ensures our unity as one people, one nation, under one good Constitution.”
He concluded by pledging loyalty to the Constitution and calling on all Papua New Guineans to do the same as the nation prepares to celebrate 50 years of independence next month."
City Warden Initiative Transforms Gordons,17/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5679,,Crime,Trust,Nill,"Crime rate in Gordons area in the nation's capital has seen significant change since the inception of the city warden initiative, says NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab.
Simatab said that in the past, Gordon's was known as one of the notorious areas in the city. Crimes, ranging from minor to serious, were reported there; however, recently, there have been significant changes.
He said Gordon's Police Station Commander, Senior Inspector Gabriel Kini, and his office have been very supportive of the wardens since their engagement there. He mentioned that one of the biggest challenges they face every day at the location is crowd control due to the overwhelming number of vendors the bus stops, shop fronts, and other undesignated areas.
""I am in constant communication with NCDC and other stakeholders on how we can manage the issue of overcrowding at the bus stop, which poses a high risk to the people who are commuting there. I am pleased with how the police and the wardens are working together at the moment. We will try to improve on that by increasing police presence at the location. We are all humans, and we must all work together to find a win-win situation for everyone accessing Gordons, whether to do business or transit to their respective homes, schools, or workplaces,"" Simatab said.
Metsupt Simatab said that with days remaining before the country celebrates fifty years of independence, people's way of doing things must also change. He mentioned that if people are educated but engage in activities that are against the laws of this country, they must sit and reflect in the remaining days and try to change. He emphasized that as one educated person changes, he or she will influence others.
""Most people who are not educated and live in the city still have an educated person from their area whom they look up to as their hero. If you change, the rest of your tribesmen will change. You must stand out and talk to them when they try to do things that are against the law,"" Metsupt Simatab said.
He said the police are trying their best to help ensure everyone in the city receives policing services with whatever resources they have. He stated that the public must continue reporting crimes to the police so they have good statistics to work with to improve their policing services."

The new measures, taking effect from August 16, 2025, are aimed at curbing alcohol-related crimes and ensuring a peaceful environment for both residents and international visitors during the milestone event.
This announcement was made during a press conference led by NCD City Manager Ravu Frank, Committee Chairman and Member for Moresby North East John Kaupa, NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab, and committee member Kwina Ongugo.
Kaupa emphasised that the restrictions were necessary to address persistent law and order issues, particularly in settlements where illegal alcohol sales and social unrest have been prevalent.
“The committee has decided to put restrictions to all the settlement areas and some of the suburbs that also sell alcohol,” he stated.
A list of affected areas will be published in local newspapers.
He added, “The standard fine on illegal selling of alcohol is K500 for every offence, and police will confiscate your stock as evidence.”
Metropolitan Superintendent Simatab noted that Port Moresby’s population has surged to over a million, intensifying policing challenges and leading to a spike in serious crimes, many of them alcohol-related. He outlined increased police operations, including early morning patrols and a focus on hotspots, road safety, and protecting women and children.
“We are partnering with the committee to endorse these restrictions to empower police to enforce liquor operations. This will help us in reducing alcohol related problems,” Simatab explained.

Korean aid program helps Kemabolo community access clean water,16/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5674,,Development,Joy,Nill,"The rural community of Kemabolo in Rigo District has taken a major step towards a climate-resilient future this week with the launch of a KOICA-supported (Korea International CooperationAgenyc)  social services program that will deliver clean water, improve education and health, and strengthen protection services for children.
The program implemented by UNICEF in partnership with the Central Provincial Government, Rigo District Development Authority, Climate Change and Development Authority (CCDA), and the National Department of Planning and Monitoring — will directly reach 30,000 people, including 12,000 children and improve health and education outcomes for nearly 450,000 across the country.
At the heart of the launch, which took place on Wednesday, was the commissioning of a solar-powered water supply system, aiming to deliver safe, reliable water from boreholes to all 250 households in Kemabolo. The system will also supply schools and health facilities, reducing the community’s vulnerability to worsening droughts and floods.
“The Government of Korea has donated money through UNICEF to upgrade the living condition of this village, and I know this project will be a success,” said H.E. Jung Ho Choi, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Papua New Guinea, as he turned on the tap to let water flow from the newly completed boreholes.
The initiative follows a Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (CRVA), which revealed that Kemabolo faces intensive droughts, poor water quality, inadequate sanitation, and limited livelihood opportunities.
Women bear the greatest burden of managing scarce water during prolonged dry periods, while access to climate information and financial services remains minimal.
“For us, water is not simply a resource — it is a daily struggle,” said Joan Gwaibo, Head of the Women’s Committee.
“It was something the women of Kemabolo carried on their backs and in their arms, walking long distances under the scorching sun, often before dawn or after dusk.”
Mackllah Gulu, the school head girl, added: “Water is not just a basic need for life — it is a right. When proper water is supplied to the school, it helps students stay in school, stay healthy, and achieve their dreams, especially girls.”
Despite these challenges, community engagement has been exemplary. Residents already formed a Water User Committee representing youth, women, education, health, and faith leaders. This committee will manage operations, maintenance, and sustainability through a monthly household contribution system.
“Rigo District and Kemabolo can be champions in showing how climate-smart social services can be established and sustained,” said Veera Mendonca, UNICEF Representative.
“This is not just about infrastructure — it’s about local ownership, resilience, and protecting the most vulnerable.”
Deputy Secretary for the National Department of Planning and Monitoring, Michael Kumung, underscored the significance of the project: “Creating a good environment for our children and their communities to enjoy their life is fundamental to our progress going forward in the next 50 years. If we are to reset our country, this is the basic reset we must do at the community level. Providing clean and safe drinking water is where it starts.”
This local initiative is part of the broader UNICEF–KOICA regional climate partnership, launched in May 2024 with a landmark close to US$25 million grant to strengthen climate-smart social services in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and selected African countries.
For Kemabolo, the benefits will include:
• Solar-powered water supply for all households, schools, and health facilities.
• Solarization Solarisation of the school block as an information hub.
• Rehabilitation of the local aid post to restore essential health services.
With the combined efforts of government, partners, and the community, Kemabolo is all set to be an inspiring example of how rural communities can adapt to climate change while protecting children’s futures. “This is not just a campaign — let it be a turning point for the children of Papua New Guinea.”"

SEZA affirms Caution Bay SEZ on state land,15/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5657,,Business,Trust,Rufina Peter,"The Special Economic Zone Authority (SEZA) has refuted claims by the Governor for Central Province, Rufina Peter, regarding the Central Province Industrial Park (Caution Bay SEZ) project.
SEZA in denying these claims said the industrial park, being developed by Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) is situated entirely on State Land and has no legal or operational connection to the Konebada Petroleum Park.
KPHL and SEZA have engaged with relevant State agencies and Laba Holdings Limited, representing impacted local landowners, to ensure that community interests are embedded in the project design.
This includes agreed spin-off benefits such as,
• Construction of a community health clinic;
• Establishment of Police and Fire service stations;
• Direct engagement of local SMEs and skilled labour from surrounding areas.
SEZA also brushed aside claims by the governor that there has been no consultation.
“Engagement has been ongoing with authorised landowner representatives and State bodies responsible for land administration and project approval. “
“As a matter of record, KPHL has the full legal right to develop the site, including the right to determine its project branding. “
The first phase of the Caution Bay SEZ involves a US$145 million investment in a training academy and steel fabrication facility, due for completion in 2026 and the second phase investment will be at the value of US$336.7 million.

Bird sets a course for his future in politics,15/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5661,,Politics,Anticipation,Allan Bird,"East Sepik Governor, Allan Bird has been a vocal and no-nonsense member of parliament over the past eight years but says he has accomplished what he set out to do as a member of parliament when he first entered politics in 2017.
It certainly brought mixed emotions when he announced on his Facebook page on Wednesday, 15 August 2025 that he will contest the national general elections one last time, in 2027.
While he initially said 10 years was enough time to serve the people of East Sepik, the governor in consultation with his more than 127,414 people has conceded to run his last election.
In an exclusive interview with TVWAN Online yesterday, he deliberated further on that decision and his future plans in politics.
“When you set up to achieve something, and when you achieve it, you move on. For me, around 1993 I went home to my village to bury my grandfather, and I saw how poor my people were, not so much in terms of food, but they were cash poor.
“So, I did something about that. I got involved in the vanilla industry, but I realized it wasn't enough. So, when I became governor in 2017, the first thing I wanted to do was how to empower these people and make their lives better.”
In the course of his political career as the governor, Bird helped strengthened the economy by improving agriculture in East Sepik, making it the largest cocoa producer in the country and setting the bench mark, attracting several other provinces in the country to follow suit.
In highlighting other areas of improvement he has witnessed under his administration, he said that the performance of schools in East Sepik have improved and are now ranked higher than before, the health sector has also improved from being the 21st province out of 22 to now being ranked 11th.
“The people of East Sepik have so much money now, village people have money in their pockets. For example, you go to a supermarket and see Ox and Palm are still on the shelves, but if you go to Maprik on a Thursday or Friday all the Ox n Palm are finished as well as other meat products.
“We're not doing brilliantly, but in terms of the current measurement system, we've improved a lot, and we still have a long way to go.”
After close consultation with key supporters in the Sepik and around the country, Governor Bird decided to concede and run his last election and retire in 2032.
“What else am I going to do? Am I going to waste my time in Parliament talking to people who don't understand what I'm trying to say? People who get upset with me for saying what I’m saying? I should be spending my time in more productive pursuits, that's the way I was thinking.
“But I get a lot of messages and when I meet Papua New Guineans, when I come back home in Sepik just going up to some of our villages, opening a little health center, or just meeting people, and they all saying, look you can't leave. You can't abandon us. And then they start crying.
And so I'm like, oh my God, you stop and you start to think again. So, you know, I guess if we're not making other people's lives better, than you know, what's the point of us being here? That's when I started talking to the people back home and said, all right, well, look, maybe one last one - I'll still have enough time to go into retirement.”
Party alignment going forward
And as he looks to continue his political career one more term, Bird also has plans about which party he aligns himself with, expressing his desire to join smaller parties with young like-minded MPs.
“I'm joining a small party, there's two members of parliament in there currently. I don't want to reinvent the wheel, you know. And they've got, you know, you look for like-minded people, and they've got a good organization. The two MPs are young, which is good because then I get to mentor them, because I intend to exit in 2032, I really don't want to stay in politics because it's really nasty business. Papua New Guinean politics is cutthroat. It's tribal, it's vicious.
“Because the members are young, even the executives are young, a lot of my suggestions, they've agreed to, which you won't get in a large party. They don't want to change. So for instance, one of the things we've done is we've paid for some very smart young people to develop an online application. So, you know, I always preach about transparency and good government. So if I'm going to be part of a political party, I want that organization to be transparent and accountable. It starts there.
“The app is already developed. So if someone wants to join our political party, they can go online, become a member, take their photo, load up their details, and it's going to be totally private. If they want to contribute money, they can become financial members. If they want to be just a member and not a financial member, we can also be able to manage that online.
“One of the problems with PNG politics is that after you vote for the Member of Parliament, you have no control over this member of parliament or what he does. We are trying to create something different. Being part of a new party, they're open to new ideas. An example is, if we're going to vote on a bill in Parliament and with a million members online, what we want to do is get that bill, put it onto the site and get the peoples’ ideas and thoughts. This way people can still reach out to Parliament.”
An announcement will be made once formalities are completed at the end of this month."
Milne Bay Coffee jets off to Northern Europe,14/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5650,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"Papua New Guinea’s coffee industry has hit a milestone, with the successful shipment of five tonnes of Daga coffee from Milne Bay to Estonia, Northen Europe.
The inaugural shipment departed Lae on August 14 aboard the Hapag Lloyd vessel, marking a significant achievement for local farmers and the region's agricultural sector.
Graydon Puinam, Founder and General Manager of Gray Cafe Trading, announced that the process took six months to complete, involving the meticulous transport of beans from the remote hinterlands to the international market.
The journey began with handpicked Daga coffee beans, which were carefully transported through a complex logistical network demonstrating the dedication and hard work of local farmers.
Despite several challenges, including limited road access and the need for chartered flights, this shipment represents both the personal sacrifices of the Daga coffee community and their collective effort to establish Daga coffee in the global marketplace. “It’s not just about money; it’s about discovering Daga coffee through our partnership with Estonia,” Puinam stated.
In Estonia, Hannes Saarppu, the proprietor of Renegade Coffee, eagerly anticipates the arrival of the Daga coffee shipment. He plans to market the coffee under his brand, showcasing the unique flavors of Papua New Guinea to European consumers.
This export not only promotes local agriculture but also helps put Milne Bay on the global coffee map with an immense potential for paving the way for future exports and collaborations."
Marape welcomes court ruling,14/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5642,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed yesterday’s National Court ruling confirming that the former Chairman of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL), Dr Benedict Yaru, has no legal standing to continue in that role, having already served the maximum terms permitted under the law.
The Court found that Dr Yaru had served two full terms — a total of nine years — and that the Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited Authorisation Act 2015 “does not allow for a third term for directors other than the Managing Director.”
The Court also held that Dr Yaru “is not authorised to commence proceedings on behalf of the other directors” and struck out his case accordingly.
Prime Minister Marape commended the Court’s decision.
“I commend the Court for its clear and decisive ruling. Let this be a reminder to all of us — in leadership, business, and the community — that we must follow the law at all times. No one is above it,” the Prime Minister said.
The ruling follows the Government’s appointment in July 2025 of Mr Gerea Aopi as the new Chairman of KPHL, a decision that Dr Yaru challenged in court. With the matter now resolved, the Prime Minister said the newly appointed Board can focus on its work.
“The new Board will get to work immediately to ensure our petroleum assets are managed with integrity, transparency, and in the best interests of all Papua New Guineans,” he said."

Addressing SARV through workshops,14/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5652,,Social,Trust,Nill,"The Melanesian Institute for Pastoral & Economic Services, based in Goroka has been a major driver of campaign against Sorcery Accusation Related Violence mostly in the Highlands region in Papua New Guinea for several years.
It is using community forums, educational campaigns, and workshops to equip youths and community members with the tools for evidence-based thinking, challenging unverified beliefs.
The institute in partnership with law enforcement agencies, educational institutions, religious organizations, and local leaders is now leading a new initiative in addressing deeply ingrained beliefs about sorcery that have led to violence, particularly against women, in Papua New Guinea.
The initiative seeks to create a more informed and resilient society. Accusations of sorcery, often based on superstition, have affected women, making them targets of violence and discrimination.
The Melanesian institute staff were in Yonki, Eastern Highlands province recently, following the conclusion of their initial series of workshops in the districts of Kainantu and Goroka from August 4 to 6, 2026.
The program aims to foster critical thinking and constructive dialogue throughout the Highlands region, to counter violence linked to these allegations and reinforcing human rights.
Religious leaders are also playing a vital role by promoting messages of compassion over fear to transform public perceptions.
The success of the program could serve as a model for other regions facing similar challenges."
NCD roads undergo maintenace in preparation for Independence,14/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5651,,Infrastructure,Anger,Powes Parkop,"There are road rehabilitation works currently going on in parts of Port Moresby, slowing down traffic in many parts of the city.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop confirmed that these road works are to fix roads that need maintenance in order for the city to be anniversary-ready come September.
Port Moresby motorists and residents were advised on 6th of August of the upcoming road maintenance works across the city.
The National Capital District Commission says these works are essential to ensure roads remain safe and operational for commuters. Roads under maintenance include major four-lane arterial roads like the Waigani Drive, Taurama Street, Boroko Drive, Hubert Murray Highway, Poreporena Freeway, and Sir John Guise Drive.
Works are being undertaken both during the day and night, along with temporary traffic disruptions as expected. Drivers have been urged to follow road signage, traffic management setups, and respect construction zones.
However, residents have voiced concerns on social media about traffic delays, congestion, and lack of clear schedules for the works.
Commuters have specifically raised frustration over the Koura Way to Freeway tunnel closure, and some have suggested roadworks be undertaken during off-peak hours or weekends.
Others highlighted safety concerns regarding PMV buses on footpaths and questioned the coordination of multiple simultaneous road projects across the city.
NCDC has apologised for any inconvenience caused and assures the public of its commitment to safe and efficient road infrastructure."
K214 billion expanded over 12 years without M&E,14/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5644,,Government,Anger,"James Marape, Michael Somare","A massive K214. 5 billion kina has passed through the government budgets over the last 12 years without any proper mechanism to monitor and evaluate the use of these funds.
Prime Minister James Marape pointed this out during the launch of the National Monitoring and Coordination Authority (NMCA) last night, reinforcing the importance of having this new agency in place to monitor and scrutinize the use of government funds.
With the nation at the threshold of its 50th Independence Anniversary, Prime Minister James Marape raised concerns of how huge budgets have been passed in the last 12 years, but no data in the government records to justify this spending.
“From 2013 to 2018, our total six-year budget under the past government was K83.5 billion. 2019 to 2024, the last six years under the PANGU administration, the collective six years, we have spent around almost K131 billion kina.
“All in all, the last 12 years, K214.5 billion has passed through previous treasurers and current treasurers and under our last two prime ministers.
“I speak from this background of executive government, not knowing exactly what has happened. Statistics are weak and the results that we have delivered is not clearly evident, number one. Number two, the requirement of our public finance reporting is really, really poor and not up to standard. And so every agency in the state that receives money must report back,” Marape said.
While comparing budget in the past, he said allocations in the last six years have been big but despite these allocations, countless strategies and plans, results are not visible.
“The question we ask ourselves is what have we done with these amount of resources? Over the past months, I have made it clear that the government can no longer afford the cost of weak coordination, delayed delivery, or worse, but more importantly, poor accountability. As we review all our systems, the story remains the same since 1975. Good at producing plans and strategies, we allocate budgets, but results often fall short of our commitments to our people,” he added.
With his term to last until 2027, making him the second longest serving Prime Minister after Sir Michael Somare, he does not want to repeat the same mistake – instead his cabinet has created the National Monitoring and Coordination Authority to ensure the good use of government funds in the years going forward.
“That is why we are not reinventing the wheel. There used to be national monitoring authority before.
“We are still monitoring parts of our nation's economy, not just writing checks for the planning department. In fact, the planning department should not be writing checks. But we have been consumed with writing checks, receiving checks, and spending. No one is really interested about monitoring what is happening amongst us. That has been the biggest deficiency we've carried thus far.
“And for me, speaking as your number one servant, by May 30th, 2027, I will be the second-longest serving prime minister, second only to Somare. Somare would have served nine years. I would have served eight years. And so it is guilt written over me.
“And to all of us, if we do not know what is happening to the public funds that has passed through our care, then NMCA comes in to fill in these gaps that remain amidst us.
“Budgets must align to plans. Plans must be implemented as approved. Loose ends must be closed so that every program is delivering on expected outcomes.”
“ If there is any government who will come after me, it is our duty as watchmen of our people's resources to account for every spend that we've spent,” the Prime Minister stressed.
One of his government’s agenda has been to grow the economy, and he says he does not want this effort to be wasted through corrupt practices, hence NMCA is vital to monitor and scrutinize government projects.
“I will create a section under my department - Department of Prime Minister, working with the NMCA, deploying and utilizing independent audit firms out there, independent engineering firms out there, independent accounting firms, and of course, not being government checking government.
“Government will not check government. And so NMCA is not going to check your government agencies. Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Anderson & Young, or Snowy River Mountain, the engineering firm, they're going to engage the private sector.
“Come and follow the money trail and check what is happening out there,”"
Former KPHL board chair’s application rejected,14/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5641,,Politics,Disgust,James Marape,"The Waigani National Court struck out a summons application filed by former Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited board chairman Dr Benedict Yaru, challenging Prime Minister James Marape’s appointment of new board chairman Gerea Aopi.
Justice Pauline Bre struck out the summons for being defective in not obtaining leave before filing the application, pursuant to Order 8 rule 50 of the National Court rules.
Order 8, rule 50 provides for leave to be obtained first before amending any document.
Lawyer representing Marape Dane Mel, submitted that the jurisdictional basis of amending the originating summons requires leave to be obtained before filing the amended originating summons. He submitted that no leave was obtained, and the amended originating summons was not properly before the court.
Dr Yaru counsel, Jonathan Holingu, in response, referred the Court to the background of the proceeding and clarified that this proceeding was filed as an urgent response to a media release by Marape the day before July 20, 2025, which announced the appointment of a new board chairman, Mr Aopi.
Holingu further argued that KPHL should be treated as a commercial entity and that Dr Yaru was still a director under the KPHL Act pursuant to section 108. Section 108 refers to occupying the position of a director.
“Dr Yaru’s term as a director of KPHL expired on September 3, 2023. He has no legal standing to challenge the Prime Minister's decision as the Trustee to appointing Aopi on June 10 and KPHL directors on June 26, 2025.”
“I therefore exercise my discretion pursuant to Order 10 rule 9A (15) (1) (a) and (2) (e) of the National Court Rules to summarily dismiss the proceedings for being incompetent for lacking standing and representational capacity,” Bre said.
The orders are,
1. The summons filed on 25 July 2025 is struck out for being defective in not obtaining leave before filing it, pursuant to Order 8 rule 50 of the National Court Rules.
2. The entire proceeding is summarily disposed pursuant to Order 10 Rule 9A(15)(1)(a) and (2) (e) of the National Court Rules as the plaintiff, Dr Bendict Yaru, does not have locus standi to bring the current action and the proceeding is not a duly constituted representative action.
3. Costs are awarded to the defendant to be paid by the plaintiff on a party/party basis.
4. Time for entry of these orders is abridged to the date of settlement by the Registrar of the National Court which shall take place, forthwith.
5. An administrative order is issued for the Registrar to close and archive the Court File as soon as practicable."

Importantly, under this plan we will continue to prioritize gender equality, disability and social inclusivity in the development and delivery of transport programs so that all Papua New Guineans get ultimate benefit from our transport planning.” Solan Mirisim said.
Secretary for Transport Mathew Wowoni admitted the geographical challenges of PNG which include high mountainous regions, low mangrove and swampy plains and major river systems, posing significant land transport connectivity issues, however said there is hope in this MTTP3.
“What makes this launch more meaningful is that the new MTTP3 is not the beginning, it is a continuation of a real progress that is already underway through transport sub-sectors across the country.
“Transformative work is happening on roads under the connect PNG program, sea transport under the national shipping services program with the Department of Transport, and the rehabilitation of ports under the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility of Pacific or AIFFP through the PNG Ports Corporation Limited,” Secretary Wowoni said.
Australian Minister Counsellor, Economic, Health & Infrastructure, Dr. Cate Rogers, representing the Australian government, acknowledged that working together can accomplish vibrant and resilient transport infrastructures.
“As Papua New Guinea prepares to celebrate its 50 years next month, it is a fitting moment to reflect on the progress we made together in transport infrastructure. From the construction and rehabilitation of national priority roads and strategic bridges, to the expansion of port infrastructure through the Australia Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific, our partnership as you would agree will be intact as we work side by side, step by step, we show that working together can accomplish vibrant and resilient transport infrastructure.” Said Minister Counselor, Dr. Rogers.
Minister Mirisim concluded that the MTTP3 has a role in connecting the nation through projects such as connect PNG and other interventions contained in the MTDP3 which are crucial for facilitating the economic activities and improving mobility and access to services."

PNGUoT Students to Face Administrative and Legal Action,13/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5634,,Education,Anger,Nill,"The students from PNG University of Technology (PNGUoT) who were identified in the harassment incident on Saturday will be dealt with both administratively and legally.
The university’s senior executive management hosted a press conference this afternoon in Lae, where they emphasised that the two processes will run simultaneously.
The harassment of the young woman on Saturday night has brought disrepute to an institution that has been working hard to raise its standards in both curriculum and infrastructure.
Pro vice chancellor – administration, Prof Kaul Gena, detailed that the management held a number of meetings with students to address the August 9th incident. The first one was on the night of Monday, August 11th, with female students.
“On Monday night, the management team went and had a conversation with them and gave the assurance that we are not going to sit here and allow very few students to derail and destroy the reputation of the university,” he stated.
“We gave the assurance to the female students that anybody who is seen to be violating or breaking any student rule will be disciplined.
“We had a forum with both male and female students at Duncanson Hall today. The management team spoke to them that what happened on Saturday night was unacceptable and the council and management strongly condemn that behaviour and we appealed to both male and female students that we have to work together to address the damage that has been caused by a very few students.
“We have a student population of just over 3,300 on campus and because we had a debate and religious program going on at the same time, the small incident attracted a mob.
“The students have come on board to help management identify those who had physically and verbally harassed the innocent woman. Their names are before the police. We have submitted a report so the police and police CID are doing their own investigation to identify and charge them.”
Prof Gena said today, two students were called into the security office, where it is believed that they were arrested and will have to follow due process to get themselves cleared.
Investigation is ongoing, with the management team clarifying that the five initial students who were identified will face the criminal process as well as the university’s internal student disciplinary process. Both processes will run in parallel.
Vice Chancellor, Prof Ora Renagi, emphasised that the university is now working on damage control and crisis management.
“We are very focused on our vision; we will continue to be a world-class university but we have challenges, like this issue,” Prof Renagi told Lae media.
“We will make sure that while justice is served, we have to make progress in rebuilding our reputation.
“The incident has been reported on social media and has reached our international stakeholders, and we are aware of the effect that it will have on our bilateral and multilateral partners and universities overseas.
“The world over is always focused on ensuring that the human values are upheld everywhere, including the universities. Particularly for the universities, we should be at the forefront of demonstrating – from staff to students to community – that our human values are upheld. That the Sustainable Development Goals are addressed and we make progress to ensure that we have a better society to live in.”"

Incomplete Maprik District Hospital Queried,13/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5629,,Health,Anticipation,Elias Kapavore,"Health Minister, Elias Kapavore has promised to send a team to Maprik to assess the status of the Maprik District Hospital and provide a full report to him.
After almost a decade, the Maprik District hospital is yet to be completed and was the subject of discussion in parliament last week Friday.
Member for Maprik, Libert Kapris told parliament that initial work to construct the Maprik District Hospital began in 2016. The project was valued at K8.1 million at that time but to date, it remains incomplete.
MP Kapris in raising this concern said according to the documents, the cause of the delay in the completion of this vital infrastructure is because of outstanding payments to the contractor.
“This district hospital will serve a population of 8,000 plus - a population that is rapidly increasing each year due to the increase in economic activities in the region. It will also serve other neighboring districts within the Central Sepik region.
“The only health centre in Maprik is always congested and is not able to fully cater for the increasing population. This situation is seriously affecting many women and children and is very critical.
“Can the NDoH evaluate, review, and value the abandoned project if so, when? When can NDoH settle the contractor on the outstanding fees? When can we expect contractor to commence work?”
Minister for Health in response, confirmed that the project was supposed to be completed within 18months from initial work in 2016. As of today, it is 65% with only K55 in the project account.
“Yes, it’s a concern. About nine years now and the project is 65% complete. I will send a team from the department of Health especially the facilities grant team to revisit Maprik and look at the particular infrastructure and give a full report on what needs to be done. I am aware that there was a 10million-kina awarded to this particular project by the government last year. However, that funding was not released but this is an important project and I affirm that it will commence very soon.”"

""This is the first time these three agencies will work together from the same location. It enables much more effective inter-agency collaboration and improve effectiveness in the identification, tracing, and recovery of assets under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2022.""
Commissioner Manning highlighted that face-to-face collaboration enables faster decision-making so that matters can be prosecuted in court and assets seized before criminals can try and hide them.
""With the ARROW Group, we can plan the seizure of assets from initial investigation through to prosecution and avoid the delays and miscommunications that can come from working in different locations.
""Criminals who benefit from corruption, drugs, weapons, stolen goods and other illegal activities face the real prospect that they will lose their houses, vehicles and money in their bank accounts without warning.
""In the modern era of communications and surveillance, criminals are not able to hide the proceeds of their crimes as had been the case in the past and they are on notice.”
Manning said confiscating the assets and money of criminals has been effective in other countries and has widespread public support.
""Those officers working within the ARROW Group have been given clear directions. Hit criminals where it hurts, seize assets, freeze bank accounts and take the profit out of crime,"" Manning added."

ENB women candidates commended,12/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5610,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"The president of the Council of Women in East New Britain has commended the efforts of women candidates contesting the local level government and ward elections this year.
Beverly Dam, who is also the provincial women’s representative in the provincial government, said she is proud to see a good number of women putting their hands up, to run for both the LLG president and ward member seats.
The PNG Electoral Commission office in the province had received a total of 49 female candidates, including eight for the LLG president seats.
This is also the largest number of female candidates that have ever contested in the elections in the province; both in the national and LLG elections.
Gazelle, being the largest district by population in the province, registered the highest number with 23 female candidates, including five contesting four of the eight LLG president seats in the district.
The two smaller districts of Kokopo and Rabaul recorded three and 19, respectively. Both districts also have a mayor’s seat each for Kokopo City and Rabaul town.
Kokopo district has three women contesting for ward member seats in only one of its four LLGs, while there are 18 candidates vying for ward member seats in all four LLGs of Rabaul district.
Rabaul district also registered a sole female candidate in the LLG president seat.
Having the largest landmass in the province, Pomio district only recorded two candidates each for the ward member seats in two wards and one of the seven LLG president seats.
Mrs. Dam said that often women can lead, but they tend to lack knowledge and information on what they are required to do in those important government offices.
“Most of them lack information on how they can lead their wards and LLGs. So, in the last two-and-a-half years, as we were going about, sorting out issues surrounding the Provincial Council of Women, we advocated on how women can participate in this male-dominated field of the elections.
“We also did some training on the government system, its structures and the processes of how the government runs its business.
“And as per the feedback we got from the participants, the lack of such vital information had created a barrier for more women to take part in the elections over the years.”
She said a lot of the women in the province are already in leadership roles in the various sectors of society, except in the political space.
Mrs Dam further iterated that being the only female representative in the provincial government posed a big challenge to her, in that it indicated the need for more women's voices at that political or decision-making level.
As a way forward, she urged more women to take up leadership roles in the political arena, beginning at the community and ward level.
With the re-establishment of the ENB Council of Women, Mrs Dam assured that more assistance would be given to women leaders in the province."

Recent detections of the virus in Lae City, 31 sewage samples, and three healthy children highlight the urgency.
“This campaign is about one thing and one thing only: reaching every single child, no matter where they live,” Dr Mendonca said, noting UNICEF’s provision of vaccines, cold chain equipment, and community engagement support.
Dr Mendonca commended the government’s swift action, saying, “Polio can take away a child’s future in an instant — but we can stop it.”

It has been a week since the August 4th ethnic confrontation that led to the death of four individuals – one of whom was a student – in Lae city.
Lae MP and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, took the time to visit the Kabwum community at Lae’s Kapiak Street, along Boundary Road, on Saturday, August 9th.
Rosso commended members of the Kabwum community for pledging not to escalate tensions and to support police investigations, despite the deaths and number of injuries sustained by their people.
“We live in a town and city, and I commend you all for abiding by the rule of law,” said Rosso. “I’m happy that you all listened to your leaders to let the law deal with this.
“I don’t know who is right or wrong. I’m a politician. The right person to deal with this is sitting here with his police investigators and forensics team, who will find out who is in the wrong.
“And whoever that is found to be in the wrong, I want to assure you all that they will face the full penalty of the law,” stated the MP.
“We live in a city, not in an uncivilised area where this rubbish attitude is tolerated.”

"Madang Governor Blasts ""Madness"" of Ramu Agri Taxes",10/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5596,,Politics,Anger,Ramsey Pariwa,"Madang Governor Ramsey Pariwa, has described the handling of Ramu Agri Industries taxes as “total madness” during Friday’s parliament sitting, after following up on the issue and the Ramu Nico mine lease.
According to Pariwa, Ramu Agri Industries is located in Madang Province, yet its taxes are paid to Morobe Province.
“What type of madness is this? What type of tax regime are we holding in this country, where the owner of the land is not receiving the tax, but another province is receiving it? Prime Minister, may you sort this issue with the tax and make sure the land owners receive the tax. This is daylight robbery,” Pariwa said.
In a second question, the Governor asked the Prime Minister if Madang could be included in the appointed state negotiation team to have a say in the extension of the Ramu Nico Mine lease.
Responding on behalf of the Treasurer, the Prime Minister referenced the Porgera Mine case, saying the government previously earned only 5% from Porgera under past agreements.
“I want to be clear, my record on Porgera is a testimony to what this government is resolving. In Porgera Mine the government was earning 5% which was the SML agreement. This government made correction and was made when the lease expired. I am not happy with the Ramu Nico agreement or Lihir Mining agreement, but we made agreements,” Marape Said.
He revealed there is a proposal to expand the Ramu Nico project through downstream processing elements, which would involve varying the project agreement to increase its scope.
“I want to assure the Governor for Madang, when we sit at the review table, then the people of Madang through the governor’s office will contribute their views into better benefit sharing agreement.”
Marape assured that as part of the government’s 50th anniversary reset, provinces hosting resource projects will see more equitable benefit-sharing and legal readjustments."
KPHL supports STEM program,10/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5595,,Education,Trust,James Marape,"The Department of Education signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) on Thursday, July 31, 2025, to support the STEM Program.
Secretary for Education, Dr. Uke Kombra, expressed immense gratitude to KPHL for the ""unique milestone"" partnership in supporting this vital program that will see 30 students sponsored to study in South Dakota State University, North Dakota State University, and the University of North Dakota in the United States.
The STEM Program, launched in 2020 with its first cohort beginning their studies in the six National Schools of Excellence in 2021, aims to send the top 5 percent of the best-performing students overseas to gain skills in areas that will help grow Papua New Guinea’s economy and drive innovation.
""We have basically been consuming the knowledge and research and all the skills are being created in overseas countries,"" Dr. Kombra stated, emphasizing the need for PNG to nurture its own intellectual capital.
The Secretary stated that currently, 208 Papua New Guinean students are studying overseas through the program, with 107 in the United States, 50 in China, 30 in India, and five in Fiji. In the US, students are enrolled in three universities – Nichols, North, and South Dakota – studying courses in petroleum, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medical fields that are very relevant for PNG’s future development.
Dr. Kombra highlighted that the program is a long-standing vision of the government, with Prime Minister James Marape having initiated the policy during his tenure as Minister for Education.
KPHL's commitment, Dr. Kombra noted, is a ""very visionary step"" and an investment that ""will bring value to our country."" The partnership between the Department of Education and KPHL is set for the next five years.
Looking ahead, the program plans to send a smaller number of students to Malaysia to study petrochemical and medicine, with other possibilities being explored carefully to ensure proper management.
Dr. Kombra also called on other corporate organisations, both private and public, to join KPHL in supporting this national cause. ""We are basically creating the capital for your own organization that you need for the next century,"" he urged, emphasizing the long-term benefits for the nation's industries.
Students participating in the program were encouraged to seize this ""very peculiar, very special opportunity"" and strive for excellence. Dr. Kombra challenged them to ""do something that’s different and not to come back as just a general engineer or a doctor,"" urging them to innovate and contribute significantly to PNG's knowledge-based economy.
He also called on them to be good ambassadors for PNG and abide by the rules and regulations of the institutions they are studying in and the communities they are living in or risk having their sponsorship terminated.
Meanwhile, KPHL Managing Director, Mr. Wapu Sonk said, “This is an example of how, as the national petroleum and energy company is actively transferring the wealth generated from development of our natural resources to improving human capital and social development in our country.”
Mr. Sonk added that KPHL’s five-year support for the STEM Scholarship Program will cost K150 million and reflects the company’s long-term commitment to human capital development in support of the Marape/Rosso government policy. By investing in the next generation of scientists and engineers, we are investing in the future of our country.”"

Call for Bicameral System,9/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5587,,Politics,Anticipation,"Powes Parkop, Puka Temu","Members of Parliament commemorated the 41st anniversary of the National Parliament House yesterday. During parliament recommendations were made for a bicameral system in the house of parliament, however, foundations need to be set for such changes in the next 50 years.
According to the United Kingdom Parliament, a bicameral system in parliament means that the legislature is divided into two separate houses or chamber. This is typically called the Upper House and the Lower House and is practiced in the USA, the UK, Australia, Canada and Italy.
“50 years this year I think we will now have to relook at how the unicameral system in the peoples house served us. I believe the 3 arms of government influenced the legislature, I think this calls for hard research,” said Member for Abau, Puka Temu.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop agreed.
“We need a bicameral system, the proposal to have governors in the upper house is a good proposal because it brings challenge on each other. A lot of times government since I came, we support the government blindly,” said the Governor for NCD.
Advantages of a bicameral system is checks and balances to avoid dominance, prevent poorly considered chambers, better representation, thorough debate and review, and the division of responsibility in the parliament.
Member for Ialibu-Pangia, Peter O’Neill, added that change can come about with a restructure like the bicameral system, however foundations need to be set in parliament for such changes in the next 50 years.
O’Neill said, “As we move on to the next 50 years, we need to set the foundation this term over the next two years it will shape our future. Whether we have an upper house or lower house we have to separate the executive government from parliament, were parliament can hold executive government to account.”
“For a small country like PNG, we have too many ministers. It works for us politics but not for the nation. We must not be afraid to make these changes. Why I say this, is because we won’t be here forever,” he added."

The hospital also reported the successful recovery of the first two recipients of kidney transplant in Papua New Guinea.
The first transplant involved a 58-year-old woman from Enga Province, who had been on dialysis since her diagnosis in 2022. Her 24-year-old niece selflessly volunteered as a living donor.
Both patients began passing urine within 24 hours post-surgery, a promising sign of transplant success. They and their donors remain under close observation by PMGH’s dedicated transplant team.

“Their recovery has been steady, and this achievement marks a national breakthrough in medical care. ”The significance of this milestone was underscored by Prime Minister James Marape, who visited the operating theatre during the second surgery and met with the first donor and recipient. He commended their courage and the role they played in making medical history for Papua New Guinea.
The surgeries were led by PNG’s own urologists and trained transplant surgeons, Dr. Damien Hasola, Dr. Sidney James, and Dr. Chris Munguas, alongside transplant specialists from TLC, Dr. Benjamin Lindsey and Dr. Jonathan Ellis.
The success was made possible through the unified efforts of PMGH’s multidisciplinary team, including anesthesiologists, nurses, doctors, pathologists, radiologists, and support staff.
Dr. Hoxson Okti Poki, Chairman of the Kidney Transplant Program Steering Committee (KTPSC), stated: “This groundbreaking procedure, positions Papua New Guinea as the first Pacific Island nation to successfully undertake an organ transplant. It reaffirms the Marape Government’s commitment to delivering world-class specialist health services domestically.”

Sir Michael’s work spoke volumes: Arthur Somare,8/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5581,,Politics,Trust,Michael Somare,"Arthur Somare, son of Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare described his father as a quiet and humble man, who was not boastful but let examples of his work speak volumes.
Speaking at the unveiling of Sir Michael’s monument yesterday evening, Mr Somare said Sir Michael carried a quiet confidence that came from being deeply grounded in the values of respect, dialogue, and Christian faith.
“Tonight, we unveil more than a statue—we unveil a symbol. A symbol of dignity, humility, courage, and unity. We immortalise in bronze not just the founding father of our nation, but the very embodiment of what it means to lead with honour, compassion, and vision.”
Mr Somare further said his father was not perfect, but was constant in his love for this country.
“And for that, we honour him – not as a distant historical figure, but as a leader whose shadow still falls upon this place, and whose spirit continues to whisper to our national conscience,” he said.
Mr Somare reminded leaders who attended the event that Sir Michael always reminded us that independence is not just about political freedom, rights, and liberties—it is the enduring hope for economic sovereignty and the right to stand on our own two feet as a nation.
“My father, the Grand Chief, often reminded us that political independence is meaningless unless it translates into the tangible improvement of the lives of ordinary citizens.
“He believed that no constitution, no law, and no political milestone could carry meaning unless it helped to uplift the lives and living conditions of the people—especially those who had been forgotten or left behind.
“He believed that leadership is not about power. It is not about status. It is, above all else, about service. And it must be rooted in humility, integrity, and an unwavering belief in fairness and justice.
“That is the legacy we are called to live up to,” he said.
Mr Somare called on all Papua New Guineans to see beyond their tribes and provinces, and embrace the idea that what unites them as Papua New Guineans is far greater than what divides them.
“That was Sir Michael’s vision. And that is what this statue must remind us of every single day.”"

Speaking during an official ceremony held in front of Parliament House in Port Moresby yesterday evening, Marape said the bronze monument was not merely a physical structure, but a national symbol representing unity, humility, service, and the enduring spirit of self-determination.
The statue, produced and cast in Indonesia, was the result of extensive collaboration between Indonesian artisans and the PNG government.
The prime minister said the monument stands as a symbol not only of Sir Michael’s contributions but also of the enduring relationship between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia — neighbours with a shared border, shared history, and growing bilateral partnership.
He added that the monument should serve as a civic space and a national beacon to inspire future generations.
“Today we do not just unveil a statue carved out of bronze,” Prime Minister Marape told the gathering. “We enshrine the memory of a man whose life carved into destiny our nation.
“The monument, which now stands facing the National Parliament, honours the life and leadership of Grand Chief Sir Michael Thomas Somare, the country’s first Prime Minister and founding father.”
The Prime Minister further stated that Sir Michael was not only a political leader, but a unifying figure whose leadership turned a complex, fragmented colony into a single, sovereign nation.
“Sir Michael was a bridge between time and tradition.
“He connected a country of one thousand tribes and cultures into one national identity — one people, one country, one nation.”
“He bridged our colonial past with an independent future, not through upheaval, but through deliberate dialogue and patient diplomacy,” Prime Minister said.
He said Sir Michael’s approach to independence was marked not by violence, but by dialogue, diplomacy, and faith in the people of Papua New Guinea.
The prime minister also used the occasion to remind elected officials, public servants, and all citizens of their responsibility to uphold the values for which Sir Michael stood.
“This is a reminder of the duty we have for the construction of our country,” he said.
“Let us never allow the foundations he laid to be eroded by greed, disunity, complacency, or corruption.”
He called for continued unity across political and regional divides and encouraged a renewed spirit of nationhood as Papua New Guinea approaches its 50th Independence Anniversary.
“This is not just a day of remembrance,” he said.
“It is a day of recommitment to the ideals of humility, unity in diversity, and service above self.”"
U.S. Aids UXO Cleanup,8/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5575,,International,Trust,Nill,"The United States Government is ramping up support to Papua New Guinea in clearing explosive remnants of war (ERW), investing in both training and clearance operations to protect lives and restore land for safe community use.
A five-week Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) training program—concluded on July 25—was delivered by U.S. Marines from the 1st Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Company of the I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF). Held in Port Moresby and various locations across PNG, the training focused on enhancing the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF)’s ability to safely identify, handle, and destroy unexploded ordnance (UXO) and other remnants of war.
""The United States is proud to support Humanitarian Mine Action efforts in Papua New Guinea,” said Col. Baskins, senior defense official and Defense Attaché with the U.S. Embassy Port Moresby. “These programs reflect our commitment to a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific, and strengthens the partnership between our two nations.""
Participants were trained in ordnance identification, safe handling procedures, controlled demolitions, and emergency responses. “It has been a great experience working alongside the PNGDF. Their dedication is inspiring,” said Staff Sergeant Mueller, EOD Team Leader from the 7th Engineer Support Battalion.
In a separate but complementary initiative, the U.S. Government has committed a USD $2.25 million (PGK 9.2 million) grant to the HALO Trust to expand UXO remediation activities in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville and Oro Province. The grant will fund survey and mapping operations, national UXO tracking, community risk education, and the excavation of hazardous areas.
The HALO Trust signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with Bougainville authorities in June and is expected to finalize a similar agreement with Oro Province soon. Their operations aim to reduce the risk of injury or death caused by decades-old munitions left over from World War II.
The U.S. first provided UXO assistance to PNG in 2009, when its Quick Reaction Force destroyed 2,727 UXO items and small arms ammunition in Torokina, Bougainville. These sustained efforts underscore the U.S.’s long-term commitment to supporting PNG’s development and regional security goals."

These security forces are tasked with safeguarding the counting centre, maintaining peace, and preventing any disruptions during this critical phase.
All contending candidates have assured their supporters will remain within designated perimeters and will manage their own security arrangements. Their cooperation is vital to maintaining a peaceful environment and upholding the integrity of the process.
“As the Provincial Police Commander of Madang, I sincerely appreciate the assurances from all candidates to maintain peace and security during this period. I also commend polling officials, the Provincial Administrator Daniel Aloi and all stakeholders for their support and dedication, enabling the successful completion of polling despite minor operational challenges,” Baim stated.
“I call on everyone involved to uphold this spirit of cooperation and peace during the counting phase. It is our collective responsibility to ensure a credible and transparent process, leading to a legitimate outcome that will be determined by the counts in the coming days,” stressed the PPC.
On Day 3, the situation on ground remains stable with no major incidences."

The Parliament House, opened on August 7, 1984 by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, now His Majesty King Charles III, was built not only as a place for decision-making—but as a house for all the people of Papua New Guinea.
It stands at the heart of the nation—a place where leaders, elected by the people, come together to debate, legislate, and shape the future of this country.
The National Parliament House has been more than just a seat of government—it has been the stage upon which PNG’s young democracy has grown over four decades,.

-	The peaceful transition of governments,
-	The passing of laws that define  the country’s progress,

Duma explains sale of MVIL shares in BSP,7/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5555,,Politics,Trust,"Solen Loifa, William Duma","Minister for State Enterprises, William Duma was yesterday (Wednesday, 06 August 2025) asked to explain why Motor Vehicle Insurance Limited shares in BSP were sold. Social media speculations prompted the Member for Menyamya, Solen Loifa to raise this in parliament during question time.
Minister Duma’s response included assuring the government and the people that the money would be put to good use.
Duma was asked why these shares were sold when BSP was doing well. Minister Duma in defending the sale said it was done transparently, was competitive and compliant with relevant laws, including the Kumul Consolidated Holdings Act.
He then said MVIL and KCH have held significant shareholdings in BSP for many years and it was the right time to evolve this ownership.
“The government doesn’t own any shares in BSP, those shares were held by MVIL a completely different company so we need to get that correct.”
“You can be a shareholder in a company but that does not necessarily mean you hold those shares forever. As an investor there comes a time where you can make a decision to sell those shares at a good price, when the shares are performing well you sell out and make the money. That was a commercial decision made by both boards of KCH and MVIL and finally approved by cabinet.”
Duma said shares were purchased by over 50 different PNG investors, made up of PNG companies and individuals through JMP Securities Ltd as one of the country’s two licensed stockbrokers. He said priority was given to domestic investors.
“There needed to be a sell down to help Kumul Consolidated Holdings fund projects worth a billion-kina like the aging infrastructure of PNG Power right throughout the country. We don’t want to ask the government for funding again and that is why we made that decision.”
Four key objectives of sale were outlined in the statement including Fiscal Consolidations, Portfolio rebalancing, market development and focus on core functions."

New Ireland Provincial Member Walter D Schnaubelt announced this during the New Ireland Day celebrations held at the Kavieng Stadium last Saturday, August 02, 2025.

Honouring the Flag’s Forgotten Designer,6/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5545,,Culture,Anticipation,Nill,"As Papua New Guinea prepares to celebrate its 50th Independence Anniversary on September 16th, a call for long-overdue recognition has emerged — one deeply rooted in the nation’s identity.
The family of the late Susan Karike, designer of the PNG national flag, is appealing to the government and the people to finally acknowledge the life and legacy of the woman behind one of the country’s most powerful symbols.
Susan Karike was only 15 years old when she designed the flag that would go on to represent a proud, independent Papua New Guinea. Her work has been flown high above government buildings, schools, and homes for half a century now, yet her contribution remains one of the least recognised.
“Susan Karike, as a young girl, designed the flag that has represented our country for half a century. It's a symbol that unites us, from the mountains to the islands. Yet, for so long, her incredible contribution went without the proper recognition it deserved.
It was a tragic reality that she never received the national acknowledgement she was due in her lifetime,” her family said in a heartfelt statement.
As the country prepares for its Golden Jubilee, her family sees this historic milestone as the perfect opportunity to honour her legacy in a formal and national way.
“As we approach this Golden Jubilee, this 50-year milestone, we, the people of the Late Susan Karike, feel it is the perfect time to rectify this. We believe that this anniversary isn't just about celebrating the past, but also about honoring the people who built it. Susan Karike's story is a foundational part of that history,” they said.
The family is calling for her story to be written into national history books and taught across schools in Papua New Guinea, so that her name and contribution are passed on to generations to come.
“Our greatest wish, our deepest hope, is that her work and her contributions can finally be written down in the history books of Papua New Guinea. We want her story to be taught in schools. We want this generation, and all the generations that follow, to know who designed the flag they salute every day. It's a matter of national pride and historical accuracy.”
The push to honour Susan Karike comes not just from a place of family pride, but from a desire to preserve national memory and celebrate unsung heroes.
“Remembering Susan Karike's legacy is not just about our family; it's about all of us as Papua New Guineans. It's about ensuring that the stories of our heroes, particularly our unsung heroes, are never forgotten. We believe that by honoring her, we honor the very spirit of our independence.”
As the nation prepares to raise its flag once again in celebration, there is a growing sense that this year, more than ever, is the time to also raise the story of the young woman who created it."

Porgera Infrastructure Damage Recognized as Terrorism by PNG Law,6/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5551,,Politics,Fear,Nill,"The destruction of public infrastructure and threats to key national roads in Porgera have now been officially branded as acts of terrorism by the Controller of the Porgera State of Emergency, Chief Superintendent, Joseph Tondop.
In a strongly worded statement issued yesterday, Tondop confirmed that the recent hijacking of ballot boxes and destruction of two bridges in Mulitaka during the by-election were serious criminal acts and are now under investigation.
The incident occurred on 18 July 2025, when armed supporters of some candidates in Mulitaka hijacked eight ballot boxes being transported for council ward elections. The ballot papers were reportedly tampered with and then returned to Paiam Police Station. In retaliation, supporters of rival candidates destroyed two bridges leading into Porgera.
“These are serious crimes. Two wrongs do not make a right,” Tondop said.
He confirmed that the matter was referred to the Electoral Commissioner, who, on 31 July 2025, ruled that the tampered boxes would be excluded from the counting process.
However, those who hijacked the boxes have rejected this decision and are now threatening to destroy the vital Wabag-Porgera bridge, a critical transport link for the Porgera Gold Mine and the broader economy.
“I take these threats very seriously and have already directed State Security Forces into Mulitaka to secure the bridge,” Tondop stated.
He stressed that any destruction or threat to destroy critical infrastructure constitutes terrorism under Papua New Guinea’s Counter Terrorism Act 2024, with bridges legally defined as critical infrastructure.
“ I will not tolerate any act that threatens innocent lives and the national economy,” he said.
Tondop has made three key recommendations to the Police Commissioner:
•	Declare Mulitaka and its surrounding areas a Prohibited Area;
•	 Declare individuals supporting the destruction of the bridge as members of a terrorist organisation;
•	Recognise all actions taken in Mulitaka as meeting the legal definition of terrorism.
Tondop called on all Mulitaka candidates to publicly direct their supporters to stand down and refrain from any criminal activity, warning that inaction could itself be a crime.
“Papua New Guinea is a country of laws. I have sworn to uphold these laws, and I will enforce them to their fullest extent,” Tondop added."
Court revokes K7000 bail granted to Ekip,6/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5546,,Crime,Anger,Nill,"The Waigani District Court today revoked a bail that was granted to suspect Benjamin Ekip, after he was released on a police bail of K7000 on Monday, 04 August 2025.
Ekip is alleged to have assaulted the Managing Director of Kana Construction, Roxon Undi at the Ela Beach Hotel on 26 July, 2025.
Police prosecutor, Tau Azariah, made a submission at the Waigani Committal Court today, asking the court to revoke a police bail of K7000 by the suspect, who is now out of custody.
Constable Tau in this submission cited the lack of proper bail process by Ekip. Given the seriousness of the charges, Ekip should have sought bail at the courts, and not a police bail.
Ekip did not appear in court to explain how he got out on bail without following the proper bail process.
Presiding Magistrate, Tracy Ganaii granted the application of Constable Tau and adjourned the matter for hearing tomorrow, where further directions will be issued.
Mr Ekip was charged with one count of actual physical possession of a firearm and one count of threatening to discharge a firearm.
The charges arise from a July 26, 2025 incident at the Ela Beach Hotel carpark, where Mr. Ekip allegedly pursued and attempted to shoot Undi, and his employee while armed and intoxicated. The victims took cover behind their vehicle before Black Swan security personnel intervened and disarmed the suspect.
Kana Construction condemned the act and urged for justice to prevail while expressing concern over the escalating misuse of firearms in public spaces."

NZ PM expresses desire to strengthen PNG-NZ relationship,5/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5531,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon in addressing the PNG Parliament this morning indicated his government’s commitment to strengthening the PNG - New Zealand relationship and their joint endeavours.
Luxon expressed these sentiments considering the long relationship PNG has with New Zealand and the strategic location of PNG in the wider Pacific.
“Regionally, Papua New Guinea accounts for over three-quarters of the Pacific Islands landmass and almost two-thirds of its people. But your size means, where you go, the Pacific goes. Where you succeed, the Pacific succeeds.”
He said PNG’s strategic position, connecting the Pacific to Asia, puts the country at the heart of the Indo-Pacific, playing a critical role for trade routes, and presenting opportunities to renew and deepen ancient ties.
He also said that same geographic position also means that in times of turbulence, including both World Wars and at no small cost, Papua New Guinea has acted as a barrier between conflict in the world and the rest of the region.
“Your country is, as you have pointed out to me, Prime Minister, both a buffer and a bridge between Asia and the Pacific.
“It therefore almost goes without saying, Honourable Members, that Papua New Guinea matters to New Zealand. And the Government I lead is committed to strengthening our friendship and joint endeavours with you.”
“Papua New Guinea is an ambitious nation whose spirit rises with the mist over the Highlands, whose determination flows with the mighty Sepik and Fly rivers, and whose potential is as high as Mt Wilhelm.""
He described PNG as a nation rich not only in natural beauty and resources, but in the resilience, creativity, and spirit of the people."
Lae school closes indefinitely,5/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5535,,Education,Sadness,Nill,"Markham Road Primary School has been closed indefinitely following the ethnic clash and killing at Kapiak St, in Lae, on Monday, August 4th.
Morobe’s provincial program adviser for education, Keith Tangui, expressed frustration that an incident that could have been settled in an amicable manner has spiralled out of control, directly affecting nearly 2,000 students.
“We have Markham Road as a junior high school and I do not wish to see that school face a problem like that,” he stated. “It’s an urban school.
“We cannot allow these barbaric activities to continue. We must put a stop.”
Tangui said classes will resume once the matter has been resolved and it is deemed safe for students to return, as Markham Road Primary is only a few metres from Kapiak St.
Lae police have reported that the incident stemmed from an altercation between groups from Morobe and Enga. Failure to amicably reach a resolution led to the killing of three men and a primary school student.
While police have apprehended a suspect, Tangui stressed on the need for leadership at the community level, which could have prevented the situation from escalating.
“A student has died and I should have been the first to know,” he continued. “Nobody has reported that.”"

Alcohol Industry Urged Support Responsible Drinking,5/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5530,,Health,Sadness,Nill,"The alcohol industry, comprising manufacturers, distributors, and licensed vendors have been urged to support responsible drinking campaign, as this can help reduce the influx of alcohol-related deaths in the city.
Minister for Police, Peter Tsiamalili Jnr made this call following the death of up to 10 people in different parts of the country.
“Over the past weekend alone, between the 46th, 45th, and 44th days to Independence, 10 people tragically lost their lives in alcohol-related incidents, mostly from vehicle accidents.”
This sharp rise in avoidable deaths has triggered immediate response from the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
“To ensure public safety during the lead-up to Independence Day, the Government has authorised the activation of more than 700 police reserve personnel to reinforce law and order across Port Moresby, alongside intensified deployments of regular officers.”
“We cannot stand by as our roads become killing grounds. Our celebrations must not be marred by senseless loss of life. Ten lives lost in just three days is unacceptable,” Tsiamalili said.
Tsiamalili who is also the Acting Minister for Information Communications and Technology further called on alcohol manufacturers, distributors, and licensed vendors to be part of the solution in reducing violence and deaths.
“As Acting Communications Minister, I am directing greater engagement between the department with business and media outlets to work together to deal with this pressing issue.”
“It is wrong for businesses to profit from alcohol sales while turning a blind eye to the destruction their products cause.
“Those involved in the liquor business must step up and join us in promoting responsible drinking. Some of these businesses are already active in supporting awareness campaigns, and this is appreciated, but others have to step up.”
“We expect the alcohol industry to fund and support campaigns, display responsible drinking warnings on products and advertisements, and engage in real community awareness.”
He said the 50th Independence Anniversary should be a time of pride, unity, and reflection—not mourning and funerals.
“Let us celebrate Independence with dignity and responsibility. Let these next 44 days set a national example of unity, not tragedy.”"
PM JAMES MARAPE REAFFIRMS UNITY AND REGIONAL EMPOWERMENT AT SIGNING OF 2025 PORT MORESBY PAPUA ACCO...,5/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5533,,Politics,Trust,"James Marape, Mekere Morauta, Rufina Peter","Prime Minister Hon. James Marape has reaffirmed his Government's
unwavering commitment to National Unity, Regional Empowerment, and Inclusive Development during the  historic Signing of the 2025 Port Moresby Papua Accord, held today at the State Function Room, Parliament House.
The Signing, which marks a significant milestone following the outcomes of the Papua Governors’ Dialogue, brought together key national and regional leaders from the Southern or Papuan Region of the country, ahead of Papua New Guinea’s 50th Independence anniversary celebrations next month.
In his address, Prime Minister Marape acknowledged the contributions of Papuan leaders, past and present, and emphasized that the strength of PNG lies in its diversity and unity.
“Fifty years on, our nation calls for greater unity than division,” PM Marape declared. “Diversity builds and not destroys. Diversity harnesses talents and mobilizes resources and human ingenuity for our country to prosper.”
He thanked Chairlady of the Parliamentary Governors' Council, and Central Governor Hon. Rufina Peter, and all Governors from the Papuan Region for their leadership and partnership in regional dialogue. “To all Parliament Governors, to all Members of Parliament from the Papuan region of our country, I thank you for
embracing this conversation of progress and unity,” he said.
Referencing the United States as an example of a nation built on diversity, the Prime Minister noted, “The greatest democracy and economy today was built not by language or tribe, but on the principle of human equality embedded in Christian values.”PM Marape acknowledged the foundational roles played by Papua in PNG’s journey to independence:
“Right from day one, the Papuan side has contributed to the country as much as the New Guinea side. If you count the divide of Papuan territory and New Guinea territory, Papua has had four Prime Ministers — Bill Skate, Mekere Morauta, Peter O’Neill and myself.”
He urged the country to look beyond artificial divides and recognize the deep ancestral and trade connections among the regions:
“We were a people before there was a Papua. We were a people before there was a New Guinea. Let us step away from the notion of a Papua–New Guinea divide.”
Marape also used the occasion to call for full utilization of existing legal powers by Provincial Governments under the Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-level Governments. “Since 1995, when has one Provincial Government utilized its powers? If it hasn't happened, where is the problem? Pangu Party borne Provincial Governments after Independence to unite the country, not divide our country.”
He committed his Government to further decentralization and empowerment of Provinces, referencing Sections 42 and 44 of the Organic Law which grant wide-ranging powers to Governors and LLGs in education, health, land, tourism, agriculture, and resource management. On development, PM Marape announced that over K1 billion worth of infrastructure and connectivity projects are being rolled out across the Southern region, including road links from Port Moresby to Alotau,
Kikori and Kerema, to unlock tourism, agriculture, and trade.
He also highlighted new Export opportunities: “For the first time, Total is doing deep sea exploration at Mailu (Abau district). China has approved our coffee and seafood exports. Abau district in Central Province is now sending crabs directly to Singapore.”
Closing his remarks with a call to action, the Prime Minister challenged public servants and leaders alike:
“Let us not be talkers — let us be workers. The power lies in our hands. If we unlock these structural impediments together, we can grow the economy and better serve our people.”
Prime Minister Marape concluded with a heartfelt appreciation to the Papuan people:
“Thank you, thank you, thank you. You have played your fair share and carried us. Let us continue to work together in unity. God bless.”"
KPHL receives developer license for industrial park,5/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5526,,Business,Trust,Nill,"The Special Economic Zones Authority (SEZA) Board has approved the issuance of a 12-month Provisional Developer Licence to Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) for the development of the Central Province Industrial Park (CPIP) at Caution Bay.
This comes following recommendations from the SEZA Licensing Committee. The SEZA Board Chairman, Dr. Lawrence Sause, and the KPHL Managing Director, Wapu Sonk, announced in a joint press conference held in Port Moresby on Monday, August 4.
The CPIP project is a cornerstone of the government's economic diversification agenda and is expected to stimulate job creation, industrial processing, and regional development in Central Province.
The project will involve joinery and fabrication, as well as upgrading skill set and developing the competency of PNG in steelworks fabrication and joinery.
The Board, in the interest of financial prudence and legal compliance, resolved that the tax or non-tax incentives under the SEZ incentive framework are deferred pending the provision and assessment of the following by the SEZA Board.
The Board emphasized that incentives will not apply retrospectively. Only costs and activities undertaken after full compliance will be eligible for exemption or relief.
According to Dr Sause, the investment value of this project is K1.85 million.
This is a significant investment by one of PNG’s own companies, KPHL. This initiative, through this investment, demonstrates that KPHL genuinely believes in this country.
""We welcome this milestone for the Central Province Industrial Park and commend KPHL for taking the lead. At the same time, the Board has a legal duty to ensure transparency and fiscal discipline. We will only grant incentives when minimum financial disclosures and compliance standards are satisfied. This is how we build investor confidence and public trust,” he said.
Dr Sause said KPHL will be notified of the licence terms and has a 12-month window to comply. The Licensing Committee will reassess the application once all conditions are met, which may lead to conversion to a Full Developer Licence or activation of incentives under the current Provisional Licence. This approach supports investor engagement while maintaining the integrity of the SEZ program.
Mr Sonk said the first phase of the project will involve the establishment of the training and fabrication facility to train Papua New Guineans with the skills needed for the mining and oil and gas sector.
“The training and fabrication facility will be used to invest in PNG’s younger generation to build the skill base needed to fabricate things from not only PNG but overseas as well. It is not only a specialized project for resource projects such as oil, gas, and mining but also for general constructions and industry, such as building ships, boats, and many different things,” he said.
Sonk said other facilities that will be built include a police post, a clinic, and other government facilities that will benefit both the government and the community as well. However, KPHL will now work with the SEZA board to obtain the 15-year license for these developments."
GG welcomes New Zealand PM,5/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5525,,Politics,Trust,Bob Dadae,"As part of his three-day visit to Papua New Guinea, Prime Minister of New Zealand Christopher Luxon paid a courtesy visit to PNG’s Governor General, Grand Chief Sir Bob Dadae, this morning at the Government House.
In his welcome remarks, Grand Chief Sir Bob acknowledged the close and historical relations both PNG and New Zealand share, and in particular, New Zealand’s direct funding assistance and volunteer service in rural communities in PNG.
Prime Minister Luxon stated that New Zealand is proud of its close relations with PNG that reach back to the arrival of the Maori missionaries in the 1800s, the participation of New Zealand soldiers in WWII in parts of PNG and New Zealand’s participation as one of eight countries invited to celebrate PNG’s Independence Day in 1975.
Prime Minister Luxon said New Zealand is pleased to provide development and trade assistance, as well as defence and security support to PNG, which it has been doing for many years.
The meeting concluded with the exchange of gifts between Sir Bob and PM Luxon."
Court dismisses review application on Dei by-election decision,5/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5521,,Law,Neutral,Steven Pim,"The Supreme Court on Thursday, July 31, dismissed the objection to the competency application filed by Westly Nukundj, which sought to review the National Court's decision ordering a by-election for the Dei Open electorate in 2024.
The application filed on February 11, 2025, challenged the election of the first respondent, late Steven Pim, who was elected as MP in the 2022 general election.
The applicant in these proceedings is Nukundj. The first respondent is late Pim, and the second respondent is the PNG Electoral Commission.
It was before the court that a trial was conducted. The trial judge, on July 22, 2023, reserved the decision. In September that same year, the first respondent died. The trial judge recalled the parties and received submissions on whether the National Court had jurisdiction to proceed to a decision on the petition. Finding that the National Court had jurisdiction, on February 23 2024, the trial judge delivered judgment and declared a by-election.
However, the applicant filed an objection to the competency application to review that decision because the National Court erred in part of the order. Nukundj claims that the court ought to have ordered a recount.
The applicant argues that the trial judge, after finding a serious error in the conduct of the election by the returning officer, unlawfully decided not to count the contents of two ballot boxes, and, finding that this error materially affected the result of the election, erred in not ordering a recount.
The second respondent, the Electoral Commission, submitted that the National Court has no jurisdiction due to the combined effects of section 104 (2) (g) and 106 of the Constitution. Section 104 (2) (g), states that the seat of a member of Parliament becomes vacant on his death. Section 106 states, if the office of an elected member of Parliament becomes vacant otherwise than by virtue of section 104 (2) (b) (normal term of office), an election shall be held to fill the vacancy unless the vacancy occurs;
(a) Within the period of 12 months before the fifth anniversary of the date fixed for the return of writs for the previous general election or,
(b) After the writ has been issued for an election under section 105 (1) (general elections) and before the day fixed for the return of that writ, writs for a general election are issued, the first-mentioned writ shall be deemed to have been revoked.
However, the Supreme Court, consisting of Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika, Justice David Cannings, Justice Collin Makail, and Justice Joseph Yagi, dismissed Nukundj’s review application because the Dei Open seat became vacant when the first respondent died on September 22, 2023. They stated that a by-election becomes necessary as a matter of law and that there are no exceptions to these constitutional requirements."

Sonk maintains innocence,5/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5528,,Business,Anger,Nill,"Managing Director of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) Wapu Sonk has expressed concerns about the absence of a formal legal avenue for him to challenge the media allegations made against him.
Despite corruption allegations labelled against him by the Australian media, there are no formal complaints being laid with relevant government agencies like police to look into this matter.
“I have not been afforded a formal legal avenue to respond to or challenge the claims made against me. This absence of due process is deeply concerning.”
Labelling the allegations as a smear campaign by the Australian media, aimed at destroying his reputation at the Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited, he urged the public not to make judgement on hearsay.
“We must resist media sensationalism and remain steadfast in upholding due process, institutional respect, and national respect. The international and domestic communities alike must see that PNG is a nation governed by law – not by media narratives.”
In the meantime, Sonk said he is still the Managing Director of the KPHL and will carry out his entrusted role at the organization.
“I will continue my operational mandate to execute KPHL’s corporate strategy as approves by the Board and National Executive Council (NEC) through annual operating plans, unless this is changes through competent process.”
Sonk is actively carrying out its responsibility as the Managing Director of the Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited and is also working to clear his name from the allegations labeled against him.

“To date, no concrete evidence has been produced nor any charges laid with respect to the claims,"" Sonk said.
""There are signed sub-contracts or officially sanctioned correspondence to support the allegations.”"
Officials trained ahead of counting,4/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5512,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"The Usino-Bundi by-election officials have undergone a one-day training facilitated by the Provincial Electoral Office ahead of counting this week.
The training is a refresher to ensure they are well informed to monitor counting officials during the actual counting scheduled to commence on Tuesday, 05th August.
The officials comprise the Returning Officer Terence Baiyo and the Assistant Returning Officers (AROs) of each Local Level Government.
Trainer Richard Kaiban, the Assistant Election Manager for East Sepik, emphasized the new approach of the count model of decentralized counting at a centralized count centre that they will be taking to ensure counting is effectively and efficiently coordinated for an improved outcome.
The training took the participants through the LPV voting system and the technical details of the counting processes, such as the:
•	Exclusion/Elimination
•	Formal and Informal ballot paper identifications
•	Exhausted ballot papers
•	Calculating the absolute majority
•	Allowed personnel within the counting venue
•	Quality checks and procedures
•	Appropriate forms utilized for counting and Quality checks
•	Filling forms correctly
Provincial Election Manager, Szponsa Navi said it is vital for the AROs to attend this training so as to gain the knowledge needed to train count officials for the LLG elections coming in September.
The nine participants were also given examples of counting scenarios and put into perspective situations that may arise as counting progresses. Scenarios that included Crisis Management protocols and the chain of command and channel of communication needed to follow if an error is encountered.
The Returning Officer for the Usino-Bundi by-election, Terence Baiyo, emphasized due diligence for the counting so that the Usino-Bundi people genuinely accept their newly appointed leader for the next several months until the next National General Elections in 2027.
In conclusion, Mr Kaiban reiterated the importance of counting and the documentation for an acceptable count and declaration in line with the Organic Law on National & LLG Election.
The new counting strategy is said to be cost-effective by limiting counting days from almost two weeks to a week or even a few days. The counting process will begin with separate LLG counts, quality checks, and later merging of data for elimination, and eventually a declaration."
ABG embraces forestry autonomy,4/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5511,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"The Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) is now prepared to make greater progress in forestry management and economic empowerment for its people, after signing a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with the PNG Forest Authority (PNGFA).
The signing took place in Port Moresby between PNGFA Managing Director John Mosoro and ABG Chief Secretary Kearnneth Nanei and was witnessed by senior officials from both parties on Friday, August 1, 2025.
Speaking after the signing, PNGFA Managing Director John Mosoro said the agreement in principle allows for a ""structured and meaningful step forward toward empowering Bougainville to sustainably manage its forest resources.
“Today's signing of the Memorandum of Agreement between PNGFA and ABG represents a significant step forward in supporting Bougainville's autonomy aspirations. It outlines a structured and practical approach to transferring selected forestry powers and responsibilities, under the Forestry Act 1991 (as amended), to the ABG from 2025 to 2030.
He said this initiative reflected a broader trend across government, where national departments and agencies have entered similar agreements with the ABG to gradually transfer functions.
“These partnerships have provided useful lessons and a national pathway to manage transition responsibly while maintaining national and sectoral integrity,” he said.
Mr Mosoro added that the MOA preserves national oversight while honouring Bougainville's autonomy.
“It sets up a formal platform for structured cooperation, enabling PNGFA to continue offering technical assistance, policy advice, and institutional support as Bougainville builds its internal capacity,” he explained.
The Chief Secretary of the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG), Kearneth Nanei, described the signing as “historic and significant,” marking a formal commitment to the transfer of key powers and functions to Bougainville under the ongoing autonomy arrangements.
Mr Nanei commended Mr Mosoro and his executive team for their leadership and support in progressing the transfer of forestry-related responsibilities to the region.
“We thank you for making your time available to meet with us,” Nanei said.
“On behalf of the President, the Autonomous Bougainville Government, and the people of Bougainville, we are grateful for this momentous occasion.”
The meeting marked a pivotal moment in the broader transfer of powers under the constitutional framework of Papua New Guinea, specifically the implementation of Schedules 1 and 2 of the Memorandum of Understanding between the national government and the ABG.
Nanei emphasized technical capacity, institutional arrangements, structured cooperation, and ongoing collaboration as the foundation of the successful implementation of Bougainville’s forestry powers.
“This partnership represents the first time a national agency has agreed to relinquish some of its powers to a sub-national government. It is not just symbolic—it empowers Bougainville to sustainably manage its forestry resources,” he said.
Reflecting on Bougainville’s past, Nanei noted hard-learned lessons from past resource extraction ventures and called for a more responsible and inclusive model of development going forward.
“We had a very bad experience in terms of resource development, and in terms of mining, in terms of the forestry sector, the experience that we've gone through has taught us a lot in terms of how resources are extracted and benefits are received,” he explained.
“The experience that we have gone through has taught the national government and the independent state of Papua New Guinea, and the rest of us lessons that we have to be delicate in dealing with resource owners, land owners, and other people in the community.
“So, with those lessons learned, we take this transfer of forestry powers and functions that's very significant and historic. So, this is a historic occasion, and we are privileged and honoured to be with you and your very senior management team witnessing this occasion.”
He reaffirmed ABG’s commitment to agreeing and called on the PNGFA to help Bougainville develop the necessary human resources and institutional frameworks to manage its forestry sector.
“This joint partnership, cooperation that we are building together, will be the part in terms of empowering Bougainvilleans, the ABG, to build up their capacity in terms of manpower, but also the regulatory institution that is going to be required to effectively manage and administer the forestry powers and functions in the autonomous region of Bougainville,” added Mr Nanei.”"
Kido village a new game changer to PNG,4/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5513,,Business,Anticipation,James Marape,"The villagers of Kido village, Hiri Koiari District, will now see development in their area after a decade of dialogues involving developers, landowner groups, the government, and state agencies.
The Pacific Lime and Cement project was launched on Friday, August 1, at Kido village by Prime Minister James Marape.
This launch, known as the country’s first downstream lime-manufacturing hub, is capable of producing quicklime, clinker, and ultimately cement from quarry to port. This could potentially establish a new export industry as well.
Kido Landowner Association Chairman said, “For us, the landowners, it represents opportunity, partnership and the beginning of lasting change for our community.
“We are committing to protect the community’s legacy, ensuring that the benefits of the project uplift the children, provide education, healthcare, roads and livelihoods while respecting the village’s environment and traditions.”
PLC Managing Director, Paul Mulder emphasized that this project is a generational change for the people of Kido and Lealea villages, Hiri-Koiari District, Central Province, and the country.
“This is 400million tonnes plus of materials that are here to build the country, to prioritize building the country first before we export abroad.
“I’m so privileged that we will see bricks, pavers, casting, bridge pipes, beams, everything that could be made in here for the future of the country.”
This launch is known as the country’s first downstream lime-manufacturing hub, capable of producing quicklime, clinker, and ultimately cement from quarry to port. This could potentially establish a new export industry as well.
Prime Minister Marape stated, “When not many people had faith in this place, you (PCL) walked this place, looked at the village and felt it was worth investing when many overlooked it. Whilst others have gone around looking for other minerals like gold and copper, you’ve picked up something that is closest to my heart, and that is lime to replace the import of cement. Cement that will lower the cost of construction in PNG.”

PLC confirmed that there will be a road construction linking Kido to Lealea village, connecting the project to the existing LNG plant infrastructure."
Public servants urged to deliver better outcomes,4/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5515,,Government,Anticipation,"James Marape, Joe Sungi","Prime Minister James Marape has challenged Papua New Guinea’s public servants to deliver better outcomes and justify the nation’s K5 billion annual wage bill.
Speaking at the recent Parliament session during the tabling of the 2023–2024 Public Service Report by Minister Joe Sungi, Prime Minister Marape revealed that less than 1.5 per cent of the country’s population consumes nearly a quarter of the national budget through salaries and entitlements.
“Our public service payroll costs K240 million every fortnight. That’s over K5 billion a year going to just under 200,000 people out of a population of over 11 million,” Marape said.
While acknowledging the efforts of committed public servants, especially in remote areas, the Prime Minister stressed the urgency for performance-based reforms.
He said long-standing issues such as overdue retirements and unpaid superannuation are being addressed, with K211 million paid to retirees and over K200 million in outstanding superannuation contributions settled.
Marape also announced the rollout of a digital, merit-based recruitment system to ensure fair and transparent hiring.

During Parliament session on Thursday, July 31 - Minister for Works and Highways, Solan Mirisim put local contractor, Oceanic Construction Ltd, on notice for failing to meet the expected outcomes. Minister Mirisim made the call after concerns were raised by Provincial Member for Southern Highlands William Powi in Parliament.
Oceanic Construction Ltd was engaged for rehabilitation of the Mendi to Nipa section of the road in Southern Highlands Province. Mirisim clarified that K119 million was paid to the contractor when the agreement was signed in 2021. He claimed that the contractor has completed only 36 percent of the road work.
In clarifying remarks made in Parliament, Oceanic Construction Ltd managing director and owner, Sape Molumi has called on Minister Mirisim to rectify his statement on the funds allocated for the road maintenance.
Molumi said the delayed roadwork was due to funding delay from the government.
Table showing expense of the funds
“I am a vulnerable local contractor who has no voice in Parliament and suffer the consequences. Following the question in Parliament, a meeting comprising of Minister Mirisim, Provincial Member Powi, Minister for Defence and Member for Nipa Kutubu, Dr Billy Joseph, Member for Mendi and Vice Minister for Public Enterprise, Raphael Tonpi and Secretary for Works and Highway was convened.
“I accepted the concern by the leaders and expressed my dissatisfaction that the information and response given by Minister was incorrect,” said Molumi.
He claimed that no K34 million payment as advance was received.
“The first payment for mobilization, survey design, establishment and preliminary works was K7,939,600.79 received on December 24, 2021 and second payment of K9,090,910.00 on April 27, 2022 and progressive payment follow till December22, 2024 totaling K74,494,915.80.
“For 2025 no payments received and our claim 17, 18, and 19 still outstanding and at the Department of Works for payment totaling over K8 million,” he stated.
Molumi said the project delay is a result of non-timely payment to support the contractor to progress the project. He said apart from funding delays, there were other site issues affecting the progress of the project.

Strengthen public health through points of entry,3/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5499,,Health,Trust,Nill,"The International Organization for Migration (IOM), in partnership with the Government of Japan and the Pacific Immigration Development Community (PIDC), concluded a series of training aimed at strengthening public health management capacities at points of entry (PoEs) across Papua New Guinea.
The training sessions were delivered under the framework of the Infectious Diseases Border Governance (IBG) Project, officially titled “Strengthening the Capacity of Border Control for Responding to Infectious Diseases in Pacific Island Countries.”
Launched in 2022, the IBG Project supports the socio-economic recovery of the Pacific region by enabling the safe and efficient resumption of border operations through enhanced preparedness and response to infectious diseases.
In this context, IOM conducted a nationwide training on “Public Health Management at Points of Entry” targeting border officials from ports, airports, and ground crossings.
Between 7 June and 18 July 2025, seven two-day training sessions were organized in Lae, Port Moresby, Daru, Vanimo, Kieta, Rabaul, and Madang. A total of 84 border officials participated in the training, representing key institutions including the Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority, National Department of Health, PNG Customs Service, National Agriculture Quarantine and Inspection Authority, PNG Ports Corporation Limited, National Airports Corporation, and the Papua New Guinea Defence Force.
The sessions, facilitated by Dr. Yahya Alamese, covered essential topics such as the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), IOM’s Health, Border and Mobility Management framework, infection prevention and control (IPC), case management, and the development of public health emergency plans.
The training utilized methods such as group work, practical exercises, video presentations, and technical discussions to encourage hands-on learning and engagement.
Participants provided highly positive feedback, noting increased awareness, knowledge, and confidence in applying public health protocols at points of entry. Many expressed interests in more frequent and practical training, emphasizing the need for standard operating procedures, improved inter-agency communication, and the availability of personal protective equipment.
The sessions also fostered stronger coordination among national institutions, which is essential for effective cross-border health security.
Dr. Alamese commended the active participation of trainees and acknowledged the valuable insights they contributed throughout the sessions. He noted a significant improvement in participants’ understanding of public health requirements at PoEs, and encouraged the adoption of a “train-the-trainer” model to sustain capacity-building efforts over the long term.
This training is an essential step toward enhancing Papua New Guinea’s implementation of the International Health Regulations and boosting the country’s preparedness and response capacity at border points.
It reinforces IOM’s commitment to supporting national authorities in safeguarding public health and ensuring the resilience of border operations in the face of health emergencies."
Counting remains in Usino-Bundi,3/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5503,,Politics,Anticipation,Nill,"Counting and declaration of the Usino-Bundi by-election will be held in the district despite the provincial police’s requests to relocate the counting venue to Madang town.
Election Manager Sponsa Navi and the Returning Officer for the Usino-Bundi by-election have maintained that counting and the declaration will remain within the district.
This comes after the Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim, requested last week that the provincial electoral move counting to Madang district due to security issues and recent incidents.
Mr Navi said it would be costly to relocate to Madang and may cause logistical constraints where an additional K1.2M will have to be sourced for the costs involved. He added that the majority of candidates want the count to be hosted within the district as a neutral ground.
“It is the people’s right to see how their vote will elect a new leader, and to observe the processes involved in electing a new MP. I believe manpower is sufficient, and we have taken steps to ensure electricity will not be an issue at night. We have secured a new standby generator for flood lights from the district office,” Mr Navi stated.
Concerning the boxes with issues:
1.	Hijacked box from Bundi LLG – is a disputed box and will not be counted.
2.	300 missing ballot papers from Kesowai (Usino LLG) – box will be counted
Currently, these issues have been raised and will be clarified in a meeting with the election manager today.
Counting is scheduled to commence on Tuesday, August 5, at the Sports Complex in Usino-Bundi. The electoral office said if all goes well, counting is expected to conclude on Sunday, August 10. This will enable ample time for the return of writs on the 22nd August."
PNG welcomes NZ Prime Minister,3/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5507,,Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,"New Zealand Prime Minister, Christopher Luxon, makes a landmark visit to Papua New Guinea on Monday, August 4, ahead of the nation's 50th Independence celebrations.
Prime Minister James Marape has confirmed that PM Luxon will arrive tomorrow for a three-day State Visit – from Monday, 4th to Wednesday, August 6. This visit heralds a major season of diplomatic engagement as Papua New Guinea gears up to commemorate its 50th Independence Anniversary.
Prime Minister Marape hailed the visit as a defining moment in bilateral relations, underscoring New Zealand’s long-standing support for Papua New Guinea’s development, security, and regional stability.
“New Zealand has stood with Papua New Guinea since we gained independence,” Prime Minister Marape said. “From education and climate resilience to trade and governance, their steadfast support has been foundational.”
Upon arrival, PM Luxon is expected to attend High-Level Ceremonies & Parliamentary Address, which includes a State Dinner.
On Tuesday, August 5 (morning), PM Luxon will address the National Parliament of PNG, followed by bilateral discussions on trade, climate resilience, labour mobility, and infrastructure development. On Wednesday, after a farewell ceremony, PM Luxon departs Port Moresby.
“This visit is more than ceremonial—it will fortify people-to-people links, government partnerships, and economic collaboration,” Prime Minister Marape said.
New Zealand plays a vital role in Bougainville’s Peace Process and remains deeply engaged in post-referendum consultations with the Autonomous Bougainville Government and the Government of Papua New Guinea. The Burnham Consultations, hosted at Burnham Military Camp in Canterbury in June 2025, were led by independent moderator Sir Jerry Mateparae and supported by the United Nations.
As a signatory witness to the Bougainville Peace Agreement, New Zealand played a pivotal role in the historic peace process: hosting the 1997 Burnham talks, facilitating a neutral venue for dialogue, and deploying an unarmed Truce Monitoring Group to ensure security during ceasefire negotiations.
In June 2025, both governments agreed during the Burnham Consultations to table the 2019 referendum results, along with a moderator’s report and bipartisan committee findings, before the PNG National Parliament, advancing the region’s political future.
Prime Minister Marape acknowledges New Zealand’s continued support.
“New Zealand’s role as a neutral facilitator and peace partner remains indispensable. Their commitment at Burnham reaffirms our shared dedication to a lasting, homegrown solution for Bougainville’s future.”
PM Luxon’s visit opens a historic season of diplomacy for PNG’s golden jubilee."
CLRC conducts review of colonial laws,3/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5505,,Law,Trust,Nill,"The Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) recently conducted a two-day workshop under its Colonial Law Review Program (CLRP), focusing on the review of the Mercantile Act 1953 and the Public Trustee Act 1951.
The CLRP is integral to the CLRC's mandate, aiming to assess pre-independence laws and evaluate their alignment with Papua New Guinea's contemporary legal and developmental needs.
Both the Mercantile Act 1953 and the Public Trustee Act 1951 were incorporated into the PNG Constitution at independence in 1975, reflecting their colonial origins and the interests they served during that era.
The workshop facilitated in-depth discussions on these statutes, identifying areas for potential reform. Stakeholders, including Bank South Pacific (Legal Unit), the Office of the Public Trustee, the Department of Lands and Physical Planning, and the Department of the Prime Minister and National Executive Council (Legal Unit), provided valuable insights.
Key focus areas included policy frameworks, functional clarity, and the resolution of ambiguities, in relation to key terms used throughout the legislation.
The Mercantile Act 1953 addresses aspects of commercial law, including debt assignments, powers of attorney, and voidable transfers, with the intent to prevent fraud in business transactions. The Public Trustee Act 1951 governs the administration of deceased estates, trusts, and insolvencies, designating the Public Trustee as the statutory trustee.
CLRC Secretary Dr. Mange Matui emphasized the importance of a comprehensive approach to legal reform, stating, ""We are providing this platform for discussion; as an independent law reform agency, we can assist in this space.""
""Reforms must be holistic, considering related laws to ensure our recommendations do not conflict with other existing legislations,” he said.
The feedback gathered will inform the development of a Position Paper, which will be submitted to relevant agencies with recommendations for legislative reform.
The workshop was led by CLRC Deputy Secretary for Legislative Services, Dorothy Mimiko-Kesenga, and CLRC Principal Legal Officer for Colonial Law, Sandon Kikala."

SARV on the rise in Madang,1/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5490,,Societal,Fear,Nill,"Madang Province has faced a significant increase in violence related to sorcery accusations. According to Melanesian Institute research, this alarming trend mainly impacts vulnerable groups, especially women and girls, and the elderly. The Melanesian Institute told this newsroom that the need for information and education in SARV was critical. It successfully delivered the awareness with the support of the Madang Catholic archdiocese and local stakeholders.
Their awareness covered information on what SARV means and how it affects the community; legal means of dealing with sorcery-related issues and the legal consequences of SARV. The program served a critical remainder to youths on how to address issues without cultural and traditional bias.
The awareness program was also conducted in schools across Sumkar, Bogia, and Madang districts. The program was designed for the younger generation so they can engage in discussions and understand SARV.
The Melanesian Institute reported that significant challenges still remain. The province's rugged terrain and a deeply ingrained culture of silence surrounding sorcery-related violence complicate progress.
They also note that many village court officials lack understanding of laws on SARV and how to deal with SARV cases and this hinders the effective enforcement of national laws, which in turn, does little to prevent the rise of sorcery related violence.
At the conclusion of the awareness program, community leaders requested for more of this initiative to help crackdown SARV. They also requested for comprehensive training for village court officers and community police units."
Kokoda Funding Commitment Questioned in Parliament,1/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5487,,Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,"The Sohe MP has asked the Prime Minister to confirm whether a decade-long financial commitment to Kokoda Track communities has been honoured—while urging key leaders including the Minister for Tourism, Arts and Culture, to take note.
Amuli directed his question to Prime Minister James Marape, referencing NEC Decision No. 6 of 2015, which directed K10 million to be allocated each year for ten years to benefit communities along the Kokoda Track. He asked whether the funds had been released and which programs they supported.
“The people of Kokoda region laik save sapos displa K10m we NEC decision em i stap long en, displa K10m ol i rilisim pinis o nogat... and if the government released that money, em rilisim go long wanem ol programs?” Amuli said. (The people in the Kokoda region would like to know if the K10 million committed through an NEC decision, has been released and which programs the funding will support.)
The Kokoda Track, spanning 96 kilometres from Northern province to Central province, runs through 14 council wards—six in Hiri-Koiari LLG and eight in Kokoda LLG. The funding commitment falls under the Joint Understandings 1, 2, and 3 signed between the PNG and Australian governments.
The original Joint Understanding emerged from a high-level PNG-Australia ministerial meeting in Madang in 2008, aimed at preserving the Brown River Catchment, Owen Stanley Ranges, and Kokoda Track region. The three central pillars of this policy are:
1.	Protection of the Kokoda Track,
2.	Sustainable development of communities and environment along the track, and
3.	Conservation of natural and cultural heritage.
This initiative was further strengthened by a second Joint Declaration signed by Prime Ministers Peter O’Neill and Tony Abbott on 10 September 2015, which reaffirmed support for sustainable development and cooperation along the Kokoda corridor.
In response, Prime Minister Marape assured the House that the government would investigate and ensure outstanding commitments are fulfilled.
“I want to give him assurance... to get relevant departments to do assessment on how much has been paid already... and if there is any outstanding then we will enter into a program to make sure that these commitments are caught up at the very earliest,” Marape stated.
The Kokoda Initiative remains the main vehicle for delivering programs under the joint understandings, supporting heritage conservation, community livelihood projects, environmental protection, and tourism.
As the final year of the ten-year funding cycle concludes in 2024, communities along the Kokoda Track await full transparency and accountability."

Be proactive in customary land deals: Parkop,31/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5468,,Politics,Anticipation,"John Rosso, Powes Parkop","Members of parliament today raised debated the amendment to Land Act 1996 which was introduced by the Minister for Lands, Planning and Urbanization and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso. The Amendment would apply to Customary Land use especially for commercial purposes.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop affirmed a proposal by Member for Hiri-Koiari about a penalty clause to be included in the Act.  The penalty would apply to the person who sells the customary land as well as the one who knowingly purchased the land.
Thus Mr. Parkop suggested that the government must be proactive.
“Our people want to assist the government, support development but we are not proactive, so they decide to sell their land, because they have no other ways of income,” Parkop said.
“The other thing too Mr. Speaker I want to mention is that even though this Land Act only covers three per cent of the land in PNG and we talk about the customary land but the fact of the matter is that we are accessing customary land through other Acts - Mining Act, Forestry Act, the Agriculture Act,” he added.
He added that customary land ownership is not an impediment to development and it shows that if investors negotiate with landowners they will cooperate with the government and developers but they must be given all the pros and cons of development in order to make a conscience decision.
Parkop said the government should not be in a rush to covert customary land into state land or into lease, but emphasized ongoing discussion with the landowner."
12th PNGFA Flower Show,30/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5450,,Agriculture,Joy,Nill,"The PNG Floriculture Association Inc proudly launched its 12th Annual Flower Show at the PNG National Museum, Waigani, celebrating the theme: “Where Flowers Tell a Story.” The show runs daily until Sunday August 3. It is open to the public between 8:30am to 5pm. They can experience the various displays of artistic, agricultural, and cultural power of flowers.
Association president Lynn Lantaca, says this year’s theme was chosen because it is significant to their journey as an association since 2009.
Lantaca said over 17 years many members and non-members from different provinces have built decent livelihoods from their flower businesses. This year, the Flower Show is an opportunity for them to share their successes.
“Before, there was not enough demand for cut flowers, but now cut flower demand is high in the city,” she said. “Also, what we expect to get from the flower orders compared to before has changed.”
Quality, quantity and price has changed significantly over the years also.
“A bundle of five to six cut heliconia stems used to be K2,” she said. “Now (it) has changed to two to three cut stems for K2.”
Lancata says the organisation recommends farmers to plant just one type of flower so that they can maintain it well and continuously supply their customer.
On the first day of the Flower Show, judges moved around each of the 15 stalls to observe how green leaves arrangements are presented and arched in front of the stalls' entrance. This year’s arch competition will evolve into more creative stall setups. The criteria is on foliage judging, with focus on green leaves only. They are also looking at arrangements for table posy, extension and A-Line cascading styles. Flower arrangements are not being judged this year"

An honest 50-year review presented to PM,29/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5433,,Politics,Anticipation,"Charles Abel, James Marape, Michael Somare","An honest and independent assessment review of the country’s progress since 1975, initiated by the National Executive Council, was presented to the National Government on Monday, July 28.
Prime Minister James Marape stated that the preliminary report, presented by the 50-Year National Review Committee, chaired by former deputy prime minister Charles Abel and deputised by Arthur Somare.
The report is not about apportioning blame or celebrating blindly; however, it is critically analysing how far PNG has come in 50 years, through identifying weaknesses, recognising strengths, and setting out what must be done to move forward with clarity and purpose.
According to a statement, data and statistics were sourced from credible institutions, including the National Research Institute (NRI), which recently completed its comprehensive PNG 1975–2025 Review, along with inputs from the Consultative Implementation and Monitoring Council (CIMC), UNDP, the Australian National University (ANU), and other local and international agencies.
“From 1975 to 2008, our economy grew below 1 percent annually while the population expanded by over 3 percent. This mismatch has contributed to the structural difficulties we face today, with half of our population under the age of 25. It is a wake-up call.”
The report recommends priority areas for reform, including: Accelerating economic diversification; Improving government efficiency and accountability; Tackling corruption and lawlessness; Investing in human capital and youth opportunities.
Furthermore, PM Marape confirmed that the review is being conducted at arm’s length from political interference, with the committee granted full independence to assess even the performance of his government over the past six years.
“I have instructed the committee to be critical, to be honest, and to tell us what needs fixing — not just in my government, but in the previous two governments under Sir Michael Somare and Peter O’Neill. Not to criticise for the sake of it, but to allow us to correct course as we move forward.”
The final report will be submitted to Cabinet for consideration and then tabled in Parliament, ensuring that all elected leaders participate in shaping PNG’s next 20 years.
“We are not reinventing the wheel. We are building on the foundation of Vision 2050, ensuring we are strategic, focused, and efficient — with an eye toward 2045, when the next generation of leaders can assess and prepare for life beyond 2050.”"

“One strike and you are gone.
“The international developers that come in; once you are arrested, you have breached your work permit and visa condition. So, you can be deported easily.
“That notice has been put forward to protect this sector because there are claims that this sector has been doing well but we are not seeing the revenue going up, the production going up.
“Where are the gold going?
“So, these are some attempts to put in place some controls in any dealings involving this sector.”"

The engagement allows up to three thousand Pacific Island and Timor-Leste nationals, enabling recipients to live, work and study in Australia with long-term flexibility and regional mobility.
This year, Samoa and Kiribati joined the program, alongside continued participation from nations such as Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Tonga, Timor-Leste, and others.
Over fifty-six thousand individuals registered in the 2024-25 ballot, reflecting the program’s strong regional demand. Since its inception in October 2024, more than one thousand PEVs have been issued, with many receipts now settled in Australian communities.
Ministers Tony Burke (Home Affairs), Pat Conroy (Pacific Island Affairs), and Penny Wong (Foreign Affairs) highlighted the program’s role in deepening people-to-people connections, expanding educational and employment pathways, and growing Pacific and Timorese diasporas. Minister Wong affirmed the visa as a reflection of Australia’s commitment to a peaceful, prosperous Pacific region.
PEV holders enjoy lifelong mobility between Australia and their home countries, fostering shared economic benefits and contributing to skills development across the region. The inclusion of Samoa and Kiribati signals broader engagement and renewed commitment to regional inclusion.
Minister Conroy emphasised Australia’s intent to respond to Pacific priorities with integrity and cooperation. The PEV stands as a landmark step in strengthening cultural ties, regional mobility, and sustainable development, benefiting families, communities, and nations alike."
Power outage affects flights,29/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5427,,Aviation,Fear,Nill,"A major power outage occurred at NiuSky head office in Port Moresby on Monday, July 28, that shut down air traffic services for a short period.
The failure was caused by a malfunction in the backup power system (UPS), which keeps essential systems running when the main power goes out.
Unfortunately, this breakdown left air traffic controllers without access to radar, radios, weather updates, or communication lines.
Minister for Civil Aviation Wakw Goi confirmed that as a result, all domestic flights were halted from major airports, and three incoming domestic flights had to be guided in manually using emergency radios.
For international flights flying over PNG, nearby centres in Brisbane (Australia) and Oakland (Los Angeles, USA) were informed, and pilots were told to follow a safety procedure known as TIBA (Traffic Information Broadcast by Aircraft).
However, he said services were fully restored within about 80 minutes, and no accidents or safety incidents occurred.
But, a key aviation notice – Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) could not be sent until later in the day due to system outages, which may raise regulatory concerns.
A preliminary investigation found that the UPS failure was worsened by a failure in the airfield lighting panel.
While the incident was handled professionally, it highlighted risks to the operational systems that need urgent fixing to ensure safety and reliability in the future.
“I have asked our MD for full transparency and quick corrective actions and for a formal investigation to be done and a report to be provided within two weeks,” said Minister Goi."

Police apprehend SARV suspects in Central Province,29/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5417,,Law,Trust,Nill,"Bad road conditions at Bam village in Cloudy Bay LLG, Central Province, did not stop four police vehicles on an operation to apprehend a group of suspects involved in a Sorcery Accusation-Related Violence (SARV) case at Ganai village in Abau District.
The roads from Moreguina, Lalaura, Ganai, and other villages are in a bad state, which has caused them to miss out on most government services, including the lack of police presence.
The Ganai villagers were surprised to see four police vehicles from Port Moresby in the village on Saturday night (July 26) to apprehend suspects involved in a SARV and arson case that occurred two years ago.
The Commander of NCD/Central, Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi, confirmed that there was a report of a SARV case from two years ago that led to a man losing his life and several houses being burnt to ashes.
He said several reports were filed at the local police station in Moreguina, and a copy was forwarded to him after the man who was accused died recently.
Commander Turi said that when the report reached his office, he sought support from the Mobile Squad and the Central Provincial Police Commander, who planned the operation and successfully led to the apprehension of seven suspects.
""I had confirmed that six males and one female are now in police custody to be charged. The suspects are those who were involved in harbouring the main suspects of the SARV case and those who were involved in seriously assaulting a man who died last month at Port Moresby General Hospital. The other suspect was also arrested for burning the SARV suspect's house.
“We are here to help the people of our command, and we will try our best to help solve their issues. We were also told that they were happy to see police in the village to deal with the case that had separated families for some years,"" Turi said.
He added that police will act when information provided to them is accurate. Turi said it is also costly to plan and execute a police operation when information is sketchy and parties involved are not cooperating with the police when asked to come forward.
Commander Turi is pleased with how those suspects behaved when apprehended at Ganai village. The suspects cooperated with the police, who got into the police vehicle and traveled another nine hours back to Port Moresby.
""I was pleased to hear that they assisted the police officers when the police vehicles got bogged down while they were returning to Port Moresby. They also told police officers that most of the government services,  cannot reach them because of the bad road conditions.”
“I am pleased with the police units who executed the operation successfully. It is now a message to others that the police will still come for you if you commit an offense. All we need is detailed information from victims so the police can plan and execute without doubt. This one was a good operation, and I thank the people who lodged the complaint,"" Turi said.
The suspects are detained at Sogeri Police Station, and a CID officer from Central is taking charge of the case.
Commander Turi challenged leaders in his command to work with the police so they can serve the people who need police services."

It’s a welcome sight and sigh of relief as locals put their hopes in this infrastructure development project that means access to more government services.
The machines will be used to move road works towards Simbai station, and progressively link up to an existing route in Simbai which connects to Aiome.
On the other end, the Department of Works and Highways is already pushing into Aiome from Transgogol in South Ambenob.
Member for Middle Ramu Kansol Harwai Kamdaru said the absence of proper road access has for decades crippled the district administration in effectively delivering vital goods and services. It has contributed largely to the stagnant socio-economic status in the district and people are not progressing at all.
Mr Kamdaru said with the road links, locals including small scale farmers can access services including markets to improve their standard of living."

Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim confirmed today that the suspects were brought into Madang town on Saturday night.

He called on candidates to remain calm and let the polling process take its course. He warned other candidates intending to disturb the polling this week to bear in mind that their integrity and reputation are at stake.
“You will disqualify yourself and be a disgrace to your voters and people,” he added.
Kas stated that the by-election is just as real as the upcoming 2027 National General Elections, setting aside rumors suggesting that the by-election is merely a short-term “acting” post for any candidate who wins.
On the other hand, Kas commended security personnel and election coordinators on the ground for being on top of the unraveling situations that occurred during last week’s polling.
“The Electoral Commission and the police deserve credit for continuously being on top of the disturbing events, showcasing transparency and credibility,” Kas stated.
Meanwhile, he recommended that the Electoral Commission increase nomination fees for National General Election candidates, which could potentially deter ill-intentioned candidates.
“PNGEC must seriously consider increasing nomination fees to K10,000 or K20,000. This is the right time to do it as this can deter small-minded candidates from contesting and tarnishing the flow of elections,” Kas said.
He is urging the candidates to remain objective and let the elections continue until the declaration is made."

PNG observes Judiciary Well-being Day,27/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5400,,Health,Trust,Nill,"PNG Judiciary Well-being Day was observed last week at the Waigani Court yard, in collaboration with Pacific International Hospital to promote mental, physical, and emotional well-being within the justice sector.
Judicial officers worldwide mark this day as the first International Day for Judicial Well-being, following its formal adoption by the United Nations General Assembly earlier this year.
The observance stems from the Nauru Declaration of July 2024, which called for urgent attention to the mental, emotional, and physical health of those serving in judicial roles.
In Papua New Guinea, the day was commemorated on Friday, 25th, with a keynote speech by Dr. Ludwig Nanawar, a Senior consultant and visiting psychiatrist of the Laloki Psychiatric Hospital.
He said the International Day of Judicial Well-Being emphasises the importance of the judiciary’s efforts under challenging circumstances, such as the impact of workload, political influence, and extreme circumstances weighing on the physical and mental health of judicial staff.
He defined health as a state of physical, mental, and social well-being, not the absence of disease.
“Mental issues like depression and anxiety often present with physical symptoms, causing a financial burden of mental health conditions and explaining how people with mental health issues often undergo unnecessary tests and spend significant amounts on treatments,” said Dr Nanawar.
He emphasised that the topic of work-life balance must be introduced, with a focus on its role in reducing stress and burnout.
Dr Nanawar said setting boundaries, such as not checking emails after work hours and prioritising tasks and setting boundaries, is good.
“Prioritising tasks and setting boundaries to manage work responsibilities and personal life effectively can help immensely,” he said. Dr Naranwar said delegating tasks reduces stress and workload. He recommends taking breaks from work, such as digital detox and spending quality time with family and friends, as another way to reduce burnout and stress.
He challenges the belief that productivity improves with longer working hours, calling it a myth. Single individuals, who often spend more time at work due to a lack of family commitments, should prioritise work-life balance.
He encourages leaders in agencies to promote a culture of work-life balance and mental health awareness in the workplace.  Dr Nanawar said there is availability of mental health services in hospitals and weekly clinics at the Pacific International Hospital and the Port Moresby General Hospital for them to visit."

“These joint ventures give us a seat at the table — not as silent partners, but as active contributors. Over time, we want to see more of our people in leadership roles, in skilled jobs, in management. We want profits reinvested back into community infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods.

Speaking during the passing-out parade of 158 new Correctional Service officers, Prime Minister Marape congratulated the graduates on completing their training and reminded them of the national significance of their calling.
“You have made yourselves proud, your families proud, and most importantly, your country proud,” the Prime Minister said.
“You are not an ordinary class – you graduate in the year your country celebrates 50 years of independence. That makes you special. You are the generation who must now take this country forward.”

“Take this moment to pledge your full loyalty – not to your tribe, not to your province, not to your family – but to your country,” he urged.
“We must recalibrate our mindset and reset our nation as we celebrate our Golden Jubilee. This starts with those of us in public service.”
He likened his role as Prime Minister not to that of a king or ruler, but as the “number one servant of the country,” welcoming the new officers into the wider family of public servants committed to nation-building.
Prime Minister Marape emphasised the crucial role of Correctional Services in addressing systemic issues such as unemployment, illiteracy, and tribalism, describing the institution as a frontline agency for “correcting the fault lines of our society that are turning into lawlessness.
“CS must not be at the back – it must come to the front,” he said.
“You are not in uniform for yourself, your family or your province. You wear it in the service of the country.”

He closed by invoking God’s blessing on the graduates, their families, the Correctional Services Department, and the entire country.
“May God bless the graduating class of 2025 in this special year of our independence. May God bless Papua New Guinea always.”"

Terms of Reference (TOR) 22 is the review of laws relating to Sexual Offences, the offence of incest in particular. TOR 25 is on the review of laws relating to State-owned enterprises (SOEs).
CLRC is therefore required to research the current legal regime on SOEs and report on the adequacy of its regulation. It is also required to identify the necessary legislative and policy reforms that will address the various legal, policy, and administrative issues relating to SOEs with a view to improving their operations and performance.
The TOR requires CLRC to consider several legislations, including;
•	Kumul Consolidated Holdings Authorization Act 2002,
•	Kumul Consolidated Holdings Authorization (Amendment) Act 2021,
•	Public Finance (Management) Act 1995, and other related laws.
The conclusion of this review will ensure several reform proposals on the appropriate actions that may be taken by the Government to address some of the concerns and issues associated with the lack of performance by some SOEs in order to increase the productivity of SOEs.
TOR 22 requires CLRC to consider several legislations, including;
•	Whether the penalty under section 223 of the Criminal Code should be reinstated to life imprisonment,
•	Whether the definition of incest should be expanded to include adopted and step-related relatives,
•	Whether consent should be a factor in sentencing, especially for adult cases,
•	Whether compensation or statutory customary should be abolished,
•	Need for compulsory sex education implemented in the school curriculum, and
•	Regulate sexually related content in the media
CLRC Chairman Saki Soloma said the launching of the TORs will ensure proper consultations are conducted and that laws are amended to the satisfaction of those affected.
“The issue papers launched today outline the background, key challenges, and legal and policy questions at the heart of each review. Following this launched the issue papers will be taken out for public and stakeholders' views.
“Their views will shape the final report and recommendations, which will be submitted to the government and considered for review by the parliament."
Bugandi prepares for new classroom,26/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5388,,Education,Anticipation,John Rosso,"Three old colonial buildings in Lae’s oldest school – the Bugandi Secondary School – are currently being demolished in preparation for the construction of a new 8-in-1 steel frame classroom for Grade 10.
Significant changes were noted by the member for Lae, John Rosso when Bugandi Secondary School had its administration replaced in 2022.
From no stationery, no uniforms and rundown infrastructure – most of which were built in the 60s – the school has progressed not just in terms of infrastructure, but also academically.
The demolition will make way for Bugandi’s third new 8-in-1 classroom. The first one was opened in 2024 and is currently occupied by Grade 12 students. The second one was opened for Grade 11 students on Monday, 10 February, 2025.
Lae MP, Rosso, highlighted the large influx of people due to rural-urban drift, with the city authority struggling to provide services. However, he stressed that all children deserve and have the right to quality education.
“And that is where the journey started when I first became elected, is that we are investing in our children’s future,” he stated. “Me and my generation are gone. The generation that will replace us is the one sitting behind us that we need to teach good values and discipline and most of all, have proper infrastructure, facilities, proper classrooms and good places of learning.
“Bugandi, the classrooms were built in the 1960s and as you can see, some of them have gone past their expiry date; the floors are broken, it’s overcrowded with 60-70 students to a classroom.”
Rosso outlined that the new 8-in-1 classrooms can hold up to 400 students, including offices for their teachers.
There are plans for another new Grade Nine classroom.
Rosso said teachers’ houses will also be renovated across all schools in Lae.
The MP will attend to one school at a time, when funding is available."

3. Forge Strategic Partnerships: Leverage legal clarity to secure climate finance, bolster community-led conservation, and transition away from carbon-intensive industries.

International Court rules in favor of Pacific Island states,24/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5368,,Law,Trust,Pila Niningi,"The International Court of Justice has ruled in favour of Papua New Guinea and other Pacific Island countries, stating that these countries have legal obligations to prevent and address the harmful impacts of climate change.
The court, in its Advisory Opinion, found that the countries have binding legal obligations under international law and customary international law to prevent and address the harmful impacts of climate change.
The decision follows a request from the United Nations General Assembly for an Advisory Opinion regarding the climate change obligation of states. The initiative for this Advisory Opinion was championed at the United Nations by Vanuatu, inspired by a youth-led campaign calling for climate justice and legal accountability. This youth-driven movement underscored the urgency of international legal action in response to the worsening climate crisis.
According to the Minister for Justice and Attorney General Pila Niningi, PNG was among other countries that made an oral submission to the World Court, advocating for stronger legal accountability in the face of rising global emissions. The case was heard in December 2024.
“In our submission, we rallied with Vanuatu and other countries for this outcome. We are pleased with the outcome,” Minister Niningi said.
Minister Niningi led PNG’s representation which included PNG Ambassador to the United Nations Fred Sarufa, Secretary for the Department of Justice and Attorney General (DJAG) Dr Eric Kwa, Public Solicitor Leslie Mamu, and then Acting Solicitor General E'ava Geita. The team also comprised DJAG lawyers, Office of the Public Solicitor, and the Climate Change and Development Authority.
The World Court made the following key findings:
•	States must take action under both international treaties (e.g., UNFCCC, Paris Agreement, UNCLOS) and customary international law to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and protect the climate system;
•	Due diligence standards are high: States must adopt and enforce robust legal, regulatory, and policy activities to prevent environmental harm. Small Island Developing States were specifically recognized as especially vulnerable and legal protection from climate-related harm;
•	 States that breach their obligations, through acts or omissions, can be held responsible under international law for resulting harm to other States, peoples, and future generations;
•	The Court recognized climate change as a human rights issue, affirming the interdependence between environmental protection and rights to life, health, water, housing, and a clean and sustainable environment.
The Court's Opinion carries significant legal and political weight, and will;
•	Strengthen the legal basis for SIDS and vulnerable nations to demand meaningful climate action and support;
•	Serve as an authoritative guide for interpreting and applying international climate treaties, especially in the context of litigation and policy-making;
•	Provide a legal foundation for holding major emitters accountable where their emissions cause significant harm;
•	Reinforce Papua New Guinea's efforts to pursue international cooperation, climate financing, and technical assistance as a matter of legal entitlement, not charity;
•	Support integration of international climate and human rights standards into national laws, policies, and enforcement frameworks.
“This is a moment of immense pride for Papua New Guinea. Our voice was heard at the world's highest court,” Minister Niningi said. “The ruling confirms that climate justice is not just a political goal, it is a legal imperative.”
“I encourage all relevant agencies to use this decision to strengthen our domestic laws, advocate internationally, and protect our people and ecosystems for generations to come.
“Papua New Guinea reaffirms its commitment to working in solidarity with other small island nations and the international community to achieve effective, equitable, and legally grounded climate action,” Niningi added."

Pariwa commits to 80K for Lalok village,23/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5346,,Politics,Hope,Ramsey Pariwa,"The Provincial Member for Madang Ramsey Pariwa visited Lalok village in the Astrolabe Bay Local Level Government in Rai Coast district, on Sunday July 20, 2025 – the first political leader to visit with the locals there.
Mr Pariwa was invited to the traditional yam harvest festival. During the event he made a commitment of K50,000 towards the new Lalok primary school, K10,000 to the Lalok Sports Association and another K20,000 for economic development activities.
The provincial member acknowledged Lalok village as one of the most populated villages in the Astrolabe Bay LLG and for having a colourful history. Lalok played host to the first Rhenish Mission Society (RMS) in German New Guinea during the colonial era in the 1880s.
The RMS were a prominent German Protestant missionary organization that played a significant role in spreading Christianity to various parts of the world including New Guinea. The arrival of its missionaries to PNG shores was at Lalok village, where they established contact with neighboring villages in the Astrolabe Bay.
Lalok community leader Tigan Sangi took the opportunity to express his dissatisfaction at the neglect by political representatives over the years. His hope is that the provincial member’s visit will remind political representatives that Lalok village need support too."

The celebration was graced by Simbu Governor Noah Kool, Simbu Provincial Administrator John Punde, and Provincial Police Commander Mazuic Maipe, who acknowledged the historic role of police in Simbu, including those who served before and during independence.
Commander Maipe led the parade alongside Mobile Squad Unit 08 and local officers. “We marched today (Monday) with pride, not only as police officers but as servants of humanity.

Marape Defends Appointment of New KPHL Board in the Face of Court Order,23/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5351,,Politics,Anger,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape says the government will strongly defend its position following  what he termed as a  “surprise ex parte court order” obtained by former Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) Chairman, Dr Benedict Yaru.
Dr Yaru, who served for more than two terms—amounting to nine years— applied for the interim order in the absence of representation from the State or the trustee shareholder.
“This matter was taken to court in secret, without notifying the State or giving us the opportunity to be represented. An ex parte order was obtained, and we were only made aware after the fact,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“I want to assure the country that the State will respond once the order is formally served, and we will defend our position based on sound legal advice.”
Prime Minister Marape explained that the changes to the KPHL Board were made following due process and in accordance with legal guidance from the State Solicitor.
“The advice we received confirmed that a vacancy existed, and that the trustee shareholder—the Prime Minister—is legally empowered to appoint a new board. These appointments were necessary to restore proper governance oversight at Kumul Petroleum,” he said.
“It must be noted that most of the outgoing board members had already served two full terms—the legal maximum of eight years. In fact, Dr Yaru served nine years. One member had also surpassed the compulsory retirement age of 72.”
Prime Minister Marape further stressed that KPHL Board positions are not personal entitlements and must be refreshed regularly to ensure continued accountability and oversight.
“The KPHL Board is not owned by any one individual. Leadership must be rotated to bring in new perspectives and strengthen scrutiny of management.”
He also defended the appointment of Gerea Aopi as the new KPHL Chairman, describing him as a seasoned leader in the oil and gas sector.
“Mr Aopi is a highly respected Papua New Guinean with a distinguished record in both the public and private sectors. He knows the oil and gas industry, understands the strategic importance of Kumul Petroleum, and is well placed to guide its future growth.”
Prime Minister Marape concluded by stating that the Government will not be distracted by attempts to undermine the reform process at KPHL.
“Any citizen has the right to seek legal redress, and we respect that. However, we will robustly defend our position, which is based on sound legal advice, a commitment to transparency, and the need for a fresh board to provide oversight of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Ltd in our national interest."
PM pays tribute to fallen heroes,23/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5345,,Nation,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape pays tribute to Papua New Guinea’s ‘fallen heroes’ as the nation observes National Remembrance Day today.
This year’s commemoration holds even deeper significance as PNG celebrates 50 years of Independence this September 16 — a milestone of nationhood achieved through the courage, sacrifice, and resilience of those who served and defended the country, beginning with the World War II generation.
“As we stand on the shoulders of heroes and celebrate 50 years as an independent nation, we pause to honour those whose blood was shed so we could be free,” said Prime Minister Marape.
“Remembrance Day is not only a day of tribute - it is a reminder of our duty to uphold the values they fought for.”
Remembrance Day also reflects on the enduring friendship between PNG and Australia, forged in the crucible of war during the historic Kokoda Campaign of 1942.
Papua New Guinean carriers, famously known as the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels, supported wounded Australian troops through treacherous jungle conditions, embodying humanity, bravery, and unity under fire.
Last year (2024), this historic bond was symbolically renewed when Prime Minister Marape and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese walked the Kokoda Track together, retracing the footsteps of soldiers and carriers from both nations.
“Walking Kokoda with Prime Minister Albanese was more than a physical journey - it was a spiritual honour,” Marape said.
“It reminded both our nations of the deep, shared history that binds us. The brotherhood between Papua New Guinea and Australia was born on those muddy, sacred trails, and it lives on today.”
The walk marked the first time that the Prime Ministers of both countries undertook the pilgrimage together, sending a strong signal of bilateral solidarity, remembrance, and regional cooperation.
National Remembrance Day, observed annually on July 23, honours all Papua New Guineans who served in military and defence roles from World War II to today, including peacekeeping missions and national operations.
“As we celebrate our golden jubilee of independence, may we honour our defenders by being a people of unity, service, and purpose,” said Marape.
Across the nation in designated locations, ceremonies, flag raisings, and tributes are being held.
Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed his government’s commitment to strengthening the PNG Defence Force and building national pride through education, training, and regional partnerships.
“Our heroes left us a legacy - our task now is to build a stronger, more secure and sovereign nation. We will continue investing in our Defence Force, and in shaping a generation of citizens who love and defend this country with honour.”
“We are one people, from many tribes, bound by the memory of sacrifice and the dream of a greater Papua New Guinea. Let this Remembrance Day stir in us pride, gratitude, and determination to rise together for the next 50 years and beyond.”"
A recollection of the unsung heroes by Madang PPC,23/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5340,,National,Trust,Nill,"This morning, I woke up early, sitting quietly in my room, reflecting on the journey of this young nation over the past fifty-plus years. As I gaze into the memories of the past, I am reminded of the sacrifices made by countless heroes - those who fought bravely during World War II, including my own late dad.
My late dad used to tell us tales and experiences of how he fought side by side with fellow soldiers, joining the allied forces on the coastlines of Morobe and Madang to defend freedom and peace. Today, I understand the profound significance of this day - the day we honor those who laid down their lives for our future.
I also recall the Bougainville crisis, where I actively participated in restoring peace to our land. I remember the comrades we lost during those turbulent times, and the sacrifices they made for our nation’s stability and unity.
These memories inspire me to uphold the oath I took—to serve my country without fear, favor, or malice.
I served in Bougainville because I believe in one people, one nation. My sacrifice was driven not by personal gain, but by love for my homeland, my family, and my people - so that peace and unity may prevail.
Today, I stand in respect and gratitude for all the heroes who sacrificed for our well-being. I especially honor my late dad, whose sacrifices paved the way for the life I live today.
To all the heroes - your courage and sacrifice will never be forgotten. I salute you.

Police band recognized,23/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5348,,Culture,Joy,Nill,"Since the 1970s to the 1980s, four pioneers who joined the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary band have been privileged to perform on home soil during the 2025 Pacific Police Tattoo held yesterday at the Sir Hubert Murray Stadium in the nation's capital.
The band, led by Director of Music, Inspector Lucas Nege, and is managed by Band Master Inspector Alu Kapa. The band was formed in 1938 in Nodup Village near Rabaul after the musical talents of local village boys were noticed by the founder and band master, the late David Crawley.
Regional bands based in Rabaul, Mount Hagen, Madang, and Port Moresby were brought together in 1975, and since 1982, the band has been based in Port Moresby. The band currently has 90 members, including six pioneer policewomen, and performs regularly on the international stage in places such as Australia, Japan, England, and Scotland.
However, most of the pioneers retired, with others passing on, leaving only four pioneers standing strong to hold the band together 50 years after PNG gained independence. They are Sergeant John Api, Inspector Lucas Nege, Inspector Alu Kapa, and Chief Sergeant Richard Gei.
Director Nege said being recognized as the best drill performers on home soil signifies the band’s commitment and the efforts, they put into practicing one year ahead of the Tattoo.
“We've been preparing for this Tattoo event since last year, and to get an award is not a surprise because we worked very hard. The result of our hard work speaks for itself today,” Nege said.
He said this achievement is history in the making, not only for the band but an achievement for the people of PNG. As they transition into the retirement era, their contributions to the band will have a lasting impact on future band members and an inspiration to future generations."

Polling concludes in Kabwum,23/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5343,,Politics,Anticipation,Patrick Basa,"Polling in the Kabwum by-election has concluded with the extraction of the first lot of ballot boxes and papers to Lae, in Morobe Province.
Kabwum’s returning officer, James Neapukali, landed in Lae this morning with the six ballot boxes from Selepet local level government.
The people of Kabwum district never had a political representative since the Electoral Commissioner’s declaration of Patrick Basa ‘under special circumstances’ was nullified by the court in 2023.
They are now a step closer to having their voices represented at the national level with the conclusion of polling for the Kabwum Open seat.
Neapukali said this morning, the six ballot boxes from Selepet LLG were extracted to Lae on a chopper.
Under the watchful eyes of Mobile Squad 15, the ballot boxes were put into containers at the Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium, where counting is scheduled to take place.
Neapukali outlined that they had no issues with teams from Selepet, Komba and Deyamos due to road accessibility, compared to Yus.
“The road conditions are not good but vehicles could use them so policemen were able to go to the polling sites,” he stated.
“Only for Yus, because of no network coverage there, we could not get in touch with all the teams. But we did manage to get in contact with three teams that were going towards Teptep, towards the Madang side, so the network there was working and they reported to us that they had already completed.
“Otherwise, manpower in Kabwum is ok, compared to the last general election.
“And this time we have MS 15; all sections of MS 15, including one section of SRU (Special Response Unit) and police from the provincial headquarters as well.”
Since the Usino-Bundi by-election in Madang Province is also underway, Neapukali said the chopper is alternating between the two polling districts.
In spite of a few challenges, such as voters getting frustrated when their names are not in the electoral roll, Neapukali said the team managed to peacefully conclude polling and are now looking forward to starting the counting process."

New KPHL board appointment stayed,22/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5337,,Business,Anger,James Marape,"The appointment of Gerea Aopi as the new board chairman of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited and the subsequent appointment of three other board members by the Prime Minister James Marape as the trustee of KPHL was stayed by the National Court today.
Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika delivered the ruling this afternoon after the applicant, Dr Benedict Yalu who is the chairman of KPHL filed an exparte application seeking the court to grant him leave to dispense with the requirement for filing and service of the Originating Summons, Notice of Motion, affidavit in support and undertaking as damages.
He sought three orders pending this application of which all three orders were granted:
a)	The National Court stayed the Prime Minister’s decision to appoint Gerea Aopi as the Chairman of KPHL on June 10, 2025, and the decision issued on June 26, 2025 for the appointment of George Gware, Jacob Anga, and Sundaram Srinivasan as directors of KPHL pending hearing and determination of the proceeding.
b)	Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika also ordered that the decisions made by the Defendant on June 10, 2025 and on June 26, 2025 assuming that Dr Benedict Yaru, Dr lla Temu and Paul Nerau, and Peterson Pipj, Hari Karyuliarto, have been retired and removed as Chairman and directors of KPHL, by operation of the Petroleum Holdings Limited Authorization Act 2015, and therefore further assuming that there is no board or quorum in place, be stayed pending hearing and determination of the proceeding.
c)	And the court further ordered that the defendant (Prime Minister James Marape) and his agents, servants, associates, delegate and persons directed by them or whomsoever be restrained from relying on and giving effect to the instrument issued by the defendant dated June 10, 2025 and the further instruments.
The Court heard that on May 07, 2025, the Board of KPHL through the Chairman, informed the Prime Minister as the Trustee of the Kumul Petroleum Share Trust ('Trustee') that there were three (3) vacancies in the Director positions.
On 10 June 2025, the Prime Minister appointed Gerea Aopi as Chairman and on 26 June 2025, the Prime Minister, acting as the Trustee of KPHL, made appointments of  new Directors to the KPHL Board, citing reasons that there was no quorum in the board.
However, the applicant (Dr Benedict Yalu) told the court that these appointments were not made in accordance with Section 10 of the Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited Authorization Act 2015 (the KPHL Act), which clearly sets out how such appointments must be made.
Dr Benedict Yalu has been the Chairman of Kumul petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) since the commencement of KPHL in 2015 along with several other Directors to whom he is representing in this proceedings."

Jets acknowledge Hunters,22/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5334,,Sports,Anticipation,Nill,"Placed sixth on the QRL Hostplus Cup competition, Ipswich Jets coach praised PNG Hunters for their impressive first-half match in which they scored five unanswered tries, taking a commanding 28-0 lead by halftime.
The Jets mounted a remarkable comeback, but could not catch up with the intensity put up by the Hunters, falling short 28-22 at full-time.
Jets coach Tye Ingebrigtsen acknowledged that it was a game of two halves, with the Jets rallying in the second half to score four unanswered tries themselves.
""PNG were outstanding in that first half. We knew they would be, as they are such a strong team with powerful runners. Paul is doing a great job here, and we recognized that they needed this win given their position on the ladder. Unfortunately, we didn't come out strong, whereas they did, and they deserved that first-half lead. They were outstanding,"" Ingebrigtsen said.
The Jets made adjustments in the second half, modifying their game plan to move the ball more effectively and utilizing kicks to score, as they struggled to penetrate the Hunters' defensive line.
Ingebrigtsen said, “We talked about throwing the ball around in the second half. Our original plan was to go through the middle, but PNG defended that area so well in the first half that we had to adapt. We just ran out of time,"" he explained.
He also noted the challenges posed by the hot conditions in Port Moresby, which the players were not accustomed to, but expressed confidence that the team would regroup and focus on their upcoming match in round 19 coming weekend."
ABG presents K1 million to MAF to re-establish presence in the region,22/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5332,,Development,Joy,Nill,"The Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) presented a cheque of K1 million to Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) to re-establish its aviation services in the region.
The cheque is part of the ABG’s financial support toward MAF’s Phase 1 infrastructure projects following the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the ABG and the MAF earlier this year.
Presenting the cheque yesterday on behalf of the ABG, Chief Secretary Kearnneth Nanei said the gesture symbolised the government's appreciation and ongoing partnership with MAF, following the signing of the MoU in which President Ishmael Toroama committed K1 million in support.
“Today, it gives me great pleasure and honour on behalf of the President, ABG and people of Bougainville to handover this K1million cheque to MAF of PNG as ABG’s commitment to reestablish MAF in Bougainville,” he said.
Nanei reiterated that the presentation showed ABG’s commitment towards building and opening up the airspace in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (AROB) and the ABG’s commitment to further align with MAF’s priorities on the ground to re-establish and re-develop MAF as a third level airline throughout AROB.
The Chief Secretary further noted that the funding aligns with ABG’s broader goals of accessibility and connectivity across the region as contained in the Bougainville Vision 2052, Bougainville Integrated Strategic Development Plan 2023-2027 and the soon-to-launched Bougainville Transport Master Plan.
“This is all aligned with these critical blueprints that within the next ten years we are required to open up the skies within Bougainville and re-access our airstrips in Nissan, Buin, Torokina, Oria and in mountainous communities,” he said.
He acknowledged the services that MAF had provided during the pre-conflict days and said that it is not only a partnership with the government but with the churches and the people of AROB who have been in partnership with MAF during the Boug-Air days.
Nanei further added that he is aware that the MAF will use ABG’s support to build an aircraft hangar at the Buka airport, paving the way for an enduring partnership.
“We look forward to the partnership in building the hangar and eventually a taxi way, at least this will be a significant milestone for our partnership, and I see this as an enduring partnership,” he said.
MAF Launch Team Director John Woodberry upon receiving the cheque thanked the ABG for its support and also acknowledged Bishop Abraham Toroi and the Bougainville Christian Council of Churches who have been key partners in inviting MAF back to Bougainville.
“Your contribution to MAF is a gigantic first step to helping MAF establish again in Bougainville. MAF has a history in Bougainville from 1968 to 1978 in helping launch Boug-Air and we have the heart to bring health, hope and healing to remote people in communities around Bougainville,” he said.
Woodberry confirmed that the valuable contribution will be applied directly to the construction of their aircraft hangar at Buka airport.
“This hangar is a crucial part of establishing our aviation operations in AROB and will enable us to serve isolated communities with essential health, education, governance, church support and other crucial services,” he said.
MAF aims to launch its operations once the hangar is completed, staffed and an aircraft is based in Bougainville by early 2026."

PNGETV 2027 ready for September launch,21/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5323,,Education,Trust,Nill,"The Department of Education has concluded the consultations to finally complete writing the Papua New Guinea Education Transformation Vision 2075 (PNGETV 2075). The Department plans to launch document during the country’s 50th Independence celebrations in September.
The final consultation was conducted in close consultation with the National Research Institute (NRI) on Wednesday 9 July 2025, bringing the Ministry of Education and Papua New Guinea closer to launching a comprehensive 50-year roadmap for the future of education in PNG.
In his address, Secretary for Education, Dr. Uke Kombra, emphasised the importance of wide stakeholder consultations and contributions to shape and complete the document so that it is owned by each and every Papua New Guinean.
""You all play a very critical role in the education system. Our education system would not have come this far without the partnership and the contributions that you have made as development partners, church representatives, teachers, and the different roles you play in the education space.
This document, which we hope to launch by September, will not be complete and cannot be launched without the involvement and contributions from stakeholders in the education sector,"" Dr. Kombra stated.
The Secretary thanked Dr. George Bopi, the lead technical advisor, and his dedicated team, Teddy Winn and Maureen Yali, for their efforts in driving the PNGETV 2075 project. He also all the participants, including development partners, church representatives, and teachers, for their invaluable contributions.
The PNGETV 2075, a long-term vision spanning from 2026 to 2075, aims to establish a future direction for PNG's education system to be inclusive, adaptive, and transformative.
The Secretary highlighted the significant growth of the education sector since independence, with teacher numbers increasing from 6,000 to over 70,000, and student enrolment reaching close to 2.7 million across more than 13,000 schools.
Despite this progress, Dr. Kombra acknowledged persistent challenges, particularly to do with relevant curriculum and student retention.
""Our curriculum is being critiqued as not being relevant to equip the children for the next life they will pursue in society,"" he noted.
However, he reaffirmed the Department's commitment to addressing these issues through the new vision.
The core principle guiding the PNGETV 2075 is to ensure that every child, regardless of gender, disability, economic status, or geography, receives the best quality education he or she deserves. This aligns with the constitutional directive for the education sector to lead in integral human development.
The consultation process for PNGETV 2075 has been extensive, involving a steering committee chaired by the Minister for Education and a dedicated technical team for the past one to two years.
Dr. Kombra reiterated that the final document will reflect the widespread inputs, reflecting the collective aspirations of Papua New Guineans.
""It should not be a document that is written in Vulupindi Haus or by the Education Department. It must be a document that must include the input and views of everyone in the society,"" he stated.
The 50-year vision will serve as a guiding framework, informing National Education Plans for every 10-year period, which will then be cascaded into three-year corporate plans and provincial education implementation plans.
The Secretary thanked participants for their time and contributions and added that the team from the PNGETV 2027 Secretariat will include their comments and advice in the final document."

Challenges faced by first years,21/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5324,,Education,Sadness,Nill,"It’s always a tough transition when students from secondary schools enter tertiary institutions for the first time.
This was one of the papers presented at the recent 6th Pacific Islands Universities Regional Network (PIURN) conference, at the PNG University of Technology in Lae, Morobe Province.
The research paper was titled: “The transition of secondary students into higher tertiary education: the perspectives of Divine Word University, Madang province, Papua New Guinea”.
It was authored by Divine Word University’s head of rehabilitation sciences & physiotherapy department, Rhonda Wohemani, and the postgraduate senior liaison officer from the Solomon Islands National University, Emelda Ariku.
Wohemani explained that since teaching at the Divine Word University for the last 15 years, she and Ariku identified some challenges and barriers that affect first year students.
“They were struggling with how they can academically cope with the life,” stated Wohemani. “Coming from a structured system of education, and just throwing them into a higher institution where there are flexible times and everything is just there; they found it very difficult to cope with the academic life and that was why we decided to do a study on it.
“The main purpose was to identify challenges and barriers secondary students experience when transiting into higher tertiary institutions.”
One of the main challenges identified by Wohemani and Ariku was adapting to a new environment.
One of the students interviewed highlighted the language barrier between rural and urban students, especially when they are in the same accommodation. While urban students have no problem communicating in English, those from the rural areas have difficulties expressing themselves fluently in English.
“The other one was with e-learning,” continued Wohemani. “Since Divine Word is on top of digital learning and everything is done online with less paper used; the problem of students was, how they could adjust to it.
“If they had been introduced in secondary school about how to use computers and how to, for example, do ‘flipped classroom’, then smooth transition will happen when they go into their first year – foundation.
“The other one was a support system for non-academic and academic programs on campus as well.
“Yes, Divine Word has a support system like mentoring programs, psycho-education, Toastmasters and counselling sessions. We’ve identified that it needs to be strengthened. Yes, we have it, but why don’t we strengthen it by having it on a weekly basis.”
The presenters recommended that students be exposed to the flipped classroom approach, or blended learning, while they are still in secondary school. This type of learning is where students access new content at home – either videos or readings – then later engage in interactive activities with their teachers.
Ariku, who relocated to the Solomon Islands last year, said the qualitative study involved 15 first year DWU students in the first semester – from January to May 2025.
“I was working at DWU as a graduate researcher and a tutor for the last four years,” explained Ariku. “As a lecturer in the Department of Health Management and System Development, under the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, I identified this gap and was motivated to do research in this area.”
Research is still continuing, and the presenters hope to expand the study to other universities to help bridge the gap for transitioning students."
Highlands Day Celebration marred by overcrowding and violence,20/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5308,,Event,Fear,Nill,"The third PNG Story celebration - Highlands Day - drew thousands to Sir Hubert Murray Stadium on Saturday, July 19, with a full day of cultural festivities that honoured the rich traditions of the Highlands region.
The event, organised by the Office of the NCD Governor and NCDC as part of PNG’s 50th Independence lead-up, began on a high note but ended with serious public safety concerns.
The day opened with a float parade led by UPNG Highlands students, representing each Highlands province.
The colourful convoy traveled from the UPNG campus to the stadium, setting the tone for a spirited celebration ahead.
Once at the stadium, attendees were treated to traditional performances, music, food stalls, and cultural displays that highlighted the vibrant identity of the Highlands people.
The free-entry event encouraged widespread community participation, showcasing the spirit of unity under the banner One City. One Kantri. One Future.
By evening, however, authorities raised the alarm as the stadium reached full capacity. The Royal PNG Constabulary issued public safety warnings on social media, advising the public to avoid the Kone area as roads were blocked off to control the overwhelming flow of traffic.
Unfortunately, the night descended into chaos in some areas, with vehicles stoned by crowds attempting to reach the stadium.
A police vehicle was also attacked, and several civilians were injured and rushed to the hospital. Police confirmed ongoing patrols around the Sir Hubert Murray Stadium, urging residents to report incidents and remain cautious if travelling nearby.
While Highlands Day successfully celebrated culture and identity, the lack of crowd control and security response capacity exposed serious concerns for future large-scale public events."
Masiu is alive and well,20/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5314,,Politics,Disgust,Timothy Masiu,"Following a Facebook post claiming that Minister for Information and Communications Technology, and South Bougainville MP, Timothy Masiu, passed on this morning in Cairns, Australia, is not true.
Minister for Police and Regional Member for Bougainville, Peter Tsiamalili Jr, confirms that Minister Masiu is alive and well. Tsiamalil said the FB poster will be identified and prosecuted.
“Contrary to a fake Facebook post claiming that Minister Masiu passed away in Cairns, Australia, I can unequivocally state that our good Minister is alive, well, and in good spirits.
“I was personally with Minister Masiu in Cairns from Monday to Thursday last week, after he was airlifted on Sunday, 15 July 2025, for precautionary medical tests following a low blood level reading.”
Minister Masiu has since been discharged from Cairns Base Hospital and has been advised by his attending doctor to rest and recover.
“I also spoke with Minister Masiu a short while ago, and I can assure our government and people, including those in South Bougainville, that he is in high spirits and very much alive,” said Minister Tsiamalili.
He confirmed that the Prime Minister has been briefed on both the fake news incident and Minister Masiu’s current health and recovery.
Minister Tsiamalili added, “It is truly disheartening to see a minority of Papua New Guineans stoop so low as to spread fake news and misinformation about fellow citizens in such a harmful way.”
“Rest assured, the Government, through the Department of Information and Communications Technology, acted swiftly this morning to trace and identify the source of the fake Facebook post.
“I have been advised that two individuals behind the posts have already been identified and that several Facebook accounts have been taken down.”
“We are working quickly to get to the bottom of this and ensure the perpetrators are held accountable. Such behaviour has no place in our society,” Minister Tsiamalili said."
Legacy issues affect Modilon hospital service delivery,20/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5316,,Health,Sadness,Nill,"The Madang Provincial Health Authority (MaPHA) has undergone negative speculations arising from lack of facilities, deteriorating infrastructures, medicine shortages and an overall decline in basic health services in the recent months.
MaPHA chairman, Dr. Figa Boga has come out to clear the air as to why these issues have eventually spilled over in recent years, claiming that it is a legacy issue which has encapsulated its current administration, crippling the flow of services. However, Dr. Boga is adamant that steps are being pursued to ensure the adversities are reined on.
Dr. Boga explained how in 2019 when the Health Authorities were established nationwide, Madang’s Modilon General Hospital was left without a Board until September 2024, running operations without an overseer. In addition to its establishments, the Authorities nullified all Acts of prevalent governing and external avenues of funding, especially from provincial sources.
This merger did not work out with the structuring resulting in discrepancies arising, such as in Madang’s case, a total of 400 positions remained vacant with staff performing under casual basis. Overall Dr. Boga also highlights that even during its establishment, there were no proper Corporate Plans or Health Plans created in order to attract funding.
It is understood that the hospital itself plus its operations costs approximately K18 million per annum, however, for this year’s budget, it is stated that submission was made for K22.5 million. With the Board’s intention of laying out new priority projects, not much can be availed to carry out these activities resulting in the crippling effect that has taken its toll on the institution.
Dr. Boga also shed light on a K15 million which was given by the then Minister for Health Dr. Tom Lino in 2022 for the hospitals use, however, this funding was unavailable due to the lack of a Board in that period. This has now been sought out and the Board anticipates its release in the coming week.
Without denying claims made by members of the public on MaPHA’s deteriorating state, Dr. Boga acknowledges that current infrastructures need to be replaced by modern structures, those ongoing projects of the outpatient, emergency and wards will be under construction soon to be completed after years in standstill.
The Board deliberated in an emergency meeting that K1. 4m will be used from the K15 million to complete the outpatient, A&E and mothers’ ward.
They will also look into alternate sustainable power and water supply sources for the hospital; however, he thanked the Madang Provincial Government for stepping in committing two Southern Crosses which will replace the current ones which has been erected since the 1960’s.
While the challenges remain for the Board and its administrative team in the forefront, a bustling and robust effort is in play in the background trying to realign MaPHA into place."
Parkop receives Tete’s clinical services plan,20/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5310,,Health,Trust,Powes Parkop,"The Clinical Services Plan of the new provincial specialist hospital at Tete in Port Moresby’s North West Electorate was presented to the NCD Governor, Powes Parkop recently.
The National Capital District Provincial Health Authority’s Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Robin Oge and covers all necessary clinical services and support services that will be provided at the new hospital.
Governor Parkop approved the Clinical Services Plan for the proposed Level 5 Provincial Specialist hospital for NCD.
He further emphasized that all future plans for the construction and expansion of other health facilities in the National Capital District have to be properly planned to meet the standards.
Chairman of NCD Provincial Health Authority, Daniel Waswas said the Health Service plan will help fulfill the vision of the National Capital District Commission to deliver effective health services in the NCD. He acknowledged the support from the office of the NCD governor and the NCD District Development Authorities.
CEO of NCD PHA Dr. Robin Oge said the proposed state-of-the-art Level 5 Provincial Specialist Hospital, as presented in the Clinical Service Plan, will cater for Secondary and Tertiary care services.
He said the hospital will serve as a crucial referral hub by receiving patients from Level 2,3 and 4 facilities within NCD, Central Province and Gulf Province.
“The most complex and sub-specialty cases will be referred to Port Moresby General Hospital, allowing it to carry out its role as the National Tertiary Referral Hospital,” said Dr. Oge.
This will reduce the burden at PMGH because it is overwhelmed with patients seeking primary health care services.  The hospital will also support all health facilities across NCD through outreach and serve as a vital training ground for future health professionals.
The boards and management of the NCD Provincial Health Authority are working towards improving the health service delivery in the National Capital District through improving health facility infrastructure and collaboration with the National Capital District Commission and the three District Development Authorities of Port Moresby."

The six-week programme started on July 14th and will resume from August 18th to 22nd.
The initiative aims to build confidence, creativity, and pathways into the arts for students in Grades 9 to 11 in the National Capital District Schools.
Since its inception in 2016, YAP has reached over 600 students annually from more than 15 schools, tutors from MAT and student teachers from UoG mentor participants, blending arts training with social awareness. NGOs and local organisations also join in, using theatre as a platform to engage youth on critical issues.

TVI Building Local Leadership & Collective Action,18/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5291,,Social,Trust,Nill,"Over the last four years local civil society organization, The Voice Inc. (TVI) has been strategically engaging with governments, community organizations, civil societies and its network of leaders, building coalitions to progress policy and reform on some of Papua New Guinea’s most critical issues such as Sorcery Accusation Related Violence (SARV), Youth Opportunities and Early Childhood Learning.
Key to its efforts is the Problem Driven Iterative Adaptation (PDIA) Course facilitated by the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and offered through TVI’s Local Leadership and Collective Action Program (LLCAP).
The PDIA course is a challenging 12-week program which helps teams break down problems into root causes, identify entry points and act. The program has been delivered with governments and reformers around the world including LLCAP leaders in PNG since 2022.
Through the PDIA, TVI has been able to engage with 112 local leaders. These exceptional leaders include community advocates, organizational executives, public servants and government secretaries among others.
TVI Executive Director, Maliwai Sasingian said the organization has seen tangible results from engaging with the three cohorts that have gone through this course. These engagements have led to key partnerships and strategic interventions that LLCAP actively supports.
“Through the PDIA process, we have been able to mobilize and support key coalition actions such strengthening referral pathways and access to justice for survivors of SARV with key stakeholders on the frontline addressing the issue in Kundiawa, Simbu Province.
“Through our continued engagement with this important coalition and learnings from the PDIA, TVI in partnership with the Catholic Diocese of Kundiawa, established a free SARV Legal Help Desk in 2023 with a fulltime lawyer to assist partners in progressing their SARV cases. This is among many examples of the utilization of key concepts within the PDIA course,” said Sasingian.
Other key partnerships that have come to fruition through the PDIA process include Memorandum of Understandings (MOAs) and Joint Workplans with the Department for Community Development & Religion  (DFCDR) and the National Youth Development Authority (NYDA).
TVI’s coalition efforts and continued engagement with stakeholders through the Local Leadership Collective Action Program (LLCAP) is supported by the Australian Government through the Building Community Engagement Program (BCEP) in Papua New Guinea."

“The land title process is a crucial step towards addressing the issues faced by our people in all our resettlement areas. Once they receive their titles, they will have ownership of the land they are currently living on, and this will bring a sense of security and stability to their lives,” Mano said.
Meantime, Lemeki commended the people for cooperating with the Lands Technical Team to fast track the process of title issuance. He urged the people to make use of their blocks of land for economic benefits.
The people of Clifton/Ah Sing welcomed this significant development, saying it now brings hope and security to their people who have been facing challenges related to land ownership.

Holy Moses deported,18/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5283,,Crime,Trust,Nill,"A foreign national who has been involved in a sophisticated transnational criminal network in Papua New Guinea under multiple names including “Holy Moses” was deported last week to Singapore and onto Dubai.
Mr. Amaechi also known by multiple aliases including ""Holy Moses"" and ""Cedric Sedibe Nduduzie"", was removed from Papua New Guinea on 16 July 2025 escorted to Singapore, where he will transit to Dubai with the assistance of Singaporean Immigration Officials.
Mr. Amaechi is known to be involved in the manufacture and distribution of counterfeit currency and the trafficking of methamphetamines and other hard drugs.
He has been closely linked to organized crime syndicates operating across Asia, Latin America, particularly Mexico, and the Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand.
The Immigration and Citizenship Services Authority confirmed the successful deportation of Remigius Amaechi, following an intensive covert operation led by ICSA's Compliance and Enforcement Division in collaboration with the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary.
His presence and unlawful entry into Papua New Guinea, using fake travel documents, constitute a breach of Chapter 16 of the Migration Act 1978, which warrants immediate action and investigation.
Mr. Amaechi was previously apprehended in 2016 under a false identity for printing counterfeit U.S. currency within PNG and was deported thereafter.
Intelligence-led operations revealed that Mr. Amaechi re-entered PNG illegally through the Wutung land border post from Indonesia on 3 October 2024, using a fraudulently obtained Nigerian passport under a new name.
He was apprehended on 25 February 2025 by the Police Dog Unit and ICSA Enforcement Team after being traced and placed under surveillance.
A forensic examination of his mobile phone uncovered disturbing details of his direct contacts with operatives of drugs syndicate using known foreign established businesses to coordinate shipments of illicit drugs into PNG with confirmed communications with international contacts across Mexico, Thailand, and Australia.
These findings point to Mr. Amaechi's central role in a wider Pacific drug syndicate, using PNG as a transit route for illegal drugs destined for Australia and New Zealand.
""This removal underscores the firm stance of the Papua New Guinea Government and the Immigration & Citizenship Services Authority against transnational crime. We will not allow our sovereign borders to be used as a safe haven, transit route, or operational base for organized criminal networks aided by foreign nationals.
The removal of Holy Moses is a result of close inter-agency collaboration, precise intelligence, and decisive enforcement action.
“I commend the dedication of our officers and reaffirm our commitment to securing Papua New Guinea's border against foreign criminal threats."" Chief Migration Officer Wellington Navasivu said."

The Commissioner's comments follow a number of recent social media posts fraudulently alleging incidents of crime.
""There have been a number of recent posts by known political opportunists who have nothing else to do but talk our country down,"" the Commissioner said. “One matter in particular is the photo of a young expatriate person with a knife impaling their hand. The political activist claimed that this was a violent attack by rascals upon an expatriate in Kimbe. The reality is that this was a fishing accident that happened in another country.”
""Police examined the post and identified details which indicated the photograph was not taken in Papua New Guinea. Following communication with our Pacific policing partners, the incident was confirmed as having occurred more than 2,000km away in another country.
""What was just as encouraging is that members of the public reported the social media posts to police, after forming doubt as to the truth of the post,” he said.
Commissioner Manning said these individuals must accept that they are breaking the law and will be called in for a police interview.
""Intentionally spreading fear or causing public alarm is an offence. In this instance, it is clear that the person responsible for the post acted with malicious intent and they will be held accountable for their actions,” He added."

PNGNA launches Savings & Loans service,17/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5272,,Health,Trust,Nill,"The PNG Nurses Association (PNGNA) yesterday launched its Savings & Loans Society. Six members also received their certificates and signed loan applications. PNGNA S&LS Chief Executive Officer Justeen Pindipi said the essence of the launch is the processing of the loan application.
After the launch, six staff from Port Moresby General Hospital and two from Laloki Psychiatric Hospital, as well as PNG Nurses Association President Freddy Kebai submitted their loan applications. Their accounts were expected to be credited today.
“Now we are online. That’s the keynote part of what we are launching as the Savings & Loans,” Pindipi said.
The maximum loan guaranteed is K20,000 and minimum is K500.
“The loan interest component is one percent as approved by the regulator, the Bank of PNG. You cannot go up, you cannot come down. When you want to go up, we have justified cases, i.e justifiable cases that means we have to go to get increase of 1:2 or ratio of 1:3, 1:5.  We’ll have to seek authority from the regulator,” he added.
The appeal now from the PNG Nurses Association is for the rest of the 4,000 registered nurses to complete the Savings and Loans membership forms to be eligible for a loan.
PNGNA S&LS Chairman and PNG Nurses Association president Freddy Kebai said, “It is really a new dawn in the financial liberation for the nurses in the country. We are trying to liberate them out from their financial burdens, and give them the financial freedom.”
“It is the congress’s decision to establish this PNG Nurses Savings & Loans Society and becoming a member is taking quite a while.
“Funding doesn’t come from the government, nor from the Bank of Papua New Guinea, or even from the Federation’s Savings & Loans society.
“It is from their own pocket that established this entity,” Kebai said.
Mr Kebai appealed to PNGA members to take ownership of this service for financial freedom."

PNG Music Mourns Barike Pioneer Matalau Nakikus,16/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5239,,Culture,Sadness,Nill,"Papua New Guinea is mourning the sudden passing of Matalau Nakikus, a founding member of the legendary Barike Band.
He died on Monday following ongoing health complications.
Nakikus was a pioneering figure in PNG music, best known for helping create the iconic Tolai Rock sound—a powerful blend of traditional Tolai rhythms with reggae and rock.
He co-wrote and performed national hits such as “Wan Kantri”, “Iau Ra Biavi”, and “Rabaul Town.”
Born in Rabaul, Nakikus was also a teacher, lawyer, and cultural advocate who inspired generations of musicians.
Matalau Nakikus was more than a musician—he was the heartbeat of a generation. Through the keys of his keyboard and the strength of his voice, he told the story of a people, a culture, and a country still discovering its identity. With Barike, he didn’t just make music—he made history.
From the warbat beats of Rabaul to the national anthem-like “Wan Kantri”, Nakikus carried the soul of Papua New Guinea in every chord.
He stood proudly at the crossroads of tradition and change—turning pain into poetry, and rhythm into revolution.
His passing has prompted tributes from across the country, including his nephew and award-winning artist Anslom, who described him as a “musical pillar.”
Late Matalau's close friend and pioneer Barike band member Donald Lessy, when spoken by this newsroom yesterday, was lost for words and could only reply, ""I am lost and can't accept this news"".
""Matalau and I through music and Barike became so close even travelled everywhere and internationally.
""He was part of the production of the Wan Kantri song...he didn't actually write the song, but it was his tune we used for Wan Kantri,"" recalls Lessy.
A teacher. A lawyer. A cultural warrior. A proud Tolai son—Matalau Nakikus’s legacy lives on in every PNG artist who dares to blend the old with the new.
Though his voice has fallen silent, his songs will never fade.
He gave us rhythm.
He gave us pride.
He gave us Wan Kantri."

PNG push for full membership in ASEAN,15/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5228,,Diplomacy,Anticipation,Justin Tkatchenko,"Minister for Foreign Affairs Justin Tkatchenko has reiterated PNG’s aspiration to transition from ASEAN Special Observer to full membership, underscoring the strategic and economic value PNG offers to the region.
Tkatchenko, during the 32nd ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Kuala Lumpur on July 11, 2025 said Papua New Guinea’s inclusion would enhance ASEAN’s influence in the Indo-Pacific, particularly amid growing geopolitical tensions and cross-border security challenges.
Minister Tkatchenko emphasized PNG’s readiness to contribute to ASEAN. He highlighted PNG’s potential to strengthen ASEAN–Pacific economic connectivity and people-to-people exchanges.
“PNG’s inclusion would give ASEAN an economic foothold in the Pacific and unlock trade and investment opportunities,” the Minister noted, referencing PNG’s abundant natural resources, including major LNG and crude oil exports, a 2.4 million km² EEZ, and globally significant biodiversity.
He further remarked: “The recent imposition of tariffs by major powers has impacted ASEAN’s economic security. PNG’s vast resource base can offer the bloc a reliable partner for diversification and growth.”
Although PNG has not yet submitted a formal application for full membership, the Department of Foreign Affairs will now prepare a Cabinet Policy Submission for consideration by the National Executive Council.
PNG has maintained ASEAN Special Observer status since 1976 and is a permanent member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), the largest Asia-Pacific political and security forum comprising ASEAN’s 10 member states, 10 Dialogue Partners, and 7 Observers.
PNG has established full diplomatic missions in four ASEAN countries, with a fifth mission to open in Thailand later this year— fulfilling ASEAN’s membership expectations.
Tkatchenko said Papua New Guinea respects the ASEAN process and stands ready to commit fully to its obligations, initiatives, and agreements.
“We offer strategic geography, surplus resources, and steadfast commitment to peace and regional cooperation.”
This renewed bid marks a pivotal step in PNG’s 49-year engagement with ASEAN and its continued role as a bridge between Asia and the Pacific. PNG has participated as an ASEAN Special Observer since 1976 and a permanent ASEAN Regional Forum member since 1994."

The roundtable was organized through close partnership between the National Department of Agriculture and Livestock, the Department of National Planning and Monitoring with the full endorsement of the Office of the Chief Secretary.

“The key challenges and resolutions of the conference is being compiled and will be presented for the Government to collectively review and better understand what we can do together to address these issues and challenges,” said the secretary. “Let us look at our respective mandates and how we can complement the efforts of the Agriculture Sector agencies efforts to build this sector to be the key driver in delivering our key targets in PNG Vision 2050, DSP 2030, MTDP4 and NASP 2033.”
“This is an all of government efforts in building a robust and dynamic agriculture sector that will feature well in meeting our MTDP 4 target of K200 billion by 2030 and deliver the 1 million additional jobs.

Samuel said the meeting marks the formal launch of a new Whole-of-Government Coordination Mechanism to unlock shared solutions to the complex challenges restraining the development of PNG’s agriculture and renewable resource sectors. It will convene leaders in the meeting to identify clear pathways for joint planning, integrated service delivery, and coordinated investment.
“If we act now and together, if we invest with urgency, innovate with purpose, and deliver with accountability, we will: Lift millions out of poverty through agriculture led growth, Make PNG a food secure, export driven Agri powerhouse and ensure no child, no woman, no farmer is left behind.”"

HIV infection rates rapidly increasing,15/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5231,,Health,Sadness,Elias Kapavore,"HIV infection rates in Papua New Guinea have sharply increased in 2025, with new infections doubling since 2010.
Recent data by the UNAIDS shows that about 30 new HIV infections occur daily, totaling approximately 11,000 new cases in 2024 alone.
Nearly half of these new infections are among children and young people aged 24 and below, highlighting a growing impact on younger populations.
A critical concern is the high rate of mother-to-child transmission, with an estimated 2,700 infants newly infected in 2024 due to many mothers being unaware of their HIV status and thus not receiving antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
This situation has led the government to declare a national HIV crisis in June 2025.
“The rise in new HIV infections in PNG is deeply concerning. As such, I am declaring this a National HIV crisis,” said Minister for Health Elias Kapavore.
“HIV is a disease of inequality. We need to support and empower those most impacted. It is time for all of us to step up. I commit to raising this issue with my fellow ministers and parliamentarians and ensuring the urgent allocation of resources to protect our people, especially the next generation of Papua New Guineans.”
These trends indicate a worsening epidemic that requires urgent scale-up of HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services, especially targeting mothers, children, and adolescents.
As of 2025, the global number of people living with HIV is estimated at around 40.8 million, including about 2.42 million children and adolescents under 19 years old.
In 2024 alone, approximately 1.3 million people were newly infected with HIV worldwide.
Regionally, Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most affected, with countries like South Africa having about 9.4 million HIV-positive people and an adult prevalence rate of 14.4% in 2025.
Other countries with high adult prevalence rates include Eswatini (28.3%), Lesotho (26.2%), Botswana (22.8%), and Zimbabwe (22.1%).
Globally, despite progress, challenges remain with approximately 712 children infected daily and 250 children dying from AIDS-related causes in 2024. The global target for 2025 is to reduce AIDS-related deaths to fewer than 250,000 annually."
New autonomy committee in ENB,15/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5233,,Politics,Anticipation,"James Marape, Leo Dion","A new Autonomy Advisory Committee for East New Britain Province was sworn in yesterday (July 14) in Kokopo by the provincial legal officer.
Comprising nine members and chaired by former politician, Sir Leo Dion, the new committee replaces the last committee that was headed by another former senior statesman, the late Sir Sinai Brown.
The new ENB Autonomy Advisory Committee comprises of;
•	Chairman – Chief Leo Dion
•	Ex-Officio – Marakan Uvano (Deputy PA for Socio-Economic Sector)
•	Kokopo representative – Dr. Livingston Tavul
•	Rabaul representative – Nelson Kiene
•	Gazelle representative – Joe Endo
•	Pomio representative – Patrick Kaupun
•	Baining representative – Chief James Tapele
•	NGO representative – Patrick Varagat
•	Women’s representative – Fidelma Kinakap
ENB Provincial Administrator Levi Mano said the previous committee’s term had also expired and new members were appointed last year, but they could not be sworn in, given it was approaching the end of the year.
Hence, the swearing-in program was deferred to this year, but unfortunately, the former chairman, Sir Sinai, also passed away in late March.
He said that while a lot of groundwork has been done by the previous committees, this new committee should progress on what East New Britain needs in its pursuit of autonomous or more decentralised powers from the national government.
“We were also fortunate to have Sir John Kaputin here in the province to give an insight on how we see autonomy, from both a development and legal point of view,” he said.
Also present at the ceremony was the ENB Provincial Member, Michael Marum, who acknowledged the efforts and leadership of the former committee members and chairpersons over the years.
He further applauded the political leadership that pursued the autonomy request by the provincial government, in the likes of former governor Chief Leo Dion, who is now the committee’s chairman.
“I want to also thank Prime Minister James Marape for his support. He has assured me personally of his government’s stand on East New Britain’s autonomy agenda,” Marum outlined.
Newly sworn in committee chairman, Chief Leo Dion, said autonomy is the right for the province to manage its affairs, as well as taking charge of the type of development that is meaningful to the province.
Chief Leo emphasised that true autonomy thrives where there is unity.
“Whether you are Tolai, Baining, Pomio, Sulka or visitor who has made this land your home, this province belongs to all of us. Our diversity is our strength, and our differences are threads in the beautiful bilum of East New Britain,” he stated.
“Let us carry the hopes of our ancestors and the dreams of our children in our hearts.”"
Suspect in officer’s brutal killing in custody,15/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5236,,Crime,Sadness,Ginson Saonu,"A suspect involved in the brutal killing of a police reservist in Finschhafen was brought into Lae yesterday by Morobe police.
The young police reservist, from Finschhafen, succumbed to his injury early this month when he was slashed on the head by another local man in the district.
The deceased was one of the first batch of enthusiastic officers that had graduated under the Morobe reserve police program in 2021.
While police are establishing facts into the incident, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) for Northern Command, Peter Guiness, said they believe the suspect is a person with a substance use disorder.
“The suspect was picked up and brought in yesterday along with other murder suspects in other cases in Finschhafen,” ACP Guinness said.
“They are now in custody.
“I will be following up with the Provincial Police Commander to check. At the moment, they are too busy; they’re engaged in the Kabwum by-election.”
The deceased was a young constable who was one of the 100 police reservists who had passed out from the Gusap Regional Training Centre in Madang Province, in 2021. This was under a partnership between the Morobe Provincial Government and Royal PNG Constabulary, during the term of former governor, Ginson Saonu.
The aim of the reservist program was to boost police presence in Morobe’s rural districts; hence reservists were sent to their respective electorates after concluding their training.
The reason behind his killing is yet to be determined, with ACP Guinness saying his body will be brought to Lae as well.
“Post-mortem will be conducted here in Lae and eventually, after the post-mortem is done, the body will be repatriated to his village in Finschhafen for burial.”
ACP Guinness said the suspect will be charged with wilful murder."
Volunteer promotes conservation of ‘Oro Butterfly’,14/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5220,,Environment,Anticipation,Nill,"Found only in Northern province, the Queen Alexandra Birdwing butterfly (Ornithoptera alexandrae) is as rare as it is breathtaking.
With wings stretching nearly a foot wide, this beautiful species is in serious trouble, facing habitat destruction and illegal trade.
To mitigate this, Ahi, a volunteer attached to the National Volunteer Service (NVS), is on a journey to accelerate its conservation at the global stage.
“The Queen Alexandra Birdwing Butterfly is the largest species of butterfly in the world and it is only found in Papua New Guinea. I fear we may lose this national treasure in the next decade if we do not take good care of it,” says Ahi.
Through his Dun Eco-Tourism Project submission, he has been shortlisted as one of the top 10 finalists in the ClimateLaunchpad National competition amongst nine other inspiring Papua New Guineans with their climate-focused ideas.
Ahi entered the competition specifically focused on conserving the Queen Alexandra's Birdwing butterfly through securing a partnership and is one of 10 finalists who were selected out of 100-plus candidates around the country.
“My mission is to raise awareness on the Queen Alexandra Birdwing Butterfly and PNG’s unique biodiversity, build networks and meaningful partnerships with like-minded people and promote volunteerism at the Global stage,” he said.
Ahi said that habitat loss due to deforestation and agriculture, illegal collection, and climate change has pushed the species towards an uncertain future.
Ahi was initially assigned to the Dun Eco-Tourism project in Yoivi village in Ward 1 of the Afore LLG in the Ijivitari District of Oro by NVS in 2023.
His task was to rehabilitate and foster the growth of eco-tourism in the area and to promote the conservation of the Queen Alexander Birdwing Butterfly.
He has since been passionately working towards safeguarding the species by building a nursery to breed this butterfly and a conservation site where tourists and others can go to see this butterfly.
Ahi has also built a one-kilometer road with the help of the community to link this remote site to the main highway so that more people are made aware and protect the butterfly.
“This competition might seem like a routine event to many, but for me and the 2,000-plus people of Yoivi village, it means everything as it represents hope, visibility, and a long-awaited chance to tell our story of preserving the Oro butterfly on a global platform,” he said.
In addition, Ahi said that there has also been an increase in illegal butterfly collectors in the province who are eager to claim a specimen for export making it dangerous for the species to thrive and calls on the relevant authorities to look into this so the species is protected for future generations.
The National Competition grand finale, organised by the Em Stret Space will be in August and will see three finalists out of the 10 to represent Papua New Guinea in the ClimateLaunchpad’s Global Grand Final event in Vienna, Austria.
The passionate volunteer at the helm of this crucial attempt at preserving the largest butterfly in the world says that he is confident that the Oro Butterfly just might get the future it deserves."

Gov’t commits to achieving balanced national budget by 2027,14/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5211,,Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has reiterated the government’s firm commitment to achieving a balanced national budget by 2027.
Marape made this known when meeting with senior executives of the IMF at the IMF headquarters in Washington DC, USA, recently.
He said that from 2028, PNG will embark on an aggressive debt repayment path, anchored by the implementation of the Sovereign Wealth Fund, which is expected to be fully operational by that time.
“If we stick to our fiscal consolidation path, eliminate wastage, and grow our revenue base, we will be in a position to repay our debts and reduce our debt-to-GDP ratio to sustainable levels—targeting 30 percent or lower,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
He highlighted that by 2033, the government aims to eliminate all public debt accumulated since Independence in 1975, marking a historic milestone for the country.
According to IMF projections shared during the meeting, Papua New Guinea’s economy is expected to grow by 4.7 percent in 2025, a rate higher than the global average (3.7 percent) and outperforming the majority of Pacific Island Forum and ASEAN economies.
The IMF attributed this growth to prudent fiscal management, the recovery of non-resource sectors, and consistent reform momentum.
Prime Minister Marape noted that the country has experienced four consecutive years of non-resource sector growth—driven by agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and small-scale enterprise—proving that the economy is beginning to diversify beyond extractive industries.
“For the first time in our post-Independence history, we are seeing consistent growth from sectors that benefit our rural population. This is no accident—it is the result of targeted investment and reform,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister also pitched new areas of IMF technical assistance, including support for:
-	Establishing AI-driven digital platforms for public procurement and public service recruitment, aimed at strengthening transparency and merit-based selection;
-	Expanding renewable energy generation through hydro, geothermal and solar technologies;
-	Utilising domestically available natural gas to power island provinces and supply neighbouring Pacific nations;
-	Strengthening the country’s capacity to manage its Sovereign Wealth Fund transparently and effectively.
“These initiatives will not only help us modernise government, but also attract private investment and ensure efficient delivery of public services,” he said."

For most of us that come from the Australian Awards Scholarships, we have had an issue with finding inclusive workspaces, now this project, we see that it's a dream come true for people with disability,” said Ruth Javati, Vice President, PNG Assembly of Disabled Persons.
The initiative will be delivered in collaboration with the PNG Assembly of Disabled Persons, the Business Council of PNG, and the Lae Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
EmployAbility will address the significant underrepresentation of people living with disabilities in PNG’s workforce. The initiative will develop and rollout an EmployAbility Toolkit which draws on real-life PNG case studies to provide businesses with practical advice on accommodating and empowering people living with disabilities as employees and customers.
It will also deliver work-readiness training, placement opportunities, and networking events designed to connect people with disabilities directly with employers — challenging bias and creating real employment pathways.
Ms Carmella Gabina, Executive Director, Business Council of PNG, said: “We believe in promoting inclusivity in the workplace is essential. For a strong and more vibrant community, we need to build workplaces where everyone can contribute their skills and ideas. This benefits not only businesses but also helps to create a fairer and more equal society.”
Also in attendance was Australian High Commission representative, Sinead Mulders-Jones.
“Many people living with disabilities face barriers to economic participation, including lack of accessibility and inclusive hiring practices. Employability aims to support PNG businesses create inclusive and more accessible workplaces for people living with disabilities in PNG,” she said.
Inclusive development is a shared priority for both the Australian and Papua New Guinean governments. EmployAbility represents a step forward in ensuring that people living with disabilities have equal access to employment opportunities and can contribute meaningfully to PNG’s economic growth."
Landau to lead high-level US delegation to Golden Jubilee Celebrations,12/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5193,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"The United States will send a high-level delegation to Papua New Guinea to attend the 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations in September, led by the Deputy Secretary of State, Christopher Landau.
Prime Minister James Marape announced this following his meeting with Landau on Wednesday, July 10th 2025.
The Prime Minister also met with the Vice President of the United States on Thursday, July 11th at the White House where the Vice President confirmed USA’s attendance to the 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations.
Prime Minister Marape’s meeting with US government officials has strengthened strategic ties between Papua New Guinea and the United States across trade, investments, security, and fisheries cooperation.
His engagements included high-level discussions at the Pentagon, U.S. Border Protection, and the U.S. Coast Guard, meeting with the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, Christopher Landau and meeting with the Vice President.
Prime Minister Marape described these discussions as highly productive.
The Prime Minister also welcomed the continued presence of major American companies in PNG — Newmont, ExxonMobil, and Hilton — and encouraged further U.S. investment in fisheries, energy, hospitality, and manufacturing.
He specifically advocated for U.S. involvement in the fisheries sector, including through regional partnerships facilitated by the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and the East New Britain Initiative, which offers land for joint Pacific fisheries ventures.
On deep sea mining, Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed PNG’s national moratorium on this sector, highlighting the importance of the waters as breeding grounds for marine life.
In the area of defence cooperation and maritime security, the Prime Minister acknowledged the growing benefits of the existing Defence Cooperation Agreement.
He said defence cooperation is not only strengthening the military’s capacity but also improving operational readiness, infrastructure, and surveillance across the board, noting an increase in military-to-military exchanges, joint operations, and training initiatives under the agreement.
Discussions with the U.S. Coast Guard and Pentagon officials focused on enhancing joint maritime patrols to counter illegal fishing, transnational crime, and illicit trade — including unauthorised shipments of arms, drugs, and other contraband."
Manning participates in Pacific Commissioner’ Fitness Challenge,12/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5194,,Public Service,Trust,Nill,"PNG Police Commissioner David Manning in completing the Pacific Commissioner’s Fitness Challenge, also issued a directive for RPNGC personnel to improve their fitness levels befitting the standards expected to do their jobs.
The Commissioner took time out to train with Kumul23 personnel to complete the Pacific Commissioner’s Fitness Challenge, issued by his counterpart, Geoff Turner, the police commissioner of Tonga.
At the completion of this challenge, Commissioner Manning passed on the challenge to the Police Commissioner of Vanuatu.
Manning pointed out to the member’s of RPNGC the public’s expectation of their fitness levels.
“The public expect their police to be fit for duty and that is my expectation of our men and women in uniform,” Commissioner Manning stated.
“Police work is physically and mentally demanding. We must be on top of our game.
“Witnessing our recent graduation of more than 200 police constables, I was proud to see the highest physical standards. These young constables are professionals and remind us of the importance of physical discipline.
“The best members we have on the force are those who are committed to serving our people and protecting lives and properties and this is the RPNGC we are developing.”
Commissioner Manning said he made a decision to improve his personal fitness and is leading by example.
“We all put on a few kilos as we get older but that is something we can manage through discipline, exercise and sensible choices.
“A disciplined approach to physical fitness benefits our members professionally and personally.
“New standards for physical fitness will be introduced that will set levels required for our police to meet.
“Personnel that are part of the Kumul23 tactical group must attain a peak standard of physical fitness and mental agility.
“Kumul23 sets a high level and this is a very good example for other police around the nation to aspire to in their jobs.”"
Menyamya’s five brave students,12/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5195,,Education,Sadness,Nill,"Five students from Morobe’s rural Menyamya Secondary School bravely held their heads up as they marched alongside 13 other high and secondary schools into the Lae Showgrounds on Thursday.
Fourteen marching groups – representing the 14 participating schools – paraded into the Lae Showgrounds on the day to officially open the 2025 Morobe Inter-school Exhibition.
While 13 of the schools had nearly 20 or more students marching proudly with their well-designed banners and marching attires, Morobe’s rural Menyamya Secondary School only had five students – three male and two female students.
Dressed in their green and black uniforms, it was obvious that the group was hastily put together for the morning parade.
Grade 12 line 1 student, Brenden Gipion, found himself pushed to the front when their teachers decided to put all their efforts on the science display.
While he was disappointed with not only his teachers but their student leaders as well, he decided to lead the small group of marchers into the arena, hastily instructing them on simple patterns while marching.
Fellow marcher, Grade 10 student, Jodie Johnamjie, who is part Central and Menyamya, burst into tears as she told of how they had travelled for six hours to finally reach their host school, Busu secondary, at 4am.
After only a few hours of rest, they had to get ready and move to the Lae Showgrounds for the parade then exhibition.
“Because of the delay by the vehicle, the students who are supposed to march to open the exhibition are still on their way,” she said.
“The teachers asked some of the students to participate in marching and for some of us, we didn’t even practice marching and everything but they picked 10 of us but the students did not want to participate and they just left.
“For five of us, we would love to leave because last night, we did not have a good night’s rest because we were traveling till morning. And now we are down here and because of our school’s name, we had to stay here without eating properly,” she sobbed.
“It really helps a lot to see Menyamya secondary taking part in marching. For us students, we are happy because we would love to see our school’s name on the list also.
“We will do anything for our school, even if we are tired or hungry, even we are stressed out but, we still have to do it because of our school.”
Twelve teachers had reportedly travelled down with the first group of Menyamya Secondary School students.
The students rarely travel down to Lae city, and though they were sorely disappointed – and even entertained the thought of returning home immediately, Jodie, said they will use this experience as a stepping stone."
WNBPG Renews Health Commitment,12/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5197,,Health,Trust,Sasindran Muthuvel,"The West New Britain Provincial Government has reaffirmed its commitment to delivering quality healthcare to its rural population with a financial boost to one of its key health partners.
This week, Governor Sasindran Muthuvel presented a K200,000 grant to Australian Doctors International (ADI) during a ceremony in Kimbe, underscoring a continued partnership that began in 2019.
The funding, drawn from the Provincial Services Improvement Program (PSIP), will support ADI’s mobile outreach patrols and training of frontline health workers.
“On behalf of WNBPG, it’s our pleasure to present this K200,000 cheque to support their activities in going to rural areas in treating our people and bringing this health service to our people,” said Governor Muthuvel. “We will continue to partner with them going forward to bring much-needed health services to our rural area.”
Last year, ADI’s outreach clinics covered over 155 days in Talasea and Kandrian-Gloucester, reaching more than 20,000 people. The funding will also enhance training programs for community health workers and nurses.
Melis Paita of the WNB Provincial Health Authority (PHA) welcomed the support, stating, “We are pleased that most of our mothers and children are being taken care of and we will make sure that acquittals are provided on time.”
ADI representative Elizabeth Mesa highlighted the importance of joint planning and implementation:
“It will allow us to provide additional trainings to our frontline health workers. Our work is not done in isolation – it’s done shoulder to shoulder with local help, staff, community leaders and the PHA.”
The tripartite collaboration between WNBPG, ADI, and the PHA continues to strengthen rural health service delivery and community well-being."

NAC announces airport capacity for A220s,11/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5185,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"With the arrival of the first of All Air Niugini's new Airbus A220 fleet in September 2025, the National Airports Corporation (NAC) advises that five out of its 13 designated jet airports are currently capable of supporting the regular unrestricted operations of the new A220 and the B737 aircraft. The Albus (Airbus) A220, which has a maximum take-off weight of up to 70 tonnes, requires a runway length of approximately 1800 to 2500 metres for take-off at maximum weight, depending on altitude and weather conditions.
The airports that can accommodate the A220 when it commences operations are those with asphalt concrete surfaces. They are, Port Moresby, Nadzab, Kavieng, Momote, and Gurney.
Passenger safety
According to NAC Acting Managing Director/CEO Dominic Kaumu, the reasons precluding the operations of the A220 and the B737 into the above eight airports, include safety perspective, given that these aircraft have low slung engine under the wings and there is a high risk that the engines can easily ingest loose sealing chips from bituminous spray sealed surface and damage the jet engines.
Kaumu said the other reason is that the Fokker 100, the current operating aircraft, has a maximum take-off weight of 44 tonnes, and the bituminous spray-sealed surface has been holding up to its operations. On the other hand, the A220 with a maximum take-off weight of 70 tonnes, which is an additional 30 tonnes pressed on the pavement and with the aircraft maneuvering on its bituminous spray seated surface can cause the pavement protective seal to break exposing the pavement to nature and undermine the pavement integrity hence accelerate the rate of pavement deterioration.
He said for the safety of the aircraft and the passengers, it is essential that the runways be surfaced with asphalt concrete as opposed to the bitumirious spray sealed surface of the above airports. The asphalt concrete overlay on our runway pavements will also extend the life of the pavement by an additional 15 to 20 years, resulting in lesser cyclic maintenance costs for the runways, as the most important asset at any airport.
Asphalt concrete surfacing
Other jet airports will not accommodate the A220 in 2025 until their aircraft pavements are surfaced with asphalt concrete. These airports are Mt. Hagen, Tokua, Vanimo, Buka, Goroka, Hoskins, Wewak and Madang.
The A220 and the 8737 cannot operate into Mt. Hagen and Tokua airports until the asphalt concrete surfacing is placed at the former and a second layer of asphalt concrete is placed at the latter. A second wearing course of asphalt concrete must be placed at Tokua airport as a medium-term arrangement whilst the NAC gets a major upgrade of the aircraft pavement under the Civil Aviation Development Program (CADIP) 3, which is anticipated to commence in 2028.
Mt Hagen and Tokua airports need K40million each to lay the asphalt concrete to enable operations of the A220 and 8737. Tender for the work at Mt. Hagen has been completed and is awaiting funding of K40million to implement. Mr Kaumu said NAC is ready to call for tender for the second layer of the asphalt concrete at Takua but is again subject to the availability of another K40million funding.
The NAC boss said it is important to note that preparedness of airport operations for a major re-fleeting program, such as the new Airbus A220, requires early engagement with all key stakeholders to ensure that airport capacity, regulatory compliance are ensured and infrastructure compatibility are aligned with the aircraft's performance, safety requirements, and schedules."
17 arrested over sorcery-related murders,11/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5180,,Crime,Disgust,Nill,"Seventeen suspects have been arrested over the murder of four elderly men accused of killing 15 people through sorcery in May 2025 at Veraibari village in East Kikori, Gulf province.
Provincial Police Commander (PPC) Chief Inspector Jefferey Lemb said the suspects were arrested by the Kikori police, and are awaiting legal process to be formalized before they can be transported to Kerema police station.
PPC Lembi confirmed that the suspects' ages range between 25 and 51. All are from Veraibari village and believed to be relatives and family members of the 15 people who died.
“Police went into Veraibari village and communicated with the community leaders and brought in the suspects,” the PPC said. “All suspects including the community leaders were transported to the Kikori police station on six police dinghies.”
“One Forensic officer and two Criminal Investigation Division personnel are already on the ground processing the 17 suspects before they are brought to Kerema police station. More suspects are expected to be arrested soon as well.
“I will be seeking assistance from the Police Headquarters to move all suspects and escort party by air to Kerema due to the bad weather and very rough, violent waters between Kikori and Kerema,” PPC Lembi said.
He said the police throughout Papua New Guinea (PNG) are well aware of the increase in sorcery-related killings, and they are doing their best to arrest suspects with whatever resources they have. Hence the PPC is grateful for the support of community leaders in bringing in the suspects"
Manning calls for immediate intervention in Hela,11/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5182,,Crime,Anger,Nill,"Commissioner of Police, David Manning, has expressed outrage at recent instances of violence against women in Hela Province and has directed immediate police intervention to protect vulnerable communities.
""These disgusting crimes against women and children have shocked the nation,"" Commissioner Manning said.
""These are not the actions of Papua New Guineans; these are the actions of animals.
""Murder, rape, and torture will not be accepted as 'cultural beliefs.' These are crimes, plain and simple.
""The notion of 'sanguma' was not known to our nation 50 years ago, and it will not be accepted today. Nonsense excuses for crimes must end.
""With immediate effect, I have directed Deputy Commissioner for Regional Operations, Samson Kua to establish a police intervention and personally oversee operations in Hela province.
""DCP Kua's directions are to restore order, dismantle groups that perpetuate so-called 'cultural beliefs' that fuel misery and death, and ensure swift justice for offenders.""
In confirming the implementation of a targeted intervention, Commissioner Manning noted that communities must do more to protect the vulnerable.
""Lasting change requires community action. Elders and leaders must step in—not stand by—when their own are being brutalized. It's time to intervene, support police, and protect our people.
""Standing around recording violence on phones and posting it online is cowardice. Leadership means stepping up to stop it.
""With the support of the government, this intervention will clamp down hard on violent offenders. The women and children of Hela deserve safety, dignity, and justice, and this police intervention will deliver.""
Commissioner Manning called on all government agencies to support the intervention, highlighting that protecting the vulnerable is a societal responsibility.
""The situation in Hela is an emergency and immediate action is required. I have committed the resources of the RPNGC to support DCP Kua end this lawlessness, and I expect all Government agencies to step up to end this cycle of violence against the most vulnerable,"" Manning added"
Minister upset over students' inappropriate behaviour,11/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5184,,Education,Disgust,Lucas Dekena,"The Minister for Education, Lucas Dekena has condemned the inappropriate and culturally insensitive activities recently displayed by students of Gerehu Secondary School during their Mufti Day program held on Friday July 4, 2025.
The program, organised by the Student Representative Council (SRC) and supported by the school administration, was held under the theme PNG@50: Honouring Our Pacific Heritage, inspiring Modern Careers, and Celebrating Sports Outfits Innovation.
Minister Dekena said while we recognise that schools often host programs to help students showcase various professions and aspects of our culture, there must be clear limits, including respecting the norms, values, and expectations of our communities.
Dekena said what unfolded during the school’s Mufti Day program was well beyond what is acceptable. Images of what the minister described as inappropriate behaviour, was circulated on social media stirring negative comment from members of the public. The minister said this behaviour reflects very poorly on the school, its administration, and the education system as a whole.
“School principals should be very sensitive to any activity that students are going to take part in, activities that will promote negative perceptions, or incite trouble.”
“Even if teachers believe these activities are part of educational programs, principals and administrators must ensure that students do not cross boundaries that could incite unethical conduct or damage the reputation of the school.”
“The principal and school administration have already provided a full explanation on what has transpired. Their performance will be reviewed, and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken where necessary.”
“Going forward, I urge all school principals and administrators to exercise greater care and sensitivity when it comes to activities as such. Any activities that might promote negative perceptions or offend cultural and community standards must not be allowed in our schools.”
“Our schools must always uphold the highest moral and ethical standards. This is essential to (protecting) the image of our institutions and to safeguard the future of our young people,” the Minister added."

Barras Trials Heat Up,11/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5189,,Sports,Anticipation,Nill,"Papua New Guinea’s top cricketers went head-to-head at Amini Park yesterday in a crucial 50-over trial match, as selectors prepare to name the final 14-man squad for two major international tournaments later this year.
The match, held under clear skies in Port Moresby, brought together the 25-member Barramundis train-on squad, who have spent the past two months in intense preparation for the 2025 ODI tournament in Jersey and the ICC T20 World Cup Qualifiers in Oman.
Chairman of the National Selection Panel, Hudson Api Leka, described the match as “compelling” and praised the high level of competition between veterans and new talent.
“New and vibrant players challenged the old guard, proving that every position in the squad is up for grabs,” said Leka. “This is exactly what we want—it keeps everyone sharp and ensures only the best wear the national colours.”
The squad will next be trimmed to 20 contracted players before selectors finalize the 14 who will represent PNG in the two global tournaments and form the backbone of the national team going forward.
National Assistant Coach John Ovia credited much of the team’s progress to international coaching input, particularly from former Australian national coach Tim Nielsen.
“Tim has been instrumental in sharpening our batting and bowling techniques,” Ovia said. “Combined with support from international fielding coaches, our players have responded well, and the improvement is visible.”
The squad features a mix of experienced Barramundis—such as captain Assad Vala, Sese Bau, Kabua Morea, and Alei Nao—and promising new additions, including Under-19 Garamuts who recently competed at the U19 World Cup Qualifiers in Japan.
“It’s encouraging to see senior players mentoring the younger ones. That bond is shaping a resilient and united squad,” Ovia added.
He also acknowledged Cricket PNG’s support for providing resources, uniforms, and logistical backing, helping the players focus solely on performance.
With selectors now reviewing player data and performances from today’s match, the final squad is expected to be announced in the coming days.
As PNG’s cricket community awaits the announcement, one thing is clear:
competition is fierce, preparations are strong, and the Barramundis are determined to make their mark on the global stage.
“This is a defining moment for PNG Cricket,” Leka concluded. “Let’s continue to back our players as they fight for every opportunity and aim to bring pride to our country.”"
PNGDF launch 50th walk,11/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5186,,Military,Anticipation,Michael Somare,"To begin its celebration of Papua New Guinea's 50th Independence Anniversary, the PNG Defence Force (PNGDF) will stage Exercise Antap Long Ol, beginning in the second week of July and leading into the PNGDF Week in September.
This will involve PNGDF land element units of the army participating in a walk, traversing the country from its mainland's northern seaboard to its southern seaboard. It will begin at the 2nd Battalion Royal Pacific Island Regiment base in Moem and conclude in Waigani, Port Moresby.
East Sepik Deputy Governor David Kausik officially launched the program on Wednesday, July 09th at Moem Barracks.
This activity will retrace the steps of 2nd Battalion Pacific Island Regiment soldiers in 1975 who undertook the first Exercise Antap Long Ol when then Lieutenant Geoff Key led a patrol of 16 men across 1,200 kilometres from Moem to Port Moresby, and delivered two letters of greetings to then Chief Minister Michael Somare and then Minister for Defence, Foreign Relations and Trade Albert Maori Kiki.
Therefore, in the next two months, soldiers will walk over 1200km from the North to the South of mainland PNG. Soldiers in Wewak will walk to Madang and hand over to soldiers in Lae, who will walk to Markham Bridge and hand over to our Port Moresby and Central Province-based units to cross over the mountain ranges between Morobe, Gulf, and Central to reach Port Moresby.
Chief of Defence Force Rear Admiral Philip Polewara said it will be a difficult and treacherous walk. The soldiers will cross two of our largest rivers - the Sepik River and the Ramu River – and cross large plains in the Sepik, Ramu, and Markham, and they will go over the dangerous Ekuti Dividing Range to reach the Gulf and NCD.
“It will be a challenging activity, a test of character, endurance, and resilience, but the men and women of the PNGDF will complete this exercise,” Polewara said.
Kausik said the walk signifies the PNGDF's readiness to showcase the resilience, strength, determination, and bravery of the force 50 years on in safeguarding the people of PNG."
Digital Boost for Simbu School of Nursing,10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5170,,Education,Trust,Nill,"The Kundiawa School of Nursing has taken a major step into the digital era with the commissioning of its first Information Communication Technology (ICT) laboratory, making it the first tertiary institution in the Highlands region to receive such support under the National Information and Communication Technology Authority (NICTA) digital inclusion initiative.
The lab, officially opened yesterday (July 9) at the school’s Mirene campus, includes 20 brand new desktop computers and a fully installed Wi-Fi and internet system, all funded and implemented by NICTA.
Highlands Regional ICT Inspector for NICTA, Antonia Karai, confirmed that while the ICT rollout has been ongoing in other regions, Simbu is now leading the way in the Highlands.
“It is a costly investment, but NICTA is committed to bridging the digital divide, especially in rural and remote tertiary institutions,” Karai said.
Principal of the Kundiawa School of Nursing, Ali Mun, expressed gratitude, noting that as a recently established institution, development milestones like this are vital.
“In today’s world, students must be digitally equipped. With NICTA’s support, we’re not just building infrastructure — we’re building opportunities,” Mun said.
The lab is in line with national education directives that all higher education institutions be ICT-enabled, ensuring students gain the necessary skills for a technology-driven workforce. The school has also undertaken other developments including new classrooms and staff housing.
With this support, the school is positioning itself not just as a centre for nursing education but also as a model for rural digital transformation."
Colourful student parade opens exhibition,10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5175,,Education,Joy,Nill,"In Lae, it’s not an event worth mentioning if the iconic Bugandi brass band is not performing.
Under clear skies, neatly dressed students from 14 different high and secondary schools in Morobe proudly flew their banners as they marched in time to the beating drums of Bugandi’s brass band.
The schools around Lae city, Huon Gulf district, Bulolo and even rural Menyamya – with only five students representing the latter – paraded into the Lae Showgrounds and demonstrated their marching patterns as their peers enthusiastically cheered them on from the side.  The parade signifies the official opening of two days of interschool exhibition under the theme: ‘Creativity, Innovation and Unity in Education in Morobe’.
“Fourteen schools, two private schools also included; AOG Christian Academy and Christian Integrated School,” outlined Busu Secondary School principal and the exhibition’s coordinator, George Noble.
“Also, our school of excellence for Morobe Province, Wawin School of Excellence.
“Compared to the previous years, the number of items has really increased; the number of schools has also increased, and number of participants has also increased. Because of that, we cannot have one stage to put everything in order. We have three different stages.”
When the exhibition was first hosted in 2019, Noble said most schools did not know what to do or what was expected of them. The second and third exhibitions were hosted in 2022 and 2023 as the COVID-19 pandemic had prevented large gatherings in 2020 and 2021.
Last year, the action committee could not host an exhibition due to funding constraints. This year, K200,000 from the Morobe Provincial Government has made the event possible, with Noble expressing his delight that this year, the marching has improved.
“More than 10,000 students and 375 teachers we are accommodating here in the main arena now,” continued Noble.
“This K200,000 – K100,000 from last year, and another K100,000 this year – put together, we organised this program.
“Compared to previous years, we gave a little bit more money as financial assistance to all the schools.
“Our dear deputy provincial administrator, Robin Bazzinuc, as we can see from the number of students, this K200,000 is not actually enough to host this program properly, including the prizes and awards. I’m kindly asking you to increase the amount to K385,000 or something.”

Lae team tours Australian vessel,10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5167,,International,Trust,Nill,"A team from Lae, Morobe Province, were taken on an official tour of the Australian Defence Vessel (ADV) “Reliant”.
The Australian Consulate-General in Lae, Morobe Province, invited some of its partners aboard ADV “Reliant” yesterday (July 9) to learn of the vessel’s capabilities when it comes to assisting in disasters or humanitarian response efforts in the region.
Representatives from the Royal PNG Constabulary, PNG Fire Service, Morobe Provincial Health Authority, the provincial disaster office and church partners were welcomed on board by Navy liaison officer, Lieutenant Commander Paul Newton.
Lt Commander Newton explained that ADV ‘Reliant’ is not commissioned, hence it is not part of the Navy’s active fleet. Instead, ADV ‘Reliant’ “is the Australian Government’s primary maritime humanitarian and disaster response capability”.
“We have been tasked by the Australian Government purely to provide support to south-west Pacific nations,” explained Lt Commander Newton.
“This ship is assigned for 300 days a year to support south-west Pacific taskings; the other 60 days will be spent doing maintenance.
“So, it’s a very high priority for the Australian Government to provide a persistent presence out here and importantly, the work that the ship does should be driven from our Pacific Island partners.
“So, you work very closely with Sir (Australian Consul-General Brenton Kanowski) from the post, and has the request go up and filtered down. Hopefully, when we come out, we provide direct support to what Pacific Island nations need as opposed to what we might think you might need. There’s a slight difference there.”
The vessel’s recent task was the ferrying of the historic US bomber, Hell’n Pelican II, to Port Moresby to be placed in the PNG National Museum and Art Gallery.
ADV ‘Reliant’ is currently ferrying back army vehicles and equipment used in ‘Exercise Pukpuk’ at Igam Barracks. The vessel also provides maritime surveillance, search and rescue, training, mentoring and capacity building in an effort to contribute to a collective secure region.
The auxiliary vessel has medical facilities and the ability to produce approximately 20 tonnes of potable (drinking) water per day, with storage for up to 800 tonnes of drinking water and offloading capacity of 500 tonnes per day. It has two saltwater cannons to fight fire, 60 bunks and a 1,000 square metre deck that can fit up to 500 people for a 12-hour transit.
Australian Consul in Lae, Brenton Kanowski, welcomed the ship’s arrival, outlining that its visit highlights the strength of Australia’s partnership with Papua New Guinea, and their shared commitment to regional security and resilience."
"Simbu crackdown on cheap, harmful liquor",10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5168,,Health,Trust,Noah Kool,"The Simbu Provincial Administration has intensified its crackdown on cheap, high-alcohol-content spirits across the province, despite lifting its liquor ban last month.
Effective June 3, 2025, the Simbu Provincial Executive Council, chaired by Noah Kool and Provincial Administrator John Punde, restructured the previous total ban by continuing to outlaw cheap spirits, especially those over 5 per cent alcohol and mostly imported from Asian markets.
“These products like Mr. Ethen, Wanbel, Dark Rum, and Coffee Punch are too strong, too cheap, and accessible to our young people,” said Acting Principal Advisor for Revenue, Wagi Kon. “They are a key cause of public disorder in our towns.”
“We are not allowing spirits like Mr. Ethen, Wanbel, Dark Rum, and others that are harmful. Our concern is the youths—these drinks are cheap, strong, and dangerous.”
Operations led by the Revenue Division began last week and is continuing this week in the urban centres before expanding to all six districts. The Liquor Division is working closely with police to ensure compliance.
Liquor Inspector, Johnny Kaupa said enforcement is strict, “Our inspections are ongoing. We are warning shop owners not to stock banned items. Penalties will apply for non-compliance.”
Only certified alcohol products such as SP Brewery beer and other legally imported beverages from Australia, New Zealand, and Europe are permitted for sale.
The province cites rising youth alcohol abuse as a leading cause of lawlessness, with many school-aged children involved in alcohol-fueled violence and disturbances.
The Simbu Administration urges parents and community leaders to support the crackdown to protect their children and restore peace in the province."
Kumul Joins Global Spotlight,10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5171,,Environment,Trust,Nill,"Papua New Guinea’s iconic Raggiana bird-of-paradise, or kumul, has become the 17,000th species featured in National Geographic’s Photo Ark, a global initiative dedicated to documenting animals in human care to promote biodiversity and conservation.
This milestone was achieved during a visit to the Port Moresby Nature Park in April 2025 by National Geographic explorer and Photo Ark founder Joel Sartore. His mission is to photograph 25,000 species worldwide to inspire greater public awareness of the planet’s fragile ecosystems and the need to protect them.
“Birds-of-paradise are truly living works of art, with their stunning colors and mesmerizing behavior,” Sartore said. “We preserve art in museums — don’t these birds and the species we’ve captured deserve our protection too?”
The Photo Ark’s announcement was shared with a global audience of more than 500 million through National Geographic’s and Sartore’s social media and media channels, placing a bright spotlight on PNG’s remarkable biodiversity.
The fact that the kumul—the national symbol of Papua New Guinea—was chosen as the 17,000th species holds special significance. The milestone also aligns with the country’s 50th year of independence, adding further national pride to the achievement.
“To have our national bird recognized as the 17,000th species in this globally respected project, and during our golden jubilee year, is truly the icing on the cake,” said Johnpaul Houston, CEO of Port Moresby Nature Park. “It highlights the uniqueness of our wildlife and the importance of protecting it for future generations.”
Many of the animals photographed during Sartore’s visit had never been documented in the Photo Ark before, making PNG a major contributor to the project’s growing archive.
The photographs will be returned to the Port Moresby Nature Park later this year for public display, giving locals and tourists alike the chance to see the beauty of PNG’s wildlife through a global lens.
As forests shrink and species face growing threats from human activity, the inclusion of the kumul in this global conservation archive sends a clear message: protecting PNG’s natural heritage is more urgent than ever."
Kimbe Port Redevelopment Underway,10/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5173,,Development,Anticipation,Nill,"The Kimbe Port Redevelopment Project in West New Britain has officially entered the mobilisation phase, with two barges carrying critical plant and equipment departing from Townsville, Australia earlier this week. The equipment, which will arrive in approximately 12 days, will enable the start of major maritime works at the port site.
The redevelopment is a key component of the Australian-funded Ports Infrastructure Investment Program (PIIP), through the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP).
The PIIP aims to upgrade five strategic ports across Papua New Guinea—Kimbe, Oro Bay, Daru, Kavieng, and Lae—to enhance trade, connectivity, and economic resilience.
Pacific Marine Group Pty Ltd (PMG) has been contracted to deliver the complex marine works under a PGK260 million contract. This includes demolishing and rebuilding the main wharf, restoring the existing wharf structure, and repairing revetment walls. Works are scheduled to conclude in 2026.
The project is expected to provide substantial economic benefits to the local community through employment, training, and subcontracting opportunities for Papua New Guinean firms.
In the coming months, local construction company Global Constructions Ltd will begin shore-based works under a separate PGK79 million contract.
The initiative arrives just ahead of PNG’s 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations in September and highlights the enduring partnership between Papua New Guinea and Australia.
It also signals a major step forward in improving the country’s maritime infrastructure and unlocking greater access to trade and development in West New Britain."

This progress was achieved during a high-level visit to PNG between 8 and 10 July that took place in a Team Europe format: bringing together the representatives of the EU, its lending arm, the European Investment Bank (EIB), and the French development agency (AFD).
European Commissioner for International Partnerships Jozef Síkela said, “From transforming the Rabaul port into Papua New Guinea’s first green port to improving access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene, the partnership between the European Union and Papua New Guinea is delivering real impact — boosting trade, jobs, health, and climate resilience. These flagship initiatives reflect the EU’s Global Gateway investment strategy in action, driving sustainable economic growth and improving lives for communities in the country. I look forward to my visit to the Pacific region in September to strengthen our mutual cooperation.”
“We are proud to support the Government of Papua New Guinea and work alongside our European partners to deliver sustainable infrastructure that makes a real difference to people’s lives. Whether it is building rural bridges, modernising ports, or improving access to clean water, these are the kinds of projects the European Investment Bank is committed to under the Global Gateway. We value our cooperation with Papua New Guinea and look forward to continuing to invest in a greener, more resilient future for the country,” said Ambroise Fayolle, EIB Vice President.
The two key initiatives in PNG are the modernisation and greening of the Rabaul Port.
On Wednesday 9 July 2025, PNG Ports Corporation Limited (PNG Ports), AFD, EIB and the EU discussed the status of the project that seeks to upgrade and green the Rabaul Port. The project highlights the strong European commitment to modernising PNG’s port infrastructure to meet growing trade demands and address environmental challenges. The project is part of Global Gateway to support the development of sustainable quality infrastructure (energy transition, waste management, climate and disaster proofing). It is delivered in a Team Europe approach, bringing together the EU, AFD and EIB.
“PNG Ports is committed to upgrade its port facilities to be fit for purpose, sustainable and climate and disaster resilient, and this support and collaboration with AFD, EU, and EIB will greatly assist in realising this,” said Mr Papenfus.
In addition, he mentioned the project being aligned with the PNG Government’s push for the implementation of green initiatives and more resilience to the global effects of climate change at the ports.
EU Ambassador, Jacques Fradin said, “The Rabaul Port Rehabilitation Project, with an EU grant of EUR 16.6 million, is the first action in PNG where an EU grant is combined with EU guaranteed loans provided by our European partners AFD and EIB, in order to advance the EU Global Gateway Strategy in PNG and the Pacific.”
Furthermore, on Tuesday 8 July 2025, the national government and the EU signed an agreement for a new EUR 3 million project. It will provide capacity building and support to Water PNG Limited to improve access to safe, reliable water and reduce water loss for communities. This agreement is an addition to a wider cooperation package totaling EUR 39.7 million between the Government, the EU and EIB.
The project will help Water PNG deliver safe, affordable, and sustainable water services in Namatanai (New Ireland Province), Kupiano (Central Province), Misima (Milne Bay Province), and Kurumul (Jiwaka Province), while also supporting water loss reduction in selected areas of Port Moresby.  The signing took place in Port Moresby and was witnessed by Heads of relevant national and provincial government agencies, as well as Heads of missions and development partners.
The visit by the Deputy Director General for International Partnerships at the European Commission, Myriam Ferran, and the EIB Vice-President, Ambroise Fayolle, included high-level discussions with Deputy Prime Minister John Russo, Minister of Treasury, Ian Ling-Stuckey, Minister of Works and Highways Solan Mirisim and Minister for National Planning Sir Ano Pala."

Call for tougher penalties against PMV operators,9/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5159,,Politics,Anger,Powes Parkop,"NCD Governor, Powes Parkop, has condemned the mayhem and destruction caused by Public Motor Vehicle (PMV) drivers and their relatives in Port Moresby on Tuesday, July 8.
He said the actions of the individuals involved in the riot in Hanuabada have not only undermined law and order but have also tarnished the city’s image.
Governor Parkop has appealed to the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Benjamin Turi, and the Metropolitan Superintendent, Warrick Simatab, to immediately identify and arrest all PMV drivers and individuals involved in the riots, and have them charged for riotous behaviour and other relevant offences.
He also called on the Road Traffic Authority (RTA) to suspend the operating licences of all PMVs involved indefinitely, and also a review RTA’s role in managing public transport in Port Moresby.
Parkop added that the authority has failed to effectively regulate the sector.
“There is no place for such lawlessness in our capital city, especially in this day and age when we are striving to build a modern, peaceful, and progressive society.
“While I share the public’s grief and outrage over the tragic killing of a PMV crew member – a crime that must be thoroughly investigated and justice delivered – it does not in any way justify the reckless and tribal violence that followed.”
Governor Parkop said this incident that transpired at Hanuabada must be a turning point.
“We must urgently detribalise the public transport system in our city. The culture of tribal identity and revenge has no place in our public services. I call on the Minister for Transport to make the bold and necessary decisions to reform the system. We cannot allow such irresponsibility to continue unchecked,” said Parkop.
“What occurred yesterday (Tuesday) was a complete breakdown of decency and order. It must never happen again. We must act swiftly and decisively to restore confidence in public safety and to uphold the rule of law in our capital city,” added Parkop."

The match against the Central Queensland Capras in Rockhampton, Queensland, promises to be an emotional and pivotal moment for Alu and the team.
At 30 years of age, Alu has already carved a legacy with the Hunters since making his debut against Northern Pride on March 17, 2018, under the guidance of foundation coach Michael Marum. Elevated from the ranks of the Rabaul Gurias, Alu's commitment has made him one of the longest-serving members of the Hunters squad.
Following last week’s impressive victory over competition leaders, Townsville Blackhawks, where the Hunters triumphed 34-16, Alu is filled with enthusiasm for this milestone game.
Expressing his excitement, Alu commented, “It’s been a journey to get to 100; it hasn’t completely sunk in yet, but it’s a privilege and an honor to play 100 games for this wonderful club.”
Despite the significance of the occasion, he emphasizes the importance of focusing on the team's preparation. “Not thinking too far ahead while all concentration is making sure all our preparation is right and the game can take care of itself.”
Having recently led his team through challenging times, including three consecutive losses, Alu commended his teammates for their resilience in securing a crucial victory against Townsville.
“Big moments like that are a testament to the hard work, commitment, and dedication of the team.” With this newfound momentum, he highlights the importance of the upcoming game in Rockhampton. “This is a very important game for us.”
In reflecting on his rugby league journey and the influences that shaped him, Alu revealed that one of his ultimate goals has always been to represent the Papua New Guinea Kumuls. This dream became a reality in 2024 when he was selected to compete in the Pacific Championships against Fiji and the Cook Islands.
“The biggest goal was to play for the Kumuls. I thank God for the privilege and honor to don the national colors last season,” he said. He also expressed gratitude to his family, his wife, mentor Nelson Stone, and everyone who contributed to his journey.
As Alu approaches his 100th game, he embodies the spirit of resilience, passion, and commitment that defines the PNG Hunters and inspires future generations of athletes."
Hanuabada situation under control,9/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5157,,Local,Anger,Nill,"Following the incident at Hanuabada village on Tuesday, July 8, normalcy has been restored.
However, PMV operators have ceased operations within the area, following the stabbing of a PMV driver. They have demanded for the apprehension of the suspect, before any bus service can continue.
According to police report, the incident began when a PMV bus driver was stabbed in the eye by a youth from Tatana village, following a verbal altercation over a parking space at the Hanuabada bypass bus stop.
This incident led to a disruption of public transport services as other PMV bus drivers, feeling aggrieved, took matters into their own hands. They mobilized and confronted residents of Hanuabada village, and also intimidated other law-abiding PMV drivers, forcing them to cease operations. This left innocent commuters, including mothers, girls, schoolchildren, and the working class, stranded at bus stops.
NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab condemns the actions of those PMV drivers who chose to take the law into their own hands and disrupt essential public services.
""While we understand their frustration, such actions are unacceptable and only cause further hardship for the very public they serve, stated the Superintendent. ""Our priority is always the safety and well-being of our citizens, and to see innocent people suffer due to these actions is deeply concerning.""
Simatab confirmed that the injured bus driver is not deceased and is receiving medical attention. Furthermore, the suspect in the stabbing has been identified as a youth from Tatana village. Police are actively working with community leaders to ensure the suspect surrenders peacefully to face justice.
The NCD Metropolitan Superintendent assures the public that police have taken swift action and have the incident under control, “We have engaged with the aggrieved bus drivers and assured them of their security concerns, urging them to resume normal PMV services immediately. The general public and other PMV buses should not be held to ransom or subjected to intimidation.”
“Police presence in the affected areas has been increased to ensure public safety and the smooth resumption of transport services. We appeal to all citizens to remain calm and cooperate with the authorities. Justice will be served, and those responsible for both the stabbing and the subsequent unlawful disruptions will be held accountable,” Simatab added.
Meanwhile, police have informed all PMV operators to let the rule of law take its course continue to provide transport service, effective Thursday July 10th."
Strengthen early warning systems,8/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5137,,Weather,Anticipation,Nill,"The National Weather Service has emphasised the urgency of investing in early warning systems, which are the first line of defence against disasters.
Director of the National Weather Service (NWS), Jimmy Gamoga, said at the opening of the National Partnership and Coordination Session on Early Warning Systems (EWS) in Port Moresby today.
Papua New Guinea continues to face increasing threats from natural hazards and climate-induced disasters such as landslides, floods, and droughts. Recent events, including the Mulitaka landslide in Enga Province and flooding in East Sepik, Western, and Morobe provinces, highlight the urgent need for robust early warning systems—especially in remote areas with limited access to timely alerts.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM), brought together a diverse group of stakeholders, including government agencies, United Nations agencies, telecommunications and media organisations, and development partners, to explore ways to strengthen people-centred early warning systems across Papua New Guinea.
The IOM in collaboration with the PNG NWS, and with financial support from the Government of Japan, hosted a National Partnership and Coordination Session on Early Warning Systems (EWS) in Port Moresby.
Through the Early Warning System Scale-Up in the Pacific Project, IOM is working to enhance disaster preparedness and resilience in Papua New Guinea, Fiji, and Vanuatu. This initiative, funded by the Government of Japan, aims to empower communities with timely, actionable information to reduce disaster risks.
IOM Chief of Mission, David Arnold, reaffirmed IOM’s commitment, stating, “This initiative is part of our broader commitment to anticipate disasters and empower communities with timely, actionable information—especially in remote areas where the risks are greatest.”
Key components of IOM’s EWS scale-up efforts include:

Legislative training to upskill CLRC staff,8/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5136,,Government,Trust,Nill,"The Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) has commenced a week-long Legislative Drafting Training for its officers, a key initiative to bolster its mandate on law review and reform recently.
The training was organized by CLRC’s HR to cater to important drafting skills required by lawyers and researchers to do their jobs.

The training will ensure officers confidently understand the role of law in the development of the country, understand the important role that lawyers play in society in influencing development, and the special role of a legal draftsperson.
Delving into the first session of the training, officers were provided with case studies and recent legislative amendments to enable discussions on steps in effective legislative drafting and actual drafting of law.

Makiba condemns brutal killing in Magarima,8/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5140,,Local,Anger,Manasseh Makiba,"Member for Magarima and Minister for Bougainville Affairs, Manasseh Makiba, has condemned the recent torture and brutal killing of a woman in Magarima District, Hela Province, following accusations of sorcery allegedly linked to her husband’s death.
In a statement, MP Makiba expressed shock and sorrow, describing the incident as “inhumane, shameful, and a stain on the conscience of our society.”
“Such horrific acts have not been seen in Magarima for many years. It is deeply disturbing and utterly unacceptable that innocent, defenseless women—often widows or single mothers—continue to be targeted by baseless accusations of sorcery,” he said.
Makiba reminded the public that the Sorcery Act of 1971 was repealed in July 2013, following nationwide outcry and increasing cases of violence. Under the revised Criminal Code Act (Section 299A), any intentional killing related to sorcery accusations is classified as willful murder—a serious criminal offense.
“Justice must be pursued through lawful and constitutional means—not mob violence,” Minister Makiba stated. “The world is watching, and Papua New Guinea cannot afford to be a nation where violence masquerades as justice.”
The Minister confirmed that Provincial MP for Hela, Philip Undialu has also denounced the killing in the strongest terms and has called for immediate arrest and prosecution of those responsible.
Accordingly, Minister Makiba has instructed the Hela Provincial Police Commander, Superintendent Michael Welly, to launch an immediate investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice without delay.
“I have directed all community leaders, ward councillors, and LLG presidents across Magarima District to cooperate fully with the police. This includes both regular and reserve officers stationed in the district,” he added.
Minister Makiba emphasized that communities must not remain silent or passive. He called on citizens to become the first line of defense against such atrocities by standing with law enforcement, rejecting violence, and protecting the vulnerable.
“It is a sad day for Hela. But we must rise from this tragedy with a renewed commitment to uphold the rule of law, protect human life, and end the tragic cycle of sorcery accusation-related violence,” Minister Makiba concluded."
ICAC Acting Members sworn in,8/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5146,,Government,Trust,Bob Dadae,"Three acting members of the Commission for the Independent Commission Against Corruption were sworn in at the Government House today.

Eluh was sworn in as Acting Commissioner, Justice Batari, and retired judge Don Sawong were sworn in as Acting Deputy Commissioners.
They were sworn in by the Governor General, Sir Bob Dadae, and witnessed by the members of ICAC, family, and friends.
Acting Commissioner Eluh acknowledged the ICAC's appointment committee for the confidence in appointing them.
He said they step into these roles during a time of considerable public scrutiny and operational sensitivity. As is publicly known, the substantive Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners have been suspended from office, pending formal investigations. These matters are being handled according to the rule of law and to ensure the integrity of due processes.
“However, let me state this clearly, ICAC is greater than any individual. It is a national institution built on constitutional authority and public trust.
“It has taken many years and many challenges for Papua New Guinea to reach this point. The road to establishing ICAC was long and difficult, marked by doubt and institutional resistance. But the demand from our people for real action against corruption has never faded. It was this collective voice that led to the creation of ICAC under Section 2208 of the Constitution, supported by the Organic Law on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (OLICAC) 2020,” Eluh said.
Justice Batari and Retired Judge Sawong bring exceptional legal experience and judicial integrity to their roles as Acting Deputy Commissioners.
Eluh said their contributions will be essential as they work together to maintain institutional stability and continuity across all operational areas.
“I want to reassure the public that the ICAC remains fully operational. Our investigations, prevention programs, and institutional responsibilities are continuing without disruption. We are committed to maintaining internal stability, safeguarding the integrity of our systems, and ensuring effective and transparent communication with the public and stakeholders,” he added"

Supported by Australia’s Transport Sector Support Program Phase 3 (TSSP3), these contracts aim to upgrade critical sections of the national highway network, particularly in the West New Britain and Madang provinces.
In West New Britain, Jay LW Contractors Limited has been awarded an almost K10 million contract for pavement rehabilitation and resealing works on a 24-kilometre section of the New Britain Highway between Balaha Box Culvert and Tiauru Bridge Number One.

The works will target critical sections and bridge approaches from Airport Junction to Surumarang Bridge, ensuring continued connectivity between the provincial capital and surrounding districts.
DoWH Secretary Gibson Holemba welcomed the contract signings.
“These investments demonstrate the Department’s commitment to delivering safe, reliable and climate-resilient infrastructure through open and competitive national procurement systems,” Secretary Holemba said.
“With strong support from our development partner Australia, we are also building capacity within local contracting and supervision services. This is key to sustaining transport infrastructure across PNG,” he added.
Dr Cate Rogers, Minister Counsellor Infrastructure, Australian High Commission, reaffirmed Australia’s support for local content and PNG leadership.
“Australia is proud to support infrastructure delivery that improves roads, builds PNG’s national systems and strengthens local industry. Prioritising local content, skills and suppliers is central to the way we work together.”
As Papua New Guinea marks 50 years of independence, these works reflect the enduring development partnership between PNG and Australia.
TSSP3 continues to support DoWH to rehabilitate roads, strengthen bridges, assess climate risks and foster institutional reform for a more effective, efficient and inclusive transport system for all Papua New Guineans.
The improvements in road access are expected to facilitate better connectivity for local communities and businesses, ultimately boosting economic activity in these regions."

ENB acknowledges LLG election deferral,7/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5111,,Politics,Neutral,Nill,"East New Britain Province has acknoweldged the deferral of Local Level Government elections by the PNG Electoral Commission.
Provincial Administrator and chairman of the Provincial Election Advisory Committee (PEAC), Levi Mano, outlined that the province received a circular from the PNG Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai, via the Provincial Electoral Commission office in Kokopo.
The change will see polling moved back by two months; from July 12th to September 27th.
This will also affect the date for the return of writs, which has been deferred from the 22nd of August to the 17th of November, 2025.
“I would like to assure the PNGEC and the people of East New Britain Province, that we will be adhering to this circular and the proposed changes in the dates for polling,” said Mano.
“In saying that, we as a province are ready to conduct polling in the province, as we have been preparing for the conduct of the LLG Elections since last year, 2024.
“The PEAC is a key partner to the PNGEC in the rollout of the LLG elections over the years, and stands by to support the completion of the election process in the province.
“Despite the delay now in polling, this also gives ample time for candidates to do their campaigns, and likewise the PEAC to finalise preparations for polling in all the 23 local level governments.”
Mano outlined that the reasons stated for the deferral of polling include:
•	The conduct of several elections at the same time, which includes five national by-elections, the Motu-Koita Assembly elections and the LLG elections in the country, that is inclusive of 12 provinces that are voting for both Ward Members and LLG presidents;
•	The proclamation and late notifications of new wards and LLGs in parts of the country;
•	Administrative irregularities that require resolution from the Department of Provincial and Local-level Government Affairs (DPLGA); and
•	Funding and procurement delays, which remain a critical challenge for the PNGEC.
“The above reasons do not affect us, but as a province, we will go by the directives given to us, to defer the polling to the new dates that have been set,” continued the PA.
“We continue to encourage a peaceful extended campaign period for our candidates contesting in this year’s LLG elections, while we continue to ensure our preparations are on par before the 180,000 plus eligible voters in the province, go to the polls come September this year.”"
PM condemns torture of woman accused of sorcery,7/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5115,,National,Anger,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has expressed profound sorrow and outrage in response to the brutal torture and murder of a woman in Hela Province, an act reportedly driven by unfounded accusations of sorcery.
This tragic event, which took place over the weekend in a remote area of the Highlands, has not only shocked the local community but has also reverberated throughout the nation, eliciting widespread condemnation from leaders, civil society organizations, and international observers.
Marape in a statement highlighted the need for a collective stand against violence and superstitious beliefs that lead to such heinous acts.
“I firstly offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of the woman whose life was so cruelly taken,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“This is a heartbreaking and shameful act. In this day and age, there is no justification—cultural, traditional, or emotional—for such violence. It is murder, and it will be treated as such.”
He called for an urgent investigation into the incident and urged law enforcement authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice.
Thanks to the swift response by local authorities and the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, eight suspects were arrested shortly after the incident.
The arrests were made possible through coordination between the Provincial Police Commander (PPC), community leaders, church groups, and provincial leaders.
The Prime Minister also emphasized the importance of education and awareness campaigns to combat the underlying beliefs that perpetuate violence against women, particularly in cases of alleged sorcery.
The incident has reignited debates around gender-based violence and human rights in Papua New Guinea, with many advocating for stronger protections and interventions for vulnerable populations.
Community leaders and activists have joined the call for an end to mob justice and vigilantism, stressing the need to uphold the rule of law and respect for human rights in all situations.
As the nation grapples with the implications of this tragedy, calls for reform and healing within communities are paramount, with an emphasis on fostering a culture of respect, truth, and justice."
Court dismisses allegations against City Manager,7/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5117,,Law,Disgust,Nill,"The Waigani District Court has dismissed allegations of Abuse of Office and Conspiracy against NCD City Manager Ravu Frank, due to abuse of process.
Magistrate Paul Puri Nii made this ruling stating that proper process of proceeding with this matter was not followed by the complainant.
Nii said the complaint alleged that the defendant, as the city manager, abused his powers and conspired with others to terminate him as an employee of the National Capital District Commission (NCDC) over a land issue. However, Magistrate Nii said the complainant did not follow the right process to sue the city manager for these allegations.
“(The) complainant alleged that the defendant was involved in illegal proceedings to take away his land, so he cannot connect his termination from employment to fraud or other illegal damage. These allegations should be processed on their own,” Nii said. “Illegal land use and fraud are distinct criminal matters that should not be connected with the unlawful termination of employment.”
“What the complainant should have done was to arrest the defendant for forgery or conspiracy without mentioning unlawful termination of employment to the police because this is an abuse of process.
“In my view, an employer has the power to hire and fire his or her subordinates, citing reasons associated with their conduct; this is a normal operation of an organisation.
“The appropriate process is that the complainant should have written to the defendant to review his decision to terminate or seek advice, or give notice to NCDC under section 4 of the NCDC Act and sue for damages for breach of contract or for reinstatement, which the complainant did not do.
“The initiative taken by the complainant by referring the defendant to the police for his employment termination with NCDC for the allegations of forgery and obtaining land is not proper, and it is an abuse of office.
“The criminal court does not deal with employers terminating employees. I believe the judicial review court might be the appropriate court,” Nii added.
Meanwhile, it was before the court that Frank, 54, of Alewai Village in Rigo Central Province, was alleged to have ordered the human resource office to suspend an enforcement coordinator from the NCDC, claiming that his employment contract had expired.
The coordinator, Mathias Repo, was issued a suspension letter on October 4th, 2023, and subsequently terminated. Repo filed a police report, stating that his contract at that time ran from July 1, 2021, to July 31st, 2024, and that his employment was therefore still valid. He added that he had been with the commission for more than 16 years and had never faced any disciplinary charges.
Police allege that Frank conspired with others at NCDC to remove Repo in order to take ownership of a piece of land at Korobosea that the complainant had obtained through a PNG Lands Board tender, nine years ago."
Digicel ExxonMobil Cup Resumes,7/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5118,,Sports,Surprise,Nill,"After a bye last week, the Digicel ExxonMobil Cup resumed over the weekend with exciting rugby league action. The round featured standout performances, including a surprise win by the WNB Kimbe Cutters over PRK Gulf Isou at home, while the Agmark Gurias defeated the Lae Snax Tigers.
The PRK Mendi Muruks continued its fine form beating the NPL Enga Mioks 26 - 22 at Sir John Amban Oval in Minj, Jiwaka.
The Muruks ran six tries over the Mioks line in a remarkable display of attacking prowess, but struggled with conversions. Kumul Kaupa converted only one goal from six attempts. The Mioks scored four tries of their own but it was not enough to topple the competition leaders.

The double header in Port Moresby brought some surprises. The NCDC Moni Plus Port Moresby Vipers ran riot over Gas Resources Central Dabaris 26 - 4. The Vipers walked home with two competition points but it spells a lot for the Dabaris as they return to drawing board.
In the later match, the WNB Kimbe Cutters out-muscled PRK Gulf Isou 30 - 18 in a well-deserved win. The Isou has been the most improved team over the last two months but couldn't go past the Cutters who wanted it more in that game.
In Rabaul's Queen Elizabeth Park, the home side Agmark Gurias welcomed visiting Lae Snax Tigers in a hostile reception. Gurias crossed over for 6 tries and Derrick Voku stared in the game with two tries effort. Tigers on the other hand bagged only two and were outplayed by the host team.
The final game of the round on Sunday saw Bintangor Goroka Lahanis host Asila Waghi Tumbe at the National Sports Institute in Goroka. The Lahanis narrowly escaped with a close win 22 – 20.

Eight surrender over sorcery-related killing,7/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5121,,Crime,Anger,Manasseh Makiba,"Eight suspects are in police custody, including the individual who allegedly pulled the trigger in the sorcery-related torture and murder of a woman in Magarima, Hela Province.
Hela Provincial Police Commander (PPC), Superintendent Michael Welly said the suspects surrendered yesterday (Sunday 06th July 2025) with the assistance of local leaders, Margarima District CEO, and police personnel who facilitated the voluntary surrender.
PPC Welly said the act was condemned by leaders as both criminal and barbaric, prompting the immediate launch of a police-led manhunt supported by provincial and community leaders.
Hela Governor Philip Undialu and Minister for Bougainville Affairs and Magarima MP Manasseh Makiba visited Magarima on Friday, 04th July, and formally launched the operation to apprehend the suspects.
They appealed for community cooperation and a peaceful surrender of those involved.
“Police units deployed from Tari conducted coordinated arrests of the eight suspects. The suspects were transported to Tari Police Station for formal processing.
“Additional suspects have been identified where some individuals are believed to be from Biango Village, Kandep District, Enga Province, and require cross-border cooperation with Enga police,” PPC Welly said.
PPC Welly said the success of this operation underscores the importance of proactive leadership and strong community-police collaboration. He said Hela Province continues to demonstrate that justice is achievable when leaders on the ground work with law enforcement.
Superintendent Welly said the direct involvement of Governor Undialu and Minister Makiba, coupled with decisive police action, sends a strong message that sorcery-related violence in the province will not be tolerated.
PPC Welly said the sorcery-related killings are fully prosecutable. The Sorcery Act was repealed in 2013, making it clear that sorcery-related accusations do not justify violence. Offenders are subjected to charges including murder, torture, and unlawful confinement, with potential penalties of life imprisonment.
Police investigation continues with more arrests expected to be made."

Waiembi joined the Hunters recently from Central Queensland Caprass, though player exchange, and will come off the bench in the number 17 jumper.
PNG Hunters coach Paul Aiton said Waiembi will add value to the team as he has proved a handy player in the competition.
Aiton said, “He’s hard to stop. He’s a really powerful player, and we are lucky enough to have players that can add attack, but there is attack and defence as well.”
The Hunters have assembled a strong side ahead of their clash today.

Adding an attaching flair to PNG Hunters outfit is the inclusion of livewire five-eighth in Gairo Voro.
The young five-eighth became a talking point within the rugby league community the last fortnight after he was sensationally axed from the team. He returns on the bench in number 24 jumper and will have a point to prove on Sunday.
In another notable change to the team, halfback Jamie Mavoko has lost his position to Joshua Lau, who's starting at halfback for the first time in over six months. Since coming from nasty knee injury, Lau started off . After losing three consecutive matches, Aiton’s men are aiming for positive outcome on home turf.
The Hunters coach is urging the rugby league community in Port Moresby to support them on Sunday as they take on the Blackhawks."
EHP community sign conservation deed,5/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5105,,Conservation,Trust,Nill,"The Yasina Community Conservation Area in Ward 7 of the Upper Bena Local Level Government (LLG), Eastern Highlands Province, has committed to conserve and protect their forests and animals by signing a conservation deed, which will formalise their land-use management plan.
The name ""Yasina"" refers to a prized local orchid native to the area. Initially, the area was referred to as the Yasina Nature Park, reflecting the significance of this native orchid and the natural environment. Community residents were thrilled to have achieved this milestone and renamed the area Yasina Community Conservation Area.
The conservation deed covers five clans (the Semeya Nagai, Ekesa Gegiya, Gakuhu Nagai, Migotahi, and Gosi Nagai clans) with a combined estimated population of over 500 people and covering a total of 2,307 ha of customary land that lies in the eastern part of the Bismarck Forest Corridor.
The signing signified the clans’ commitment to protecting their natural resources and creating a thriving, sustainable environment where biodiversity is preserved, cultural traditions are respected, and community livelihoods are improved.
Chairman of the Yasina Community Conservation Area, Paul Pake, said “the signing of this conservation deed will enable the people to protect their land and resources and allow them to take ownership and responsibility of their actions towards their land and resources.”
The Community Relations Manager for the Wildlife Conservation Society in Papua New Guinea, Bennie Atigini, stated that “the signing of the conservation deed will help the community members in managing and protecting their land, including its flora and fauna”.
He further explained that the Yasina Land Use Management Plan serves as a strategic guide to the conservation deed and will help communities make informed decisions about how to use and manage their land and natural resources sustainably, while protecting this important ecosystem, cultural values and biodiversity. Both the deed and the plan will also help communities attract external support and partnerships for long-term environmental and social benefits.
This community is the second in Eastern Highlands Province to sign a conservation deed to formalise the management of their customary land and to conserve the local environment.
The rules for the management area were decided by the residents of Yasina and collectively cover three different land-use zones.
1.	Zone 1 (1, 465 ha) encompasses a restricted area where no human activities or settlements are allowed.
2.	Zone 2 (358 ha) is a buffer area where some activities can be conducted following the rules defined in the management plan.
3.	Zone 3 (484 ha) is for general use and settlement by residents.
The development of the land-use planning process was supported by the Sustainable Wildlife Management (SWM) Programme since 2022, funded by the European Union, and implemented in PNG by the Wildlife Conservation Society.  WCS has assisted six communities in the PNG Highlands to prepare and sign respective conservation deeds, with the Yasina conservation deed being the most recent.
The six conservation areas are:

PM Marape highlights shared values on US Independence Day,4/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5094,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Fourth of July is US Independence Day and Prime Minister James Marape has extended warm congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, the U.S. Government, and the American people on their 249th Independence Day, celebrating the enduring values of liberty, democracy, and faith.
Prime Minister Marape is currently in St. Louis, Missouri, attending the 62nd General Conference Session of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
He has been invited to deliver remarks highlighting “PNG for Christ 2024,” a national Christian outreach initiative, and reflecting on the significance of the day, Prime Minister Marape praised the United States as “the world’s greatest free market economy, the greatest democracy, and the greatest Christian nation.”
“As we mark the 249th birthday of the United States, we also reflect on the rejuvenation of Christianity and the global evangelisation of the Christian message,” he said.
“The United States stands as a beacon of freedom, faith, and opportunity — a country built on timeless values that allow every person to become the best version of themselves.”
He said the symbolic timing of the event — a major religious gathering held on the American Independence Day — served as a powerful reminder of the importance of religious liberty and freedom of conscience, principles also enshrined in Papua New Guinea’s founding law.
“Our Constitution, especially Section 43, upholds religious liberty and embraces freedom of conscience in its entirety,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Just like the United States, Papua New Guinea is a land of great diversity — not from migration, but founded on our rich indigenous heritage. We, too, cherish freedom, faith, and unity in diversity.”
He commended the nearly two-and-a-half centuries of American nation building and noted how the U.S. model of democracy, free enterprise, and religious tolerance continues to inspire countries around the world, including Papua New Guinea.

TIPNG Chairman, Peter Aitsi made this call following reports of administrative issues within the ICAC and is calling for the constitutional basis for the ICAC’s functions to investigate, arrest and prosecute corrupt conduct in PNG to be protected and not fall to political control.
“From the information emerging, the issues affecting the organisation could be tussle for power amongst the leadership of the ICAC, and seem largely administrative in nature. Papua New Guineans are justifiably right to be disappointed as we expected a greater degree of professionalism and better conduct from senior people who were appointed to a publicly-funded entity such as ICAC. They were all senior and experienced individuals who should have been able to resolve these issues among themselves, rather than impacting the operations of the institution under their care,” said Mr Aitsi.
He further said, “In light of the circumstances it is important to remember that the fundamental objective of all concerned citizens is to ensure ICAC is free of political influence. While the individual office holders might have issues, the integrity and independence of the office and its mandate must be upheld for the protection of all Papua New Guineans.”
Aitsi also stated that from reports received, the ICAC Appointments Committee has considered the findings received from the internal government investigation team and have made their decision in order to maintain stability of ICAC.
This include the suspension of the incumbent commissioners and to appoint interim commissioners pending further investigations.
“TIPNG remains ready to support and ensure ICAC is able to fully take up its responsibilities and deliver the results our public is demanding,” said Mr. Aitsi.
The interim commissioners will be required to provide leadership and direction during this period, and it is hoped they will reinforce proper governance and provide further support to the ICAC oversight committee as they are appointed.
TIPNG urges Government to assess and firmly establish the findings from their internal review team and move to conclude this matter with urgency."

It marks the third grant the Foundation has provided to the organization since 2019.
This funding will support the construction of a new cottage for women and children affected by HIV and gender-based violence.
A groundbreaking ceremony at the iCare4U Center celebrated not only the beginning of the new facility but also the Foundation’s continued investment in grassroots initiatives to restore dignity, foster inclusion, and empower women across Papua New Guinea.
The Chairman and members of the Digicel Pacific Board attended the event while they were in Port Moresby for their board meeting, engaging with community members to better understand the challenges faced by survivors and to recognize the center’s holistic approach, addressing not only medical needs but also stigma, discrimination, mental health, and reintegration into society.
Since the inception of Digicel PNG Foundation, it has been a catalyst for change, funding community-led initiatives that tackle critical social issues. Through its Community Grants Program, the Foundation has supported hundreds of local organizations in delivering sustainable, high-impact projects in health, education, and social development.
“We believe in the power of local organizations to drive meaningful change,” said Valda Kereu, Acting CEO of the Digicel PNG Foundation.
“Our ongoing partnership with iCare4U reflects our shared vision of creating safe, inclusive spaces where women and children can heal, grow, and thrive.”
The 2025 grant will fund the construction of a second cottage to meet the increasing demand for safe accommodation. Many women and girls seeking refuge at iCare4U have been rejected by their families and face ongoing stigma. The new facility will provide a secure, supportive environment where they can access care, rebuild their lives, and prepare for reintegration into society.
This initiative is part of the Foundation’s broader strategy to combat gender-based violence, promote gender equity, and strengthen community resilience. By investing in infrastructure and services that directly impact women’s lives, the Foundation is contributing to a more just and compassionate society. “Every grant we award is an investment in hope,” said Valda Kereu.
“We are proud to stand alongside organizations like iCare4U that are doing the hard work on the ground to uplift and transform lives.”
iCare4U founders George and Crystal Nita expressed their gratitude to the Digicel PNG Foundation. “We are deeply thankful for this opportunity to build a dedicated cottage to support women and children,” said George.
The Digicel PNG Foundation is committed to empowering communities through strategic partnerships, sustainable development, and to playing a part to help to ensure that every Papua New Guinean can live with dignity and purpose."

Foreign national arrested for drug trafficking offences,3/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5075,,Crime,Trust,Nill,"Police Commissioner, David Manning, has commended Port Moresby police for the capture of a foreign national in Port Moresby who is being charged with significant drug trafficking offences.
Commissioner Manning further announced that a Police Task Force targeting Illegal drug syndicates has been established under the command of Deputy Commissioner of Specialist Operations, Donald Yamasombi.
""A 45-year-old male from New South Wales was captured by police at the North Waigani Universal Lodge overnight, and it is alleged the male was in possession of 60 kilograms of cocaine,” Commissioner Manning said.
""Police tracked and arrested the man without incident, and now he is facing decades in PNG prison.
""This is another warning to anyone thinking they can get away with trafficking drugs through our country.
""Drug criminals continue to be caught in PNG, and when they move drugs across borders.
""The arrest last night adds to the list of criminals who have been caught transporting or facilitating the movement of drugs over recent years.
""The individual will be refused bail and held pending his trial for this serious criminal offense.""
Commissioner Manning said the threat posed by illegal drugs is a matter of national importance, and police operations continue to be stepped up.
""The Task Force has the responsibility of gathering deep intelligence, conducting investigations, and implementing tactical operations against individuals and networks involved in drug trafficking.
""Illegal drugs are a serious global law enforcement problem, and police from around the world are working together to fight these illegal activities.
""Law enforcement agencies are deploying advanced technologies to track and capture criminals at all levels of the drug trade. This includes preventing and intercepting the movement of drugs and money as we have seen through recent arrests in PNG and Australia.
""While specific details of the arrest overnight cannot be released until the matter goes to court, police operations are ongoing into the broader criminal syndicate.""
Commissioner Manning again expressed his disgust at individuals involved in the production, transport, and sale of illegal drugs that ultimately destroy communities.
""Cocaine and methamphetamines are a significant problem that not only kill users, but also lead to related violence and harm.
""Well done to all police involved in this operation, leading to another successful arrest.
""We will keep up the fight against people involved with illegal drugs and show no mercy regardless of how they fit into this illegal trade."" Manning added."

CLRC reviews laws on underwater leases and waterways,3/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5078,,Politics,Anticipation,"Keith Iduhu, Lohia Boe Samuel","The Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) advised the Special Parliamentary Committee on Customary Land and Land Reform about its ongoing review of laws relating to underwater leases and waterways in Papua New Guinea.
This initiative, outlined in Terms of Reference number 19 (TOR) 19 - originates from the 2019 National Land Summit Resolutions and was authorized by the Minister for Justice and Attorney General. CLRC Deputy Secretary for Corporate Services, Xavier Winnia, presented this alongside three other TORs related to customary land to the Committee.
TOR 19 addresses critical legal gaps regarding coastal and riparian rights, focusing on land located beneath water - a topic not sufficiently covered in existing legislation.
Deputy Secretary Winnia briefed Committee Chair, Keith Iduhu and members, including Kokopo MP Ereman ToBaining Jnr and Moresby North-West MP Lohia Boe Samuel, on the legal parameters of TOR 19.
“We call it a new concept because it’s not currently captured by law - that’s what the Commission is examining,” said Mr. Winnia.
Mr. Winnia identified several key policy, legal, and administrative challenges under TOR 19:
•	Absence of a national policy on underwater leases and waterways
•	No statutory definitions for 'land', 'land under water', 'underwater leases', or related ownership
•	Questions around whether landowners retain ownership under state acquisition - by compulsion or consent instead of full alienation or forfeiture
•	Need to define nautical limits: the start and end of traditional coastal and riparian rights versus statutory boundaries
•	Ineffective administration of customary land, indicating the need for reform within the Land Department
Committee members scrutinized each TOR’s status, raising detailed questions on policy, legal frameworks, finances, and administrative feasibility.
Deputy Secretary Winnia reported that extensive provincial consultations were held with local administrations, District Development Authorities, landowner groups, NGOs, and government agencies. Essential views gauged during these consultations were consolidated into four draft reports, each featuring preliminary recommendations. These reports will be further vetted before submission to the National Cabinet as formal law reform proposals."

Minister Goi declared that security must be the highest priority, with no leniency for officers, companies, or operators involved in any form of misconduct.
“Security priority number one,” Goi emphasized. “If you’re involved once, you’re out — no second chances.”
The warning targets all aviation personnel, including security staff, charter flight operators, and aircrew. Goi stressed that any security officer who allows a prohibited item, such as firearms or drugs, to pass through airport screening will be terminated immediately.
If a security firm is repeatedly implicated, their contract with the National Airport Corporation (NAC) will also be revoked.
The crackdown extends to rural airstrips and charter operations, with clear instructions for NAC managers at all 22 airports to enforce thorough checks. Pilots, crew, and owners of aircraft carrying illegal cargo will face prosecution.
Goi reminded all aviation staff that public safety is paramount and failure to meet civil aviation standards will result in job loss. “You are not the employer,” he warned, “you must comply or you’re out.”"
PNG seeks to harvest oil and gas reserves before clean energy era arrives,3/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5082,,Business,Anticipation,James Marape,"As talks around climate change intensifies globally, with countries looking to shift to the use of clean energy in the next 20 years, PNG must harvest its oil and gas reserves within this time frame in order to gain from it.
PNG has huge energy reserves that need to be tapped into, developed and sold before the world moves to clean energy.
“Our oil and gas resources in the country, in the next 20 years we want to progress.  I am not a prophet but trust me in this one - technology and science is emerging. If we don’t harvest from our resource in 20 years, in 20 years the world would have migrated to clean energy, that conversation is being discussed as we speak - cleaner energy options are being looked at. There is no other use for our gas and oil – it is purely for energy, petroleum products and electricity as well as other by-products of petroleum like fertilizers and etc. But the world is conscious on shifting towards cleaner energy and in 20 years’ time from today, write this down, the world will see oil and gas from the context of fossil fuel with carbon footprint. And when they see this, your gas will be redundant just like today the world sees coal in a negative sense.”
And in order to avoid this, Prime Minister James Marape is taking a strategic approach to ensure these reserves are harvested before their demand drops, thus reducing the profitability and value of these resources. Investors must be secured and outstanding petroleum and gas projects need to be developed.
Prime Minister left for the US yesterday in pursuit of this, where he will meet with executives of energy giant, ExxonMobil, to discuss outstanding LNG projects like the Papua LNG, Pnyang and Wildebeest so these projects can be developed and resources harvested.
“My trip to US will see (me) meeting with ExxonMobil. I will synchronize conversations around Papua, Pyyang and Wildebeest LNGs. ExxonMobil is a substantial investor in our country and a good corporate citizen. Based on the success of the PNG LNG, it is our strategic pursuit to make sure Papua LNG is progressed. After Papua, the construction migrates to Pnyang and after Pnyang, we looking at migrating construction also to Wildebeest.
“This is labelled as the Southern fault belt in geological terms – that’s Western Province, Hela, Southern Highlands and Gulf – we have substantial oil and gas resource there. We want to optimize those in the context of harvesting the gas,” Marape said.
Marape also acknowledged the investment made by Total Energy SA in the Papua LNG project. Total is also involved in deep sea exploration in the Mailu area of Abau District
“I want to commended Total. Total’s spending over 100 million dollars this year on deep sea exploration on a field called Mailu field, somewhere in between Milne Bay and Central, an exciting field in that part of our country,” Marape added.
“As a country in the next 20 years, we want to mobilize and harvest all our gas and oil as the world moves towards conversation on clean energy and that is the game plan we have.”
While in the US, Marape will also meet with Newmont executives to discuss the Wafi-Golpu Mining Development Contract with the aim of gaining above 55 per cent of the stake in this project.
“It is no secret – all of you know by now. We are always in negotiation to win above 55 per cent state take in a project – whether its royalty, equity or levies or other earnings like tax, we always want to get a minimum at 55 per cent.”
The Prime Minister says this agreement and other resource agreements are entered into on a 40-year contract basis and it is vital to get it right in the first place before parties sign on it."

Unreliable power supply poses a threat to development of Lae SEZ,2/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5073,,Business,Frustration,Richard Maru,"For Lae to have a Special Economic Zone, its power supply has to be reliable. Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, brought this to the attention of PNG Ports Corporation, labelling Lae as a ""City of Blackouts.""
“Lae is probably the blackout city of Papua New Guinea and I want to stress to the Chairman and CEO of PNG Ports Corporation that, to have a SEZ you must have reliable power and you need to factor that in your plan. Most people will come into your SEZ if they know they can be guaranteed with power instead of the constant blackouts right now in Lae.
“It’ll be difficult for us to attract contractors when there is constant blackouts in Lae.”
According to World Bank, for a city to effectively function as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), it requires robust infrastructure. This includes reliable electricity and water supply, efficient transportation links, reliable telecommunications, and adequate waste management systems. These elements are crucial for supporting industrial activities, attracting investment, and ensuring the smooth operation of businesses within the SEZ.
“I’ve been to many SEZ’s around the world, they don’t depend on the power utility, they provide their own power, water and sewerage. I want to challenge the Board and management, how do you make it more attractive because we will give the incentives?” Maru asked
By having a Special Economic Zonein Lae, it will become an economic hub with increased investment, job creation, and improved infrastructure — but it will also require careful planning to manage social and environmental impacts."

He currently leads the Economic Security Unit at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in the Highlands, where he works directly with displaced families and communities torn by tribal violence.
“This opportunity allowed me to share Papua New Guinea’s story of resilience and community-led peacebuilding,” Tambi said.
“It reaffirmed that even in the most remote and conflict-affected areas, local leadership and dialogue can build bridges.”
At the summit, he engaged in forums on youth leadership, refugee responses, and international cooperation, while also presenting his Makole community reconciliation initiative.
Delegates visited the New South Wales Parliament, shared traditional cultures during a Cultural Peace Walk, and explored collaborative ways to address global conflict.
Tambi’s participation gave PNG a voice in international peace dialogue—one rooted in lived experience, cultural identity, and grassroots action. His story now inspires a new generation of young Papua New Guineans to rise as agents of peace in their own communities."
PNGUoT graduates to be globally competitive,1/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5053,,Education,Joy,Nill,"Engineering graduates from the Papua New Guinea University of Technology, in Lae, are now able to work anywhere in the world without the need to undergo additional assessments.
The atmosphere at PNGUoT on Monday, June 30th, was a mixture of pride, relief, enthusiasm and satisfaction.
The Taraka campus looked pristine as it welcomed local and international visitors to join PNGUoT as it celebrated the accreditation of all five of its academic programs, under the Faculty of Engineering.
The programs were accredited by Engineers Australia, under the prestigious Washington Accord, following a comprehensive review in September 2024.
The journey to offer globally recognised engineering degrees with honours, to PNGUoT graduates, started in 2017, and came to a successful close on December 18, 2024, when its courses were granted full accreditation by Engineers Australia.
In a press briefing before the main event, chancellor Sam Koim said this is not just an achievement for the university, but also for PNG, as PNGUoT is the first institution in the Pacific to have its engineering courses on par with the rest of the world.
“This is a very important moment not only for the university and the students who are going to be graduating from the five engineering courses but also for the country, as we are turning 50 years old,” Koim stated. “We reflect on what we have achieved and what we are capable of achieving.
“This is a very good milestone and that would not have been possible without the active participation and involvement of the vice chancellor and the senior management, academic staff and the industry.”
Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology, Kinoka Feo, said PNGUoT’s accreditation is one of the top three events that will be highlighted by his ministry in commemoration of PNG’s 50th Independence anniversary.
“For us, that fits in well with the 50th anniversary of Papua New Guinea and my continual demand – so to speak – to all our universities and colleges, is to increase access and improve quality,” Minister Feo said.
“Unitech, I’m proud and happy and thank you for the strong leadership, vice chancellor and chancellor. It had to start with leadership, and for you both to provide strong leadership and for a supportive team to work together to achieve this milestone, is testament to your leadership and the combined effort of everyone involved.”
Minister Feo said this achievement should serve as a stepping stone towards continuous improvement for PNGUoT, while other tertiary institutions in the country need to step up and be globally competitive as well."
Doctor Behind Fake COVID-19 Research Firm Arrested,1/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5046,,Crime,Disgust,Nill,"Police have arrested the owner of a fake medical drug company for allegedly misappropriating K5 million of funds allocated for research on COVID-19 drugs.
According to the director of the National Fraud and Anti-Corruption Directorate (NFACD) Detective Superintendent Robert Volo, K5 million was allegedly paid for the Research and Testing of Corona virus (COVID-19) Drugs in 2022 by the National Aids Council Secretariat (NACS) to a fake company owned by the named man, Dr Bomai Kerenga. However, it was discovered that these monies were misapplied without spending on the intended purpose.
Police alleged that in August 2020, the named man took advantage of the COVID-19 situation in 2019 and registered the fake company for the Scientific Research of COVID-19 drugs. The man then submitted a proposal to the National Executive Council of which the NEC accepted and approved K10.2 million to conduct Research and Testing of COVID-19 drugs. This drew negative criticisms back then.
Volo said in 2022, the National Government allocated K5million of the approved funds into the Trust Account of NACS for the fake medical company, where the payments were drawn down by the owner of the company from there.
He said the owner of the fake company instructed NACs to pay into nominated accounts for the service providers who unfortunately were not related to the Research and Testing of COVID-19 drugs.
Volo said police investigation uncovered the unrelated expenditures, including the legal bills, hire cars, creditors, and individuals not related to the scientific research, which resulted in his arrest."

Parliamentary Committee begins inquiry into state authorities,1/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5055,,Government,Trust,Gary Juffa,"The Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery (SPCPSRSD) is intensifying its efforts to ensure robust governance and accountability across government authorities, with a particular focus on Papua New Guinea's vital forestry, minerals, and fisheries sectors.
The Committee expressed its satisfaction with the Papua New Guinea Forest Authority's (PNGFA) decision to re-engage the services of SGS Limited. SGS Limited provides log export monitoring services. The Chairman of the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery, Gary Juffa, stated, ""The Committee is pleased that the PNGFA has re-engaged the service of SGS Limited. This is a positive step by the national government to seriously address good governance within the forestry sector, a critical element necessary for PNG to avoid being placed on the grey list.""
Despite this positive development, the Committee affirmed its intent to continue its inquiry into the PNG Forest Authority. A notice has been sent to the PNG Forest Authority requesting further information regarding their operations. The Committee highlighted that serious recommendations from the Toss Barnett inquiry and the SABL inquiry have, in its view, not been adequately implemented. The ongoing inquiry will also assess how the government plans to implement its commitment to ban round log exports.
In line with promoting national development, the Committee strongly encourages Papua New Guinean companies to engage in downstream processing. It also urges the national government to collaborate with District Development Authorities, provincial governments, and Papua New Guinean development companies and organizations to achieve this objective.
The broader objective of the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery's reviews into various government-created authorities is to determine whether these authorities are meeting their responsibilities to their stakeholders, primarily the people of PNG.
The Committee aims to ascertain if these authorities are effectively carrying out their duties, including monitoring, reviewing, charging fines and penalties where necessary, and regulating appropriately. The Committee has found that in many instances, authorities are not performing these duties efficiently or effectively enough.
As part of these comprehensive reviews, the Committee will also be conducting inquiries into:
•	The PNG Forest Authority
•	The Minerals Resource Authority
•	The National Fisheries Authority
The overarching goal of these inquiries is to ensure that these organizations are adequately and sufficiently protecting the interests of Papua New Guineans.
The Committee in a statement emphasized that it remains committed to pursuing its agenda of public inquiry to ensure transparency and effectiveness in the public sector and to ensure these authorities are protecting the interests of Papua New Guinea."

Sea Shepherd assists Bougainville combat illegal fishing,1/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5057,,Environment,Trust,Nill,"Sea Shepherd vessel Allankay has arrived in Buka to support law enforcement efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing through at-sea patrols in partnership with the Bougainville Police Service and the Department of Primary Industries and Marine Resources.
Bougainvillean law enforcement agents who have the authority to board, inspect and arrest fishing vessels engaged in criminal activity, will be stationed on board Allankay, working alongside Sea Shepherd crew to patrol the internal waters of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville which consists of two main islands, but also several atolls including remote places like Nissan, the Carterets, the Takuu Atoll, the Nuguria Islands and the Nukumanu Islands.
On arrival in Buka, Allankay was welcomed by the ABG President Ishmael Toroama, who stated that Sea Shepherd Global is supporting the nation during a critical time in the region’s history and noted the arrival of Allankay as “a milestone”, stating that “actions speak louder than words” when thanking Sea Shepherd Global for delivering on a commitment to send a ship to support patrolling efforts.
The Autonomous Region of Bougainville is located in the tropical waters of the Coral Triangle, a global epicenter of marine biodiversity often referred to as the “Amazon of the Seas” because it hosts over three-quarters of known coral species, providing food, habitat and spawning grounds for over 3,000 species of fish, six of seven species of sea turtles, 950 different types of mollusks and 458 species of crustaceans.
Many of those species are endemic or endangered and they need to be protected from illegal fishing, a practice that also poses a major threat to the people of Bougainville since subsistence and artisanal fishing are a pillar of the economy.
In his speech, Sea Shepherd Global’s Director of Campaigns Peter Hammarstedt said, “As environmentalists, we believe in being proactive rather than reactive in assisting the Autonomous Bougainville Government to tackle the conservation challenges facing the Coral Triangle, one of the most beautiful and important marine ecosystems in the world. Thus, the time to support the People of Bougainville is not tomorrow. It’s not in two years’ time. The time to support is today.”"
IOM and PNG Affirm Commitment to Migration and Development,29/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5026,,International,Trust,John Rosso,"The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reaffirmed its strong and growing partnership with the Government of Papua New Guinea during a high-level courtesy visit by IOM Regional Director for Asia Pacific, Iori Kato to the Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso.
The engagement underscored the shared commitment and strong relationship between IOM and the government of Papua New Guinea in addressing the country’s most pressing migration and development challenges, particularly in the context of climate change, disaster response, internal displacement, rapid population growth, rural-urban migration and increased regional mobility.
During the meeting, IOM reiterated its support for Papua New Guinea’s national priorities through a comprehensive and collaborative approach focused on:
•	Humanitarian assistance and disaster risk management: Enhancing preparedness and response capacities for vulnerable communities at risk of displacement due to environmental and socio-economic pressures.
•	Planned relocations and local development: Providing technical assistance to support safe, voluntary movements and community-driven planning in climate-affected areas.
•	Border and migration governance: Supporting the Government of Papua New Guinea to implement its border management priorities and strengthen systems that enable safe, orderly, and well-managed migration for all, in line with its growing role as a country of origin, transit, and destination in the Pacific region.
•	Labour mobility and human capital development: Facilitating inclusive labour mobility pathways and workforce development focusing empowering youth and marginalized populations to build a resilient and skilled workforce that meets evolving labour market demands.
•	Land governance: Supporting inclusive dialogue and participatory land governance approaches that recognize the links between migration, displacement, and access to land; promoting respect for traditional ownership systems and fostering social cohesion in affected communities.
•	Service delivery: Strengthening national and sub-national capacities to plan and deliver inclusive, responsive essential services in displacement-affected communities, aligned with long-term development goals and ensuring no one is left behind.
Deputy Prime Minister Rosso acknowledged IOM’s continued technical and operational support in helping Papua New Guinea manage its complex migration landscape.
“Papua New Guinea is facing urgent challenges from rapid population growth and urban drift, which are placing immense pressure on basic services and contributing to law-and-order issues in our towns and cities,” he said.
“At the same time, climate change is threatening the very existence of our atoll communities. The Carteret Islands, for instance, represent the world’s first known case of climate change displacement. We must act decisively and compassionately to support affected communities.”
Mr. Kato reaffirmed IOM’s long-standing commitment to working in close partnership with the Government to ensure that migration is safe, orderly, and beneficial for all Papua New Guineans.
“As the Pacific faces increasingly complex migration dynamics, IOM remains a dedicated partner to Papua New Guinea in delivering practical, people-centred solutions,” said Mr. Kato.
“We commend the Government’s leadership and reaffirm our support in strengthening policy, preparedness, and operational capacities.”
This engagement forms part of IOM’s broader mission to advance the Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) in Papua New Guinea. It also aligns with the Government’s Vision 2050 and commitment to resilient, inclusive development."

Plans to overhaul trade regulatory systems,28/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5022,,Business,Anticipation,Richard Maru,"The government will shortly incorporate an electronic platform called the National Electronic Single Window (ESW) system to do trade. This was announced by the Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, who informed PNG Ports of their involvement in the new system.
“The Government will shortly be incorporating a new company which will have a new IT system called “Single Windows” to do trade. It’s a K20million investment and it’ll be anchored in PNG Customs. In the future we want to do all trade transactions online and real-time within 10mintues. I don’t want any more paperwork.”
The Single Window System is commonly used in trade, customs, and regulatory environments. It is a trade facilitation concept where traders and businesses can submit all required import, export and transit-related information and documents through a single, centralized point to fulfill all regulatory requirements. This streamlines processes, reduces paperwork, and enhances efficiency in international trade. The system then distributes this information electronically to all relevant authorities.
Minister Maru said, “PNG Ports will be a major partner. The world started on “Single Windows” 25 years ago, we are so far behind. Singapore is the leading nation now in the world and they process nine million transactions a year and that investment is coming soon.”
Traders in developed countries use the system to submit customs declarations, permits, and certificates once via a single window, which then shares the info with customs, port authorities, health inspections, and more. Citizens or companies can apply for multiple licenses or approvals through one online portal instead of dealing with each agency individually.
“This platform is to improve the efficiency of trade through electronic transactions. Whether you are in NAQIA, Customs, CIC or others you will all migrate to this system.”"

Addressing dependence on meat imports,28/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5024,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"The Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) is working to establish a body with statutory powers to regulate its livestock industry in the country.
The purpose is to swiftly create clear guidelines and standards because there is excessive dependence on foreign meat imports, which continue to drain the foreign reserves.
Speaking during the recent officiating of LDC public servants induction ceremony, the Managing Director Terry Koim referenced LDC as a commercial body that has no regulatory powers to regulate the livestock industry in the country.
“Right now LDC as a company is a player, but we are working to set up a regulatory authority that will serve as a referee to regulate the industry,“ he stated.
PNG spends almost K1 billion on imports to the detriment of smallholder livestock farmers.
MD Koim said according to available data, PNG spent K9.4 billion on frozen and chilled meat imports from 2012 – 2022.
This adds to the ongoing financial burden we are placing on our limited foreign reserves, and LDC is taking proactive steps to addressing this dilemma by setting up the regulatory authority that will take charge of the livestock industry.
He stated that the completion of the National Livestock Policy will form the basis to do a legislative review to create the Livestock Industry Authority, which will fill that void to regulate the livestock industry.
Referencing the recent grievances raised by smallholder poultry farmers of no proper market system in place for them, Koim stated that this was also the result of absence of regulations hence reiterating the need for the current Livestock policy and legislative reviews to be concluded.
Addressing a billion kina meat import deficit cannot be addressed by LDC alone as a company.
For PNG to become self-reliant in meat production we must first have the correct policy and regulation in place to ensure that everybody in our country knows where we are and where we are going in livestock.
MD Koim said currently the Department of Agriculture (DoA) being a custodian of all agriculture policy matters is taking the lead in engaging with stakeholders in reviewing this important policy.
He added that LDC will still be a player once the regulatory authority is established but with limited scope as its businesses will be semi-privatized through partnership with interested investors as directed by the government."

PNG to benefit from USD $42 million GEF funded program,28/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5025,,Environment,Anticipation,Nill,"A new Global Environment Facility (GEF) funded initiatives called the Southeast Asia and the Pacific Forest Integrated Program was launched at an inception workshop in Shiang Mai, Thailand this week.
The program will be led by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
The program channels USD 42.4 million in GEF grants and USD 185 million in co-financing to three country projects in Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand and one regional coordination project, aiming to protect the primary forests of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.
It aims to improve the management of 3.2 million hectares of protected areas and over 7 million hectares of landscapes, restore 8,500 hectares of degraded ecosystems, mitigate 34 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions, and benefit nearly 20,000 people.
Country projects will be implemented by FAO and UNDP and executed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Lao PDR, the Conservation and Environment Protection Authority of Papua New Guinea, and the Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Thailand.
The Regional Coordination Project, led by IUCN and FAO with partners such as CIFOR-ICRAF and Grow Asia, will bring together countries across the region to align their strategies, share knowledge and practical experience, and catalyze coordinated action across the biome.
Stretching from Bhutan to Papua New Guinea, the Indo-Malaya Forest biome harbors one of the last major primary forest areas in the world, hosting more than 5,000 threatened species. 60% of its original vegetation is already lost, and the remaining primary forests are under pressure from unsustainable agriculture, logging, and competing land use.
Over 560 million people in the region depend on the resources provided by these forests, such as water regulation, carbon sequestration, and timber and non-timber forest products.
The aim of this GEF funded program is to maintain the integrity of these primary forests so they can deliver biodiversity, climate, and livelihood benefits to its inhabitants.
Eight countries in the region participated in the inception workshop – Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam – and further developed the program’s objectives and coordination mechanisms.
Countries and partners agreed on priority outputs that the six-year program should address, including a regional vision on primary forests, a primary forest investment forum, and a knowledge and learning hub.
The program will support the development of coherent policies, frameworks, and strategies at national and regional levels to help minimize the loss of primary forests and promote the recognition of other effective area-based conservation mechanisms in primary forest landscapes. The regional coordination project will enhance collaboration and south-south cooperation to facilitate knowledge exchange, technical support, and capacity development for improved management of primary forests across borders.
The program is one of five GEF integrated investments for primary forests under the GEF-8 replenishment. The program will connect with the GEF-8 Critical Forest Biomes Integrated Programs for the Amazon, Guinean Forests, Mesoamerica, and the Congo Basin to drive global systems change in globally important tropical forest landscapes."

He also congratulated Jacks of PNG in giving all Papua New Guineans the opportunity to celebrate creativity and local talent across the nation, for people even with less resources, such as the inmates.
It was an emotional moment for young Sebastian as he did not believe an inmate like him could win, he only did the designs as he had a desire for artwork. This truly paid off and now he has been awarded the K10, 000 prize money.
Professor Garnier will be assisting him to create a bank account later on to secure his funds."
HIV Declared a National Crisis,27/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5015,,Health,Fear,Elias Kapavore,"HIV has been declared a national crisis following an alarming rise in HIV cases, particularly among women and children, with mother-to-child transmission rates critically high.
Papua New Guinea is experiencing a sharp resurgence in HIV, with the estimated number of new infections doubling since 2010.
Recent data indicates that approximately 30 new HIV infections occur each day, amounting to an estimated 11,000 new cases in 2024 alone.
Worryingly, nearly half of these new cases (14 out of 30) are among children and young people aged 24 and below. This trend underscores the epidemic’s deepening impact on the next generation and highlights the urgent need for scaled-up investments in HIV prevention, testing, and treatment, particularly for children, mothers, and adolescents.
Of particular concern is the continued high rate of mother-to-child transmission. In 2024, an estimated 2,700 infants were newly infected with HIV—equivalent to seven babies per day. Most of these cases occurred because mothers were unaware of their HIV status and, as a result, did not receive the necessary antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy or breastfeeding which could have effectively prevented HIV transmission to their babies.
This major gap in maternal health highlights the urgent need to increase antenatal care uptake and expand HIV testing, counselling, and treatment for all pregnant women across Papua New Guinea.
“The rise in new HIV infections in PNG is deeply concerning. And as such, I am declaring this a National HIV Crisis,” said the Minister for Health, Elias Kapavore.
“HIV is a disease of inequality. We need to support and empower those most impacted. It is time for all of us to step-up. I personally commit to raising this issue with my fellow ministers and parliamentarians and ensuring the urgent allocation of resources to protect our people – especially the next generation of Papua New Guineans. ""
Echoing the Minister’s remarks, Acting Secretary for the Department of Health, Ken Wai, stated, “We must scale-up access to HIV testing and treatment, particularly for groups most at risk. These priority initiatives should be offered at health facilities nationwide, and will require community leadership and support.”
Dr. Sevil Huseynova, WHO Country Representative in Papua New Guinea, added, “We must strengthen our health systems to ensure universal access to HIV testing, treatment, and prevention services, especially for pregnant women and young people. This is a test of our collective commitment to health for all. WHO stands firmly with the Government of Papua New Guinea to scale up integrated, person-centered care that leaves no one behind.”
UNAIDS Country Director, Manoela Manova strongly backed the statements made by the Health Minister and Acting Secretary, placing particular emphasis on the importance of ending stigma.
“This is a shared public health crisis that demands shared responsibility. Everyone has a role to play in dismantling harmful myths, stigma, and discrimination associated with HIV. These attitudes undermine prevention, testing and treatment efforts, and hold us back from ending HIV as a public health threat in Papua New Guinea.”
UN Resident Coordinator in PNG Richard Howard reinforced the collective urgency of the moment.
“The United Nations stands in full solidarity with the Government of Papua New Guinea in confronting this national HIV crisis. We cannot afford to lose another generation to HIV. The time to act decisively - through coordinated leadership, strategic investment, and community-driven solutions - is now.”
Adding the voice of the community, Lesley Bola, Executive Director of the Key Population Advocacy Consortium (KPAC), stated, “Behind every statistic is a real person—someone’s child, friend, partner. We cannot end this crisis without meaningfully engaging the people most affected: key populations, women, youth. Community-led action is not optional - it is essential. We urge government, donors, and all partners to support scaled-up, human rights-based, community-driven HIV responses. The future of Papua New Guinea hinges on bold, urgent action - now.”
This declaration will trigger activation of a national HIV Emergency Response Plan, enhance coordination across all sectors, and prioritise investments in HIV services at every level."
Senior IT officer charged with misappropriation,27/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5016,,Crime,Anger,Nill,"A senior payroll officer attached with the Department of Finance’s Information and Communication Technology Division responsible for the National Capital District Provincial Health Authority’s salaries, was arrested and charged on Wednesday 25th June 2025 for abuse of office, conspiracy and misappropriation of funds worth K1.9 million.
Director National Fraud and Anti-Corruption Directorate (NFACD), Detective Superintendent, Robert Volo said the named officer was charged for one count each of Conspiracy, Abuse of office and Misappropriation under the Criminal Code Act (CCA), 1974.
Volo said the officer works as a payroll officer in the Finance Department. The officer is responsible for the NCDPHA salaries and misappropriated the funds while taking carriage of the NCDPHA Alesco Payroll system.
He said this was the third arrest whilst the officer’s cohorts Vaieke Vare Vani, former Deputy Director of Corporate Services case is pending in the National Court and Priscilla Kend, former Director of the Corporate Services, is also being dealt at he Waigani Committal Court.
Police investigations revealed that there were fraudulent transfers of salaries into various BSP Salary Accounts of eleven (11) staff from the National Capital District Provincial Health Authority in total of K1.9million on Pay No.13 of 2023.
Mr Volo said the police at NFACD conducted a thorough investigation into the alleged complaint laid by the former NCDPHA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr. Steven Yennie, resulting in his arrest.
Police alleged that on 28th June 2023, during the Public Servants Pay No. 13 of 2023, the named senior ICT officer, being responsible for the payroll deliberately in collaboration with Senior Officers within the Human Resources and Corporate Services Division illegally transferred a total sum of K1,871,152,67 into various salary accounts with inflated amounts for 11 officers in NCD.
From the total salary disbursed, Vaieke Vare Vani, the Deputy Director Corporate received K1,023,909,95 into his salary account. It was uncovered that the staff were paid extra salary through the unauthorized offline payroll system on pay 13 of 2023.
Police investigation has indicated that the proceeds from the extra salaries were then collected by the former Manageress of the Human Resources Division of NCDPHA from individual health workers in cash and re-distributed the cash to officers who facilitated the illegal payments including the senior ICT officer responsible for the payroll.
He said that it is incumbent upon the defendant and his co-accused to prove in court on whether they followed the due process and procedures in transferring the money.
“I reinforce the directorate’s commitment to fight fraud and corruption in the country with the limited resources available. I encourage members of the public and any stakeholders having Fraud and Corruption complaint to report to the NFACD.
“It does not mean we investigate all fraud, and corruption matters here but those cases that meet our set investigation criteria,” Mr Volo said.
Mr Volo further extended his invitation to the public to report any sighting of Evelyn Pakawa, former Human Resources Manageress of the NCDPHA, who was the mastermind behind the NCDPHA Payroll scam in 2023, and is currently hiding from the police."

Melanesian Agreement Signed,27/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5013,,Politics,Trust,"Belden Namah, James Marape","Prime Minister James Marape and Autonomous Bougainville Government President Ishmael Toroama on Thursday 26 June, signed the landmark Melanesian Agreement in Port Moresby, charting a peaceful and legally defined course for the next phase of the Bougainville peace process.
The ceremony was witnessed by Moderator Sir Jerry Mateparae, ministers from both governments, members of the bipartisan Parliamentary Committee on Bougainville, senior public servants, and international partners including the United Nations and foreign diplomatic missions.
Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed the National Government’s total adherence to the constitutional process, stating that the Bougainville issue must proceed according to the provisions of the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement, now enshrined in Part XIV of the Constitution.
He acknowledged the 97.7% referendum result as clear and decisive, but emphasised that the outcome must still pass through the legal pathway:
Marape said, “The people of Bougainville have expressed their will through the referendum, and we fully respect that. However, our Constitution outlines a clear process—we must conduct consultations and present the outcome to Parliament, which holds final decision-making authority. As Prime Minister, I cannot bypass or override that process.”
The Melanesian Agreement provides a framework for the two governments to finalise consultations and prepare a report for submission to Parliament.
Prime Minister Marape described it as a collaborative and conditional document that continues the journey, rather than ends it.
“This is not an agreement to divide us—it is a roadmap to guide us through the remaining stages, grounded in constitutional integrity and mutual understanding. Our ultimate goal is to reach a destination that respects Bougainville’s aspirations while preserving the legal foundation of our nation,” stated Marape.
Drawing on the deep historical bonds between Papua New Guinea and Bougainville, Prime Minister Marape reflected on the ancestral unity of Melanesian peoples long before the creation of the modern nation in 1975:
“Before there was a constitution—before there was a country called Papua New Guinea—there were Melanesian people living in this part of the earth. We lived on the mainland, on the islands, and in the Pacific. The Melanesian concept of people is inherent—we were already sovereign in our own way.”
He stressed that Papua New Guineans and Bougainvilleans are ""people of the same stock,"" and that the constitutional process must reflect both modern governance and traditional values.
“We don’t have to fear the past or the future. Let’s jointly work together. The constitutional process is clear. Respect for the authority of our Constitution is paramount.”
Prime Minister Marape thanked the people of Bougainville for honouring the constitutional process, and made special mention of Bougainville’s historical relationship with Papua New Guinea:
“I want to say thank you to President Toroama and the people of Bougainville for respecting the Constitution of our country. The Melanesian Agreement we signed today acknowledges our shared responsibility to walk this path together, with mutual respect and in the spirit of Melanesian brotherhood.”
He reminded the people of Bougainville of PNG’s long-standing commitment, citing a pivotal moment in 1997 when members of the PNG Defence Force, including now-Minister Hon. Belden Namah, opposed the Sandline operation as an act of solidarity with Bougainville:
“Our soldiers cared for you. That was a clear statement from Papua New Guinea—that we care.”
Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed the government’s commitment to empowering Bougainville economically, referencing recent decisions to transfer full shareholding in key resource projects to the Bougainville Government.
“Giving back Panguna to you means you decide your own destiny. That is the highest form of acknowledgement from your brothers and sisters in the rest of the country.”
He pledged support for Bougainville’s sustainable development across agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and infrastructure, stating, “We are here to empower you so your people can prosper. Let us prepare Bougainville not just for political settlement, but for a thriving future.”
Prime Minister Marape acknowledged President Toroama’s pivotal role in the peace process—from being a signatory to the original 2001 Peace Agreement to now leading Bougainville through this crucial chapter:
“Your leadership at this crucial time is no accident. You bring historical wisdom and strength to a very delicate and important process.”
He also paid tribute to Sir Jerry Mateparae for his longstanding role as moderator: “Sir Jerry has been with us since 1997. His calm leadership and presence have helped us maintain focus and discipline throughout this journey. We deeply appreciate his service to both Bougainville and PNG.”
Looking ahead to the submission of the final consultation report by June 30, Prime Minister Marape assured both Bougainvilleans and Papua New Guineans that the journey would continue in peace, unity, and trust.
“Let no one fear. We remain united in purpose. As one people, we are navigating this process together—with humility, with care, and with faith in our Constitution and in each other.”"

United action required to stop unregulated alluvial mining,26/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5000,,Business,Fear,Rainbo Paita,"Community leaders, landowners, and small-scale miners around the country have been called to stand together and tackle growth of unregulated alluvial mining across the country.
The Papua New Guinea Chamber of Resources & Energy (PNG CORE) in a statement said unregulated alluvial mining poses a serious threat to the mining industry, local communities, and legitimate small-scale miners.
According to PNG CORE, recent reports have highlighted a surge in illegal mining practices, gold smuggling, and a decline in lawful alluvial gold production, raising alarm across the sector.
As the peak body representing the minerals sector, PNG CORE is deeply concerned about the environmental damage, social disruption, and economic harm caused by these unregulated activities.
Such operations not only endanger surrounding communities but also erode sustainable development opportunities and fair competition for compliant miners.
PNG CORE urges community leaders and landowners to take proactive steps to protect their land and people’s future.
This includes refusing access to illegal miners, reporting suspicious activities to the authorities, and verifying all mining engagements with the MRA before proceeding.
Small-scale miners are also strongly encouraged to pursue legal operations by securing the necessary licenses and permits for machinery use.
Legal compliance ensures safer, environmentally responsible mining practices and contributes meaningfully to both community welfare and national development.
Addressing illegal and unregulated alluvial mining requires a coordinated, multi-stakeholder approach focused on formalisation, environmental stewardship, community health, and strengthened governance.
In response to these developments, the Mineral Resources Authority (MRA) has issued a public stop-work notice targeting unauthorised alluvial mining operations involving heavy machinery.
This enforcement followed confirmed reports of individuals and companies conducting illegal mining activities in designated alluvial mining districts and other regions.
MRA emphasised that these operations violate the Mining Act 1992 and warned that further breaches would result in legal consequences.
Echoing this regulatory stance, Mining Minister Rainbo Paita issued a strong warning to all operators. “Operate within your permits or leave.”
Minister Paita reaffirmed the government’s zero-tolerance approach to illegal mining, stressing that all mining activities must comply with the terms of their permits and licenses.
He emphasised that failure to do so undermines the integrity of the sector and will not be tolerated."

This historic agreement represents the first lease of its kind at Nadzab for a local import-export business, positioning the airport as a key gateway for facilitating market access and economic opportunity across Papua New Guinea. The initiative enables AFIA PNG to develop and operate a modern ""Cargo Terminal and Systems"" that will support the movement of both dry and perishable goods, offering a transformative supply chain solution for rural producers.

The current phase is about unlocking revenue from that infrastructure, through land leases, business partnerships, service concessions, and public-private co-developments.''

PNG has already met the requirement under EITI to ensure all extractive companies disclose who their owners are, so the government should extend the same approach to the remainder of companies so as to meet the FATF requirements,” said Ms. Arianne Kassman representing Transparency International PNG, President elect of the PNGRGC.
The PNGRGC is the peak body representing civil society interests in the Papua New Guinea Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (PNGEITI), which is a process whereby extractive companies disclose payments made to the State, and revenue agencies report payments received by industry, as well as having to comply with other standards related to sub-national transfers, contract transparency, and related to gender opportunities and environmental accountability.
The PNGRGC is a registered association whose members are themselves registered associations, working to promote good governance in the extractive sector of Papua New Guinea.

Maritime industry embrace value-based teaching,25/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4988,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"P&O Maritime Logistics has set a new course for the maritime industry by becoming the first company to partner with the Senisim PNG Leadership Program, marking a pivotal step in values-based transformation at sea.
Last Friday, the company hosted its first “Transformation Table” session aboard the vessel Resilience at Motukea, Port Moresby. Led by Senisim PNG National coordinator Phillie Marai and supported by the Tribal Foundation, the session engaged 25 crew members—including the ship’s captain—around the core theme of Hope, a key value of the leadership program.
P&O’s commitment to instilling values-driven leadership was praised as a significant cultural shift within an industry known for its operational intensity and hierarchical structures. The company plans to roll out the program to its head office and across all 12 vessels in its fleet by 2025.
This collaboration marks the first time the Senisim PNG Movement has entered the maritime sector, setting a powerful precedent. The initiative is part of a broader vision by the Tribal Foundation to instill identity-rooted leadership and nation-building values across Papua New Guinea.
By anchoring leadership in local values and purpose, P&O is not only navigating seas but also steering toward national transformation."
SARV Victims’ Families Receive Support,25/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4995,,HumanRights,Sadness,Nill,"Two women who were victims of sorcery accusation-related violence (SARV) have died in Simbu Province, with the PNG Tribal Foundation stepping in to support their grieving families in what the Foundation describes as a continuing humanitarian crisis.
One of the women, a 40-year-old mother of three from Piau village, Tabare LLG, Sinesine Yongomugl, died last week after suffering from what relatives described as a stress-related illness.
Her son had been brutally tortured and killed in March 2024 after being accused of sorcery following the death of a prominent man in the area. Their home was destroyed in the aftermath, displacing over 150 people from the community.
“The emotional trauma she endured after losing her son and home was too much. She became ill and passed away,” a spokesperson from PNG Tribal Foundation said.
To help the family lay her to rest, the Foundation provided over K1,500 for the haus krai, food, and coffin expenses over the weekend.
In a separate case, a 35-year-old woman from Kombumogo village, Kerowagi, who was a key eyewitness in an ongoing SARV case before the National Court in Mt Hagen, also died over the weekend. She had been living in a care centre since September 2023 when her house and gardens were destroyed following another SARV incident.
She died due to childbirth complications at Mt Hagen General Hospital.
“She was one of our key witnesses. We had been supporting her during the court process and recently gave K500 to help transport her body back to her village,” said the spokesperson.
PNG Tribal Foundation President GT Bustin confirmed the organisation had been assisting the witness throughout the legal process, including providing police fuel, filing paperwork, gathering eyewitness accounts, and supplying food.
Bustin added that the Foundation is now also supporting SARV victims in Jiwaka Province, where a volunteer is collecting witness statements from Jimi and South Wahgi districts, following a request from the State Prosecutor during a court session in Mt Hagen last Thursday. The case has been adjourned to July.
In addition to SARV response work, the Foundation is providing support to a family in a child sexual abuse case involving a four-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by her biological father.
The case, now before the Simbu District Court, saw the suspect remanded at Barawagi Prison, while the victim remains in a safe house. Medical reports were obtained from Mt Hagen Provincial Hospital last Friday.
The PNG Tribal Foundation continues to play a vital role in supporting survivors of violence and those caught in vulnerable circumstances, especially in areas where access to justice and care remains limited."

PNGFA seals MOU to progress downstream processing,23/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4956,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"The PNG Forest Authority has been given the authority to venture into commercial forestry through its business arm, PNG Diwai Holding Limited.
In pursuing this further, the PNGFA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of International Trade and Investment (DITI) and PNG Diwai Holdings Ltd (PNGDHL) on Friday, June 20.
The MOU enables the establishment and Development of the Pilot Integrated Forestry Special Economic Zone (FSEZ).
PNGFA becomes the first sector agency to partner with DITI.
DITI secretary, Jacinta Manua stated: “We are in full agreement with this MOU. This is the first time we are signing this with a sector agency, and so it is very important for us. The department is pushing the agenda of Special Economic Zones,” said Manua.
The MOU seals four activities: Downstream processing, Forest Plantation Development, establishment of Forest Industrial Parks in four strategic provinces, and carbon offset projects to be undertaken under a thorough process.
PNGFA will focus on downstream processing and industrial parks for a start, with progress made so far. PNGFA managing director, John Mosoro, said the signing is a key achievement, paving the way for all raw products to be processed onshore and exported overseas.
“Now we're starting to look at this seriously, will phase out logging and start building facilities to go into full-scale downstream processing,” said Mosoro.
“For forestry we want the downstream processing as our 50-year achievement going forward next 50 years to have downstream processing facilities in the country and we phase out log exports completely.” (inset clip)
Mosoro stated that a site has been identified in Central Province for a processing plant, with water and electricity available – a key requirement, with discussions in progress.
As per the MOU, the DITI, as a partner in this signing, will focus on sectoral investment growth by creating an enabling business environment under a FSEZ model to attract more foreign investment.
“We are working with the sector agency.  Forestry has been in business for a long time, and they have all the information about the industry itself. We come at the back-end of it, we play support to PNGFA,” said Manua.
A Technical Working Group has been set up to look into the action plan to drive forward the downstream processing initiative.
“We want to move as fast as possible; we want to say that in the forestry sector, we now have an action plan that talks about downstream processing,” added Manua.
She is urging other sectors to also work with the DITI and embrace downstream processing."

Proper land titles key for Sepik Plain SEZ project,23/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4963,,Business,Anticipation,Richard Maru,"The Sepik Plain Special Economic Zone will commence once land titles are secured, enabling investors to invest, says Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru.
Maru said when giving an update on the progress of the Sepik Plain SEZ in Wewak, East Sepik Province.
He said this is a fully funded program under the Marape-Rosso government aimed at making Sepik one of the major economic zones in the country.
The Sepik Plain SEZ will cover a million hectares of land within the Sepik Plain, which includes Yangoru Saussia, Angoram, Ambunti/Drekikier, Maprik, Wosera Gawi, and further to Telefomin in West Sepik Province.
“The zone will include major large-scale agriculture developments focusing on oil palm, and include industrial areas, a township, and colleges.
“Unfortunately, most of the land is owned by the people. Under my watch, no land must be taken from landowners. What we must do is help meet the cost of surveying the land, getting ILGs, and giving state titles to the village people. When we do that, our people will not lose their land,” Maru said.
He said this will enable local landowners to be less marginalized, and land will not be taken away from them.
Minister Maru stated that the challenge now is to give proper state land titles to the landowners, improve infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and power supply, before involving investors.
The Minister added that work is in progress to develop the Hayfill airport in Maprik. This airport will play a key role in bringing investors through the implementation phase of the Sepik SEZ project.
The Sepik Plain SEZ coordinator, Fantson Yaninen, said this project will add value to Papua New Guineans through utilizing their land for investments.
He thanked the Marape-Rosso government for initiating this project."
Yangoru-Saussia launches 9km road project,23/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4965,,Infrastructure,Anticipation,Richard Maru,"A groundbreaking ceremony for a 9km road project to connect Kwarabri to Ambuganja in Yangoru-Saussia District, East Sepik Province was recently officiated by the Member for Yangoru Saussia, Richard Maru.
For the past 50 years, the people of Kwarabri in the Yangoru-Saussia District longed to see tangible development to improve access to services daily. Changes in leadership were a contributing factor, delaying important infrastructure that would enable this. However, this will now be a story of the past as development is beginning to hit this area through the launching of a new road. This is a historic milestone for Maru’s people, 50 years on.
Maru said K400,000 funding was allocated to the project contractor two months ago. This will enable the construction phase to begin without delay. He urged locals to support the project’s construction phase so that it can be delivered in time.
Landowner Joseph Lekiemani said law and order issues are a common challenge faced in the area; therefore, the construction of this road will enable police visibility, which will then mitigate this issue.
Maru added that other development plans will include the construction of a bridge and the implementation of two new generators. Maru made a commitment to complete these developments before September of this year."
Police vehicles damaged,22/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4950,,Crime,Anger,Nill,"Three police vehicles that operate and serve the people of both NCD and Central provinces were damaged by an alleged group of Goilalas who reside at different locations in Port Moresby.
National Capital District Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab confirmed that two Force 10 vehicles and one vehicle from Motu Koita police were damaged on Thursday and Saturday.
He said the two Force 10 vehicles, which were assisting the Central police officers at Fifteen Mile police station, responded to another incident at Bomana in the early hours of Friday and were attacked by a group of armed men alleged to be from Goilala.
""It was night, and the attackers were hiding in the dark when the vehicle got bogged down and was trying to pull out when they stoned the vehicle's windscreens. Help was called for other police units to assist, who responded and rescued the officers and the vehicles. Some suspects were picked up a day later and are now in police custody. They will be interviewed and charged accordingly,"" Met. Supt Simatab said.
The other incident happened on Saturday morning at Badihagwa, where the Motu Koita police bus was stoned by an alleged group of Goilala men. He said one suspect was picked up by members of the community and is now detained in the police cell for questioning.
Simatab said the police vehicles had been helping in policing the city, and with the three vehicles damaged, it will now decrease the police presence in the city.
""I want to call on the public to respect public properties, such as police vehicles. The vehicles are paid for or hired with the people's money, and they help provide police services to the community. With the damage done, we will now have less police presence, which will lead to an increase in law and order problems.
“My call now is for everyone to work with the police to identify those who are stoning the Force 10 vehicles at Bomana and the Motu Koita bus at Badihagwa. We want the community to help us report those individuals damaging public assets,"" Met Supt. Simatab said.
He said the vehicles are in the workshop for maintenance."
New electric trucks introduced to PNG,22/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4949,,Business,Joy,Nill,"In an effort to reduce its carbon footprint, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has imported five electric trucks; one for Port Moresby and four for the industrial city of Lae.
This was made possible through a partnership with Express Freight Management.
This means the company is the first in PNG to use electric trucks that have zero tailpipe emissions, no engine noise that would contribute to noise pollution, and because they depend on electricity, there will be no need for fossil fuels.
The company launched its new electric trucks at the Lae depot warehouse on Friday, 20 June 2025.
Imported from China, one electric truck will be used in Port Moresby, while four will operate in PNG’s industrial hub of Lae city.
CCEP PNG’s commercial director, Tim Solly, outlined that the introduction of these state-of-the-art vehicles into their logistics operation alludes to their bold commitment to a cleaner, greener future.
The company is expecting five more electric trucks to bring their total fleet to 10. The electric trucks have a battery capacity of 500 kilowatts, and can be charged for 6 hours at 60AMP before they can be used to distribute products from CCEP sites to customer sites.
“The infrastructure around charging was one of the big considerations that we had, and it was a concern for us at the beginning,” said Solly. “But we end up charging them on EFM’s site and we have the ability – if power does go off – to use our own genset.
“So, the reality is, we do have the ability to make sure they are fully charged.
“In addition to that, they can go about 300km per charge, anyway. They are much more efficient and effective than fuel-based vehicles.”
Managing director of Express Freight Management, Robert Howden, echoed the sentiment, saying together, they are setting a new benchmark for logistics in Papua New Guinea.
“Working with Coca-Cola has been positive,” he stated, “considering this is a groundbreaking initiative for them. Here we are today with a truck that says ‘100 percent electric’. It’s taken time, it’s taken planning, and results so far, have been better than expected. So, we’re very happy.
“We are making a difference, and we are cutting down on carbon emissions.”
There are two charging stations with the capacity to charge two electric trucks at the same time. One is in Port Moresby while the other is in Lae.
Depending on the load, terrain and distance, an electric truck can potentially run for five days before requiring a charge."

Coordinator of the Reservist Program in NCD/Central, Ruben Giusu, who spearheaded the gathering, saw more than one hundred reservists who were working in NCD and Central show up to demonstrate their support for him and the commanders, indicating that they are ready to work.
ACP NCD/Central was pleased to see the officers show up, acknowledge them, and pledge support to collaborate in strengthening police manpower in the command.
He mentioned that they now have a coordinator and designated office space, allowing everyone to report to the coordinator and work alongside the police station commanders and regular officers to maintain law and order in the community.
While acknowledging them, he also mentioned some of the outstanding police reservist officers who had made significant arrests and secured convictions in high-profile cases.
Giusu said he wants that to continue. He welcomed everyone back to the command and looks forward to working with them.
ACP Southern Command Joseph Puri also stated that since the NCD/Central Command shares a border with his command, he is prepared to collaborate with the reservist officers to enhance manpower in his command due to the road connections now linking other provinces.
Chief Inspector Ruben Giusu, while acknowledging the commanders and the police reservist officers, also took time to share what he will do to help them when he settles down in the office.
He said there are many things to do to bring back all trained reservists because they are part of the RPNGC and have sworn an oath to wear the uniform.
He challenged the reservists that they are still members of the police force, and the bad things the officers do that are captured in the media, which also paint a bad image of all police reservists."

Works Department staff from Milne Bay and Provincial Administration officers drove 13 hours, arriving in Port Moresby at 11am yesterday morning.
Milne Bay is now physically connected to the national economy, enhancing administrative service delivery, tourism, trade, and logistics.
Works and Highways Minister, Soaln Mirism welcomed this historical achievement in the government’s Connect PNG program.
This road now links a critical missing link that is part of the Southern Region Corridor Connectivity plan, which aims to connect Milne Bay Province to the National Capital District via the Central Province
This road will unlock the full economic potential of that region, which has a lot of potential in agriculture, tourism, and petroleum, like the Mailu prospects, which is at the feasibility study stage.
The missing link stretches across Kupiano in Abau District and connects with Boal/Kilakila in the Alotau District of Milne Bay Province
Under Phase 1 (2020-2027) of the Connect PNG program, the government aims to connect all the unlinked provincial capitals to the national road network, starting with Port Moresby to Alotau, apart from Kerema town.
According to Works and Highways Minister, Solan Mirism, this road connection has been a long standing National infrastructure challenge since independence and was relieved that it has been realized in time for the 50th Golden Jubilee Anniversary celebration.
“From Bautama (Central Province) to East Cape (Alotau), which is almost 600kms, completes the Magi Highway. This highway is now a strategic road which will have a greater socio-economic impact on the road side communities.

He said while the highway is still in its early development phase and not fully sealed, it represents a major breakthrough in national infrastructure.
“This is the first-cut stage. Over time, we will build it into a world-class sealed highway. For now, it is already operational — and people are using it.”
To safeguard this progress, Prime Minister Marape confirmed that new law enforcement infrastructure will be built along the highway as part of the broader development vision.
“We intend to include police stations along strategic sections of our highways,” he said.
“These roads must be safe and secure for our people. They are meant for business, tourism, and community development — not for criminal activity.”
He also revealed a new land policy initiative being developed with the Department of Lands and the Department of Commerce and Industry to ensure landowners along the highways can register their land and use it as bankable collateral to start businesses.
“We want our people to go into commercial agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and hospitality. That’s how we convert road infrastructure into economic opportunity,” he said.
“We are already seeing successful ventures — like the export of mud crabs from Central direct to Singapore — and we want to see more of that.”
Prime Minister Marape assured the nation that construction is continuing on remaining links, with less than 30 kilometres left to complete the Port Moresby–Alotau connection.
“It is my intention to personally drive the full stretch of the highway from Port Moresby to Alotau in August this year.”
He also dismissed recent allegations by the Opposition regarding project mismanagement.
“An independent audit is currently underway into the conduct of Works, but that will not stop our determination. Our vision is clear: to connect the country and empower our people through infrastructure.”
“This is our blueprint. From the Highlands to the coast, from West Sepik to Milne Bay, roads are going in. Let us use them to lift our people out of poverty and into prosperity.”"
New Cocoa Nurseries for Pomio LLG,21/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4938,,Development,Trust,Nill,"Six council wards of Pomio Local Level Government (LLG) in Pomio district will now have their own cocoa nurseries. The wards include – Galuwe, Marmar, Pomio, Sali, Olaipun 1 and Olaipun 2.
The East New Britain Provincial Administration and Pomio District administration are working in collaboration with United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and PNG Cocoa Board to establish cocoa nurseries and facilitate nursery management training in these wards. The training started on the 10th and is expected to end on the 28th of June, 2025.
This is part of Component 2 of the Food Systems, Land Use and Restoration (FOLUR) program that is funded by the Global Environment Facility 7 and led by the World Bank.
Cocoa Board New Britain Regional Coordinator, Albina Rarau highlighted that they have rolled out this program in Central Pomio and Inland Baining LLGs in Gazelle District.
Rarau said they are currently doing budwood garden construction and nursery construction with the capacity of the budwood garden at 360 per ward, containing 18 varieties of cocoa. The nursery capacity for each ward is 10 000 per ward. The nurseries for the two LLGs will have a 20 000 capacity and they will be establishing seven nurseries in each district, six for the wards and one for the LLG.
“After the farmers have planted cocoa in their fields, we will roll out the construction of the cocoa solar dryer which includes a storage facility and the dryer,” said Rarau.
She encouraged people from the wards to participate in the program so their livelihood in the communities can be improved.
CCB Field Officer Cornelius Wangun said “the total targeted farmers in each ward is 500 and they will be supplied with 625 cocoa seedlings per farmer. In Marmar ward, we have a nursery capacity of 10 000 seedlings which will be restocked until all the farmers are supplied.”
Acting Pomio District Rural Development Officer Wesley Palor said the cocoa production in the district is increasing and having the program will help boost production.
Palor said the farmers in the community will also be trained on nursery management practices, block lining and management, filling poly bags, shading and drainage.
Meanwhile, the Center of Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI) is also facilitating financial literacy training in the communities from the 16th to the 29th of June as part of the program."
PNG childhood educators acquire skills under PALM scheme,21/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4944,,Development,Trust,Nill,"A pilot program in the Northern Territory, Australia, is providing 14 childhood educators from Papua New Guinea opportunities to acquire new skills and enhance their existing qualifications.
The educators have been working at early childhood centres in the regional centres of Alice Springs and Katherine under the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme’s early childhood education and care (ECEC) pilot.
The ECEC pilot is part of the Australian Government’s commitment to tackling Australia’s workforce shortages in rural and regional areas. It also ensures workers develop long term skills and expertise that will strengthen the domestic labour markets back home.
The Papua New Guinean educators are graduating this month from a preparation program, which builds on their existing qualifications in early education to support their transition into an Australian workplace.
PALM scheme worker and educator, Shirley Mogi says the pilot provides the opportunity to build on existing experience in and knowledge of the sector.
“Here in Australia, you have something already set for the early childhood level, whereas for Papua New Guinea we have a lot of private schools, so everyone comes with their own philosophy, their own approach to early childhood.”
“We need human resources to go back and educate the young people of PNG and for Australia to be very welcoming to open their doors to accommodate. It’s a really big honour for us,” she said.
The educators will work in childcare centres for up to four years under the long-term stream of the PALM scheme.
There are currently over 2,000 PALM workers from PNG in Australia working in sectors including meat processing, agriculture, and aged care."
RISE builds female leaders in PNG,20/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4931,,Education,Joy,Nill,"Education is proving to be a powerful catalyst for social change as young women across Papua New Guinea (PNG) are being empowered through the RISE program — a mentoring and leadership initiative supported by City Pharmacy Limited (CPL) Foundation Inc.
The program, which began earlier this year, specifically targets Grade 11 and 12 students, guiding them through eight months of personal and professional development.
With workshops running monthly, the initiative pairs 20 students from Tokarara Secondary School with mentors who help them build career awareness, develop leadership skills, and prepare for tertiary education or employment.
RISE’s success is made possible through a strategic partnership with CPL Foundation Inc., led by Sir Mahesh Patel who believes that “the future is female.”
This partnership builds on CPL’s broader commitment to women’s empowerment in health, education, and economic opportunities.
“Our girls need to know they belong in boardrooms, businesses, and leadership roles,” Sir Mahesh said during the third workshop held last weekend.
The sessions have also featured inspiring speakers such as Dame Meg Taylor, Dr Cecilia Nembou, and Winnie Kiap —each bringing a wealth of experience and encouragement to the mentees.
These trailblazing women have shared real-world insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for young women in PNG.
For many participants, completing high school is an uphill battle, often made harder by societal expectations and economic hardship.
Programs like RISE not only provide guidance—they inspire resilience, confidence, and a belief in a brighter future.
Three workshops remain before the program’s graduation ceremony in October 2025."
Police to monitor highway following death,20/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4930,,Crime,Anger,Nill,"A twenty-five-year-old man of a mixed parentage of Goilala and East Sepik was murdered yesterday morning at Kuriva along the Hiritano Highway.
Angry relatives then set up a road block, preventing the flow of traffic along this section of the Highway.
Central Provincial Police Commander Chief Inspector Joseph Salle stated that Central police were notified of the roadblock attended to it.
The body of the deceased was then taken to his residential area at Panava Bridge along the Hiritano Highway.
""My officers had called on the relatives of the deceased to refrain from taking the law into their own hands, but must cooperate with the police to ensure that those involved face justice. I am also calling on the traveling public to take precautions when traveling along that section of the road. Police units will also be deployed along the highway to monitor the situation, Salle Said.
He also thanked his officers for their quick response, which led to no serious damage being done to other properties. He said the cause of death is still unknown.
Salle added that the police units on the ground conducted awareness for the people living along the highway, advising them not to block the road in future because it is a National Highway."
Growing concerns of drug smuggling into NCD,20/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4927,,Security,Fear,Nill,"Security agencies, airline companies, and customers are urged to work together to combat the illegal smuggling of cannabis through planes into Port Moresby, says Deputy Commissioner of Police Special Operations Donald Yamasombi.
Following reports of arrests and seizure of cannabis from different terminals at Jackson's International Airport, Yamasombi said this is now a significant security concern for the constabulary.
""If our airline companies are transporting marijuana from villages to Port Moresby, what guarantee will there be to transport it out of PNG to other countries? Our security companies, the airline companies, customs, and all the agencies must now work together to strengthen this. They are bringing the drug in larger quantities, as per reports received,"" DCP Yamasombi said.
He said last week, a couple and a taxi driver from Hela province were arrested and charged for having in their possession 13 kilograms of marijuana that came in from the Highlands region.
Recently, on Wednesday, about 10 kilograms of marijuana were brought in from Tapini on a Twin Hotter charter flight to Port Moresby. The marijuana was left unattended at the terminal when police arrived at the scene, but no one claimed the bags, which the police officers took to the Drug Squad office for destruction.
DCP Yamasombi further added that officers working at the airports and some of the police officers are involved in this activity.
He made reference to an incident on May 5th, 2025, where a large quantity of marijuana was brought in by Air Sanga that was at the terminal when police officers from the Drug Squad were tipped off.
They visited the scene and confirmed that more than five bags of drugs were left unattended at the terminal.
Police officers from the Drug Squad were investigating a previous case where some police officers from the Seven Mile Police Station were involved in conveying a huge amount of drugs that were never brought to the Drug Squad office for profiling and labeling as exhibits when they came across the May 5th incident.
Police investigations into the May 5th incident further led to the involvement of NAC officers.
On May 14th, 2025, NAC officers took eight marijuana bags to the Drug Squad office. According to sources, more than eight bags were removed at the airport but the NAC officers only brought in eight.
""Police officers are investigating that, and arrests will be made soon. This arrest will lead to the arrest of those who are party to the movement of these drugs. It had been happening in the past, and nothing had been done, so my officers will try their best to make sure they get all those involved charged.
If it means arresting the airline companies, it will happen because they failed to do proper checks before loading the goods. Port Moresby is now full of drug addicts because the authorities are participating in moving drugs to Port Moresby.
I want to commend the officers from the Drug Squad, NCD police, and all those who were involved in information gathering to build a case that will now be used to monitor the airline companies and other transport companies,” Yamasombi added."
PPCC pleased with Momase Communications inquiry,20/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4925,,Government,Anticipation,"Ricky Morris, Robert Naguri","The Permanent Parliamentary Committee on Communications began their regional inquiry with the Momase region in Madang Wednesday. The consultation concluded yesterday. The committee chaired by Marsh Narewec, member for Wau-Waria is open assisted by Ricky Morris, member for Alotau Open and Robert Naguri Bogia Open member.
They probed media organizations, stakeholders and the members of the public about challenges faced by media workers and explored ways to journalism education, regulation and professional practice. The inquiries aim to shape and promote responsible, ethical and quality journalism.
A decent crowd gathered at Divine Word University’s Sir Peter Barter Auditorium to participate in the first tour of the Permanent Parliamentary Committee on Communications in Madang. NBC Radio Station Manager for Madang, Macklay Bel, shared perspectives on misinformation and disinformation from the point of view of journalists in the province, and how the government can create and support policies which enable adequate training for journalists going into the workforce. A call was made for cadetship programs which was practiced in the past and the result was that the industry had more refined journalists.
In coping with technological advances and regulating online platforms the Provincial Police Commander Acting Superintendent Robert Baim and his team of officers were called to the panel to shed light on how they have been monitoring cybercrime within their jurisdiction. This included the process in which it took to get warrants to mobile phone companies to search for information and revert to police.
PPC Baim said, “There have been numerous reports on cybercrime in Madang, however, the challenges faced at the moment is getting to the next stage of arrests and prosecuting,” he said.
“Complainants usually settle out of court after reporting, which is out of our hands, resulting in the cases not proceeding onto the next stage.”
“There has to be a policy in place to prevent out of court settlements or tampering with suspects who have reported. Another major issue is getting necessary training for our cybercrimes officers,” the PPC stated.
The committee made a note of all these, to include in their recommendations to Parliament.
Two second year journalism students from Divine Word University were also invited to make presentations on awareness of cybercrime in schools and having it included in the curriculum in primary schools. The students and Mr Bel have been invited by the committee to travel to Port Moresby to properly present their submissions before the committee.
The PPCC Chairman said the inquiry was a success due to the significant feedback they received over the past two days. The committee now travels to Mission Resort in Jiwaka Province to hold the highlands leg of the consultation forum from June 22nd to 24th."
Drugs slip past airport security,19/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4916,,Crime,Trust,Nill,"A 57-year-old woman and two men from Tari, Hela Province were arrested yesterday in Port Moresby for having in possession eleven bags of wrapped marijuana weighing 13kg in the nation's capital.
They were caught while traveling in a taxi from Jackson Airport to their designated residence.
National Capital District Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab confirmed that the three are now in custody and will appear in court anytime this week.
According to the police brief, the three were sighted at the airport acting suspiciously, and the security guards quickly alerted the police when they got into the cab and drove out of the airport.
Superintendent Simatab said the security officers who tipped off the police also followed the taxi while communicating with the police.
Police personnel from the Vision City Cop Shop stopped and searched the taxi, confirming the presence of marijuana inside. He stated that the officers then brought the three individuals to the cop shop, where they were interrogated and confirmed that the marijuana belonged to them.
“I want to thank the security officers at the airport and the police officers at Vision City for their well-organized communication that led to the apprehension of the three. I want to see more of that from the private sector, especially security guards. When the public and the police work together, those criminal-minded people will not have a place in the community. When we are honest in our work, we will see such results in what we are doing daily,” Simatab said.
He also confirmed that people are bringing drugs from their respective provinces by plane, but get away because of poor coordination between the police and security at the airports. He said that with this arrest, it was well coordinated, and the command will want to see more of such arrests.
The three were charged under Section 63 (1) of the Controlled Substances Act 2021 for knowingly having in their possession eleven bags of wrapped marijuana."
Simbu LLG Election Preparation Faces Hurdles,19/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4917,,Politics,Fear,Nill,"As Simbu Province makes final preparations for the 2025 Local Level Government (LLG) Elections, with campaign activities in full swing, concerns have been raised about the availability of funds and resources to ensure the LLG elections are concluded successfully.
Election Manager of Chimbu Province, Reverend Tom Siune confirmed the province is ready for the electoral process, with nominated candidates currently undergoing an 11-week campaign period ahead of polling day set for July 12, 2025.
“Simbu is ready for the LLG elections, but we are struggling with funding and logistical support,” said Rev Siune.
“We have been asked to implement a mobile polling system, but without adequate resources, that will be very difficult.”
Rev Siune is now appealing to the Simbu Provincial Government and the six District Development Authorities (DDAs) to step in and assist with logistics and operational costs.
“If no support comes soon, we may be forced to cancel polling in some remote wards because we simply won't have the means to reach them,” he warned.
Among the highlights of the upcoming elections is the record number of 48 female candidates from Simbu, the highest in the Highlands region.
“We are proud to see this level of female participation,” said Anthonia Nilkare, one of the senior electoral officers overseeing activities across the province.
Electoral staff including Charlie Wangaid, Thomas Muabala, and James Dom continue their duties across the six districts to ensure that systems are in place ahead of July.
The electoral team remains hopeful that with timely local government support, the elections can proceed smoothly and all 351 wards will be reached on polling day.
There are 20 LLGs—18 rural and 2 urban—and 317 original ward areas in Simbu. Following a recent proclamation, 34 new wards have been added, bringing the total to 351. These newly declared wards are located primarily in Kundiawa-Gembogl, Chuave, Salt-Nomane, and Gumine districts."

Company representative Mindu Karu outlined a transformative plan that aims to boost sector productivity by 40% and create 15,000 jobs within five years.
The proposals include immediate government interventions such as a 50% input subsidy on quality animal feed, tax exemptions on imported breeding stock and veterinary supplies, and streamlined export processes with a 72-hour clearance system.
Long-term strategies involve establishing three regional meat and dairy processing hubs under public-private partnerships, coupled with five-year tax holidays to attract investment.

First-ever Resource Recovery Centre launched,18/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4913,,Development,Trust,John Rosso,"A new Resource Recovery Centre (the first of its kind in Papua New Guinea) will be built in Roku, on the outskirts of Port Moresby under a landmark partnership between Australia and TWM Group.
Australian High Commissioner, Mr Ewen McDonald joined Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, and others to break ground on the new Resource Recovery Centre.
Supported through the long-running Incentive Fund, the project, valued at PGK23.6 million (AUD10 million), will be delivered on a 50/50 cost-sharing basis between the Australian Government and TWM Group.
It marks the first time in the Incentive Fund’s 25-year history that the two governments have partnered directly with the private sector.
The project reflects a long-term commitment by TWM Group to deliver the nation’s first fully integrated waste management facility.
The addition of the Resource Recovery Centre will close the loop on its waste management system with a focus on prioritising the reuse, repurposing and recycling of waste - reserving safe disposal as a last resort.
Once operational the new facility will have the capacity to transform up to 40,000 tonnes of waste annually into economic opportunity and usable materials, including construction and demolition debris, plastics, and other recyclables.
It is expected to divert 70 to 80 per cent of this waste from landfill and will produce over 7,000 tonnes of recycled materials each year for reuse in infrastructure, agriculture, and manufacturing.
More than 20 green jobs will be created through the project, with a focus on employing women, young people, and people with disabilities.
The centre will also support green entrepreneurship and community participation through initiatives such as cash-for-scrap and local waste collection services.
This milestone project is part of Phase V of the Incentive Fund (2023–2031), a flagship PNG-Australia Partnership initiative that provides competitive grants for small-scale infrastructure valued between PGK3 million and PGK15 million.
The Incentive Fund is governed by a Board of five prominent Papua New Guinean directors, alongside the Secretary of the Department of National Planning and Monitoring and the Minister Counsellor for Economics, Health and Infrastructure of the Australian High Commission.
With a total investment of PGK406 million (AUD150 million), the current phase builds on more than two decades of partnership, during which over 80 projects have been delivered in every province of PNG.
This project represents a major step toward a cleaner, greener future for Papua New Guinea that’s also delivering jobs, innovation, and environmental sustainability in equal measure."

The NCD and Central Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi announced this through a press statement.
While welcoming him, Commander Turi also gave directives to all reservists in the command to report to him and identify themselves so the command can know who they are.
He said there are many police impersonators running around in the command who have been involved in illegal activities that have spoiled the good name of the constabulary.
“We have seen impersonators running around claiming to be police reservists who have been involved in illegal activities. With him coming into command, we want to see some changes. We also want to call on the trained reservists to report to him so he can assign them to a police station to work. You were trained and given the police uniform to serve the people. If you are not performing, then we have to take action and remove the uniform from you because the police uniform belongs to the police department,” Turi said.
Mr. Giusu will be based at the Saraga Police Post and will be coordinating the reservists in the command.
The Police Post will now be used as the operational center where all reservists will be in command."
Farmer acknowledges effort,17/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4904,,Agriculture,Trust,Nill,"A farmer and coordinator of youth cooperative societies for agriculture in Northern Province has expressed immense gratitude for the inclusion of farmers and villagers in high-end collaborative consultation workshops.
Livestock Development Corporation had a collective dialogue on Monday, June 16, with the Department of Agriculture and key stakeholders to gauge views and input, as well as challenges with existing data, which will contribute to the National Livestock Policy draft.
Alex Paumbari, a farmer, is representing five youth cooperative societies in the province and shared his appreciation during the final stakeholder consultative workshop in Port Moresby for the Southern region.
Paumbari acknowledged the initiative taken to create the policy framework, which he described as a beacon of light that will bring the livestock industry to greener pastures.
He added that this policy framework would tremendously contribute to providing better development strategies for the livestock industry and Papua New Guineans, especially farmers and villagers who make up 80 percent of PNG’s population, and who are heavily involved in livestock and subsistence farming.
Meanwhile, LDC Managing Director Terry Koim acknowledged all in attendance and shared how important each of them played a role as stakeholders in the development and growth of the livestock industry.
“LDC has been around for more than 40 years, first being created in 1982 with the mandate to generate revenue for the state by commercial beef cattle production through its ranches and abattoir; however, in September 2014, LDC’s remaining ranches and abattoirs were shut down by the then government of the day.
LDC was parked as a program under the then Department of Agriculture and Livestock (DAL), now Department of Agriculture (DoA), from 2014 to 2019”, he said.
LDC in collaboration with the Agriculture Department, will now be preparing for the validation process of this first ever livestock policy framework in July 2025. This draft policy will then be tabled before the NEC for approval and further action."
Australia proud to support future leaders,17/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4900,,Education,Joy,Nill,"The Australian National University-University of Papua New Guinea (ANU-UPNG) partnership is helping to nurture the next generation of young minds from across PNG.
Issabelle Vilau is among a group of talented students who have benefited from Australian Government support to pursue their dream of achieving academic excellence. For Issabelle Vilau, graduating with a Master of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) was the fulfillment of a lifelong goal.
She says the knowledge and skills she has gained in completing her Masters Degree has enhanced her ability to teach Public Policy Management at UPNG’s School of Business and Public Policy (SBPP).
“These students are going to go back to wherever they are from, whether in Port Moresby, their provinces, or districts, and in whatever capacity they have, they can contribute to development.
“If I can make even just a small change in their mindset or their perspective or just help them in whatever capacity that I can, that would be satisfying,” says Issabelle.
Another beneficiary of the ANU-UPNG partnership is Wilba David Bossin. Wilba received the Dean’s award from SBPP while graduating with a Bachelor of Economics.
Wilba attributes his success to engagement and interaction with fellow students, his lecturers - including ANU Professor Stephen Howes - and staff at the ANU Summer School.
“As a student, the ANU-UPNG Partnership was helpful,” Wilba says.
“We received technical support from people who were far better and more qualified than we, but willing to be patient with us,” Wilba added.
Since its inception in 2012, the UPNG-ANU Partnership has driven rapid growth in economic inquiry and research. Since 2015, enrollments at SBPP have jumped from fewer than 200 students to around 1200.
While the number of courses taught has increased from 5 to 25. Under the partnership, 10 UPNG economic graduates have been awarded scholarships to undertake master's studies at ANU, and all have returned to teaching positions at UPNG."
SEZs to improve country’s standing,17/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4891,,Business,Anticipation,"James Marape, Richard Maru","The launch of the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Foundation Policy will enable the government to forge opportunities to improve the country's standings, including employment.
Prime Minister James Marape when launching the Policy on Sunday June 15 at the APEC Haus, said this creates a new era of renewed hope for economic growth and prosperity for the next 50 years.
He said the government places a high priority on development around the country as the vehicle to practically promote economic diversification, industrialisation, and rural development.
Minister Marape said SEZs, once fully operational, will support the government’s high-level national development aspirations, as contained in the Medium-Term Development Plan (MTDP)IV and beyond, to raise the economy to K200 million.
Minister for International Trade & Investment, Richard Maru, was thankful and honored to stand by the Prime Minister yesterday to present PNG’s first ever comprehensive Special Economic Zones Foundation Policy 2025-2032 before PNG’s 50th Golden Jubilee Year falls on the 16th September 2025.
“PNG is the last frontier to industrialisation, envied by lucrative investors for the vast natural resources to attract multi-million-kina investments to create wealth, grow the economy, create millions of jobs, and improve the quality of life for all Papua New Guineans,” Minister Maru said.
“We commend the Marape-Roso Gov’t for its vision and leadership in advancing this initiative, especially when the country is facing significant economic challenges.
He said, despite having world-class resource projects in the extractive sector, the economy is struggling with high levels of unemployment, crime, national debt, and a foreign currency rationing crisis.
Minister Maru said he was happy that the PM has come up with a new 20-year development Plan, and SEZ will be the key to this plan going forward.
SEZ is the best Government option as we can be inspired by the rapidly industrialized Southeast Asian countries like China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, which have effectively developed numerous SEZs as their primary economic driver that are transforming their struggling nations into economic prosperity and middle-income countries in this century."
Guinness clocks in 50 years of service,17/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4895,,Profile,Trust,Nill,"While the country anticipates to celebrating the Golden Anniversary of the nation, Commander for Northern Command, Assistant Commissioner of Police Peter Guinness, recently celebrated 50 years of service with the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
He was attested as a policeman on April 11, 1975, at the Bomana Police College.
ACP Peter Guinness joined the RPNGC at the tender age of 16. Guinness, who hails from Biwat in the Angoram District of East Sepik Province, had always looked up to his father, who was a policeman back in the day.
At only seven years of age, Guinness had already set his mind and heart to becoming a police officer one day.
“My father was a Senior Constable at that time, and he was my mentor, and I always wanted to become a policeman just like him,” says Guinness.
Just like most policeman’s kid, Guinness was born and grew up in another province away from home, where his father was serving. He was born in Kaiapit, a station in the Morobe Province and later his father got transferred to Manus Province where he spent his childhood growing up in the little Island province.
It was late 1974, Papua New Guinea was still under the Australian Government, but the whispers about gaining Independence became louder and echoed in every corner of the country. A lot of indigenous people did not fully understand what it was, and what it would bring. Some said there would be no services and no jobs as Australians would leave the country with all that they brought with them.
“I was convinced that when the white men leave PNG and return to their country, most of the jobs created will not be there anymore, and I will waste my time going to school, and when I finish school, I will have nothing to do,” Guinness recalled.
He was in grade nine at that time, and these rumours made him lose hope of continuing his education. Initially, he wanted to join the army and was about to sit for the interview when his mom disagreed with the idea of his joining the army. Later that year, there was a callout for anyone interested to join the Police Force, and without a second thought, young Guinness gave it a shot.
“Even though I always wanted to be a policeman, I still didn’t think I would get accepted into Police Training,” Guinness humbly said.
Guinness, like every other small-town boy, had a bicycle that he would ride around the little laid-back town and come home in the evenings for a bath and dinner or when Mama’s calling for him. One afternoon, it was a little different. he came home on his bike after a ride to the beach, to a very quiet mom, which was unusual for a Sepik mother. Worried about what went wrong, he approached his mom. She looked at him and, with a sad face, told him the good news of his life.
Little did she know that what she presumed to be her sad news would have a golden celebration 50 years later.
“I was very excited that I will be going for Police Training but unfortunately my parents didn’t have enough to pay for my necessities before leaving so I sold my bicycle and bought them and that was the start of my Police Journey,” a curvy smile escaped his face as he recalled this.
50 years on and Guinness, with the same love for his job as he had when he first joined the organisation, was given a front seat at the Lae Yacht Club to be celebrated for his dedication and loyalty in serving the country.
He sat with a humble smile pasted across his face all throughout as his colleagues, families, and friends took turns to speak about his achievements, mentorship, and invaluable contributions to their lives as well as the organisation.
Present at the occasion were the Metropolitan Superintendent for Lae Metro, Provincial Police Commanders for Morobe, Eastern Highlands, Madang and Simbu provinces, Australian Federal Police members, colleagues, friends, and families of Mr Guinness who came with gifts and speeches to celebrate this achievement.
It was an emotional moment for some as they recalled how selfless, dedicated, and supportive he was as a leader, colleague, father, and a good friend. His love for his job extended to the way he portrayed himself around his family, friends, and the communities he lived in.
In comparing his experiences and views of the Constabulary before and after Independence, he said the Police Force before Independence was very disciplined but lost most of its core values after Independence.
“Before Independence, the Police Force was operating very well, the organisation was running perfectly and smoothly and even after independence in 1975 and up but as the years go by the operation of the RPNGC started to deteriorate because the government at that time did not look at Police Force as an organisation that needs support.
” The Police Force is not a moneymaking organisation and the lack of commitment from the government to improve the organization allowed it to disintegrate,” Guinness stressed.
He said the government at that time did not consider the pressing issues of the police force, especially on refurbishing and rebuilding the police barracks and police stations and providing vehicles to ease their jobs. This has resulted in a decline in the performance of the members due to a lack of moral support from the government.
He said the welfare of an officer is important, but with less attention given to this, over time, discipline gradually erodes. He also said command and control is not there, and that is very concerning as a longtime and loyal member of the Force.
“A way to bring back the culture and system of this organisation is to regenerate enthusiasm.
“I am happy that the problem that has been here for so long is currently being looked at by the Commissioner of the day. This is not his problem nor a problem that he created, but it has been here over time, and every step taken to improve the operation of the Constabulary is good,” Guinness said.
He also stressed the breakdown of discipline in the force. He said in the past, there was no such thing as having extended families living in the barracks, which seems to be a practice today. Everything starts from where a person lives and comes out for work each day, and if they are treating the barracks like another settlement, it will show in their attitude towards work as well. One thing he wished to see revived is the level of discipline in the Force.
For Guinness to come this far in his career journey is not only an achievement for himself but for the organisation and his family too. Every successful person always has an untold story of the obstacles and setbacks that came as part of life.
Guinness was no different; he had a roller-coaster life in his private life. His personal life was not as he wanted it to be, but through the storms came fifteen beautiful children and ten grandchildren who became his pillar of strength.
Fifty years of serving the Police Force would mean hundreds of encounters, experiences, and achievements but Guinness said one of which that stood out for him was climbing to the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police.
“Never in my dreams had I thought I’d wear the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police one day, but I am wearing the ACP rank because of sheer hard work that had prompted me to become the person that I am today” Guinness said.
When asked about the so many experiences he had and if there’s one he’d like to share, Guinness smiled and said being a police officer is a job that you will have so many encounters and a lot to tell but he has always held onto the moments when he was faced with life-threatening situations and how he led his men to overcome these situations, but there were also moments where he lost his policemen during their lines of duty.
“I’ve shared pain and tears with families and loved ones of my men, but we had to keep going because we swore an oath to serve and protect lives and properties. His smile faded as he flashed back on those tragic moments.
“At the end of the day, it was through all these experiences that built me over time that I was able to make rational and critical decisions and to come out on top,” he said.
He thanked the Constabulary for all the recognition of his work in having him promoted up the rank and file to where he is now. Apart from his promotions, he was also awarded a Distinguished Police Service Medal, Queen’s Police Medal, and a British Empire Medal.
With all the awards, promotions, and experiences Guinness has, he also holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Public Policy Management, which he obtained at the University of Papua New Guinea, and got his Master’s in Public Administration at the Divine Word University.
Guinness loved his job as a policeman. To him, it wasn’t just a job he applied to become, but a job he had dreamt of becoming since he was seven. He said being a policeman is a dream come true and a motivation in life."
Kas calls for resettlement of Manam islanders,17/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4894,,Politics,Anticipation,Jim Kas,"The launch of the Manam Resettlement Authority’s machines for a resettlement exercise was received with a challenge by former Madang governor, Jim Kas, who called for the immediate resettlement of Manam islanders.
Kas raised his concern at the Bogia station during the launch of Manam Resettlement Authority’s new machines for the development of Andarum for the displaced people of Manam Island.
He said the government needs to focus more on getting the people of Manam resettled before another disaster strikes. He said the government project is long overdue, for various reasons, but the people need to be resettled immediately.
Kas stated that Karkar Island is also a volcanic island, currently dormant; however, there have been several minor rumblings since its last eruption in 2013 and the deadliest in 1974, which killed two volcanologists.
“Sapos yu delay long Manam project igo, na what if Karkar Island emi blow tomorrow? Manam has 20,000 people while Karkar has over 100,000 people. How do you deal with that? That is the reason why the Manam Resettlement Bill must be passed, with Karkar in mind and also other districts who might face internal displacements,” said Kas.
Kas is adamant that the government resettle the Manam Islanders in preparation for any other scenarios where Internally Displaced Persons may arise. Not only for Karkar Island, however, he said there is new evidence of people in the lower Bundi area who are currently affected by the activities of the Kurumbukari mine.
Kas, in his term as governor (2012-2017), created the Manam Resettlement Bill to enable the government to create the Manam Resettlement Authority, tasked to resettle displaced Manam Islanders before 2030."
Prisoners bash alleged rapist,17/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4903,,Crime,Anger,Nill,"Angry prisoners at the Bomana Correctional Service have beaten up alleged rapist Danny Karayo for committing another crime while on parole.
Karayo was charged with sexual penetration and was sentenced in 2012 for 14 years, eight months and three weeks before he came out on parole and returned to the police force without authorization of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary. Hence, the constabulary is now investigating this.
Due to the sensitivity of their matter, the prisoners were frustrated and not only beat Karayo but also his co-accused Jerry Aura as well.
Acting Correctional Services Commissioner Bernard Nepo clarified social media rumors stating that the prisoners fought the alleged rapist and not the Correctional Service officers.
“The prisoners were frustrated because he was released on parole and committed another crime, that’s why they beat him and his other co-accused.
“His normal date of release is 2027, but now that he has committed another crime, he will be serving additional years. It certainly depends on the outcome of his case,” Nepo added.
Karayo, and co-accused Aura and Carl Yori were arrested and charged with Deprivation of Liberty, and Rape for allegedly rapping 22-year-old woman at the Saraga police post on June 3 2025.
They appeared before the Waigani District Court on Tuesday, June 10th for arraignment.
During their court hearing, Karayo made several attempts through oral application, requesting the presiding Magistrate, Albert Daniels, to remand him and his co-accused at the Boroko Holding Cell.
However, Magistrate Daniels refuse his application stating that the Boroko Holding Cell keeps perpetrators who are awaiting court for their first appearance, and when their matter is heard in court, they are required to be remanded at the Bomana prison."

“This is our country; we wear this uniform to protect the sovereignty of this country. Nobody will do it for us. We will do it,” Rear Admiral Polewara said.

PNGFA welcomes Forest Finance Programme,16/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4880,,Environment,Anticipation,Nill,"PNG Forest Authority officials have recently met with key development partners, including the European Union and senior government officers.
During the discussion, Managing Director John Mosoro expressed that the PNG Forest Authority (PNGFA) is keen to participate in the European Union Climate Change and Biodiversity Programme (EU-CCBP) on Forest Finance.
Mr Mosoro welcomed the Forest Finance programme, describing it as exciting and the first of its kind in PNG.
“Our country has the highest Forest species composition and is rich in biodiversity; therefore, I request and welcome the European Union and all our development partners to carefully assess our Forest landscape and mobilize Forest finance towards the future development of the country,” MD Mosoro said.
Mr Mosoro made his opening remarks last Thursday, June 12 at the “Financing for Forests” workshop sponsored by the European Union’s Climate Change and Biodiversity Programme at the Crown Residence.
“It is a pleasure and honor to welcome you to this important workshop on Forest Finance in PNG. It is an exciting programme and the first of its kind in PNG, “he told key participants comprising partner agencies and key government agencies.
“I must also acknowledge the EU European Union for their ongoing support to our Forest sector, from the development of our national forest inventory to the EU-FCCB programme and work under this current scoping study, “Mr. Mosoro said.
PNGFA commended the EU to support the Government in four thematic programs,
1. Reform and reorganisation of PNGFA Organisation Structure,
2. Mobilisation of Forest finance and Forest Carbon Accounting,
3. Downstream processing and international log export price determination and
4. Upgrade of ICT in PNGFA.
Mr Mosoro emphasised that forests are the heart of the nation and the lungs of world.
“They cover 78 per cent of our land, Harbour exceptional biodiversity and support the livelihoods and identities of millions of our citizens.
“The timber industry has been a foundational part of PNG’s economy since independence and provided a key national income as well as delivering infrastructure to our rural communities.
“As we approach our 50 years of Independence, we must ensure our Forest sector continues to play a key role in the economy and deliver for our people.
“For many years, Forest finance in the country had been defined primarily by timber extraction and export to generate revenue. While this has contributed to national income and rural employment, we also recognised the urgent need to diversify and modernise our approach towards the other Forest ecosystem benefits to promote a green economy within the forestry sector.
The Forest resources are rich with high economic value, but have not been researched to define their true value.
‘As you are aware government has made a policy to ban all round export by the end of this year. The Government has shifted to downstream processing through a sustainable Forest Management system; therefore, it would request a Green Finance investment system.
He said PNGFA was committed to working in close collaboration with its national counterparts, including the Climate Change Authority, the Treasury and others, as well as international and local partners to achieve these goals.
“Our government, through PNGFA, has set important targets to develop Forest plantations and support downstream processing, promote reforestation and afforestation in the country that may be considered for Forest Finance.
“These work in line with our partner agencies, also ensure that our most valuable diversity is conserved in an enhanced protected area network and that our forests form a key part of the global fight on climate change,” Mr Mosoro said."

Polio vaccines arrive,14/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4861,,Health,Trust,Elias Kapavore,"Life-saving polio vaccines arrive in PNG to protect the nation’s future Emergency immunisation campaign to reach 3 million children under 10 as national polio response ramps up
The fight against polio in PNG is moving ahead with the arrival of more than 4.6 million life-saving vaccine doses to kickstart a nationwide immunisation campaign.
The shipment of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) touched down in the capital Port Moresby in the early hours of Friday, 13 June 2025.
The first round of emergency vaccinations will now be launched to stop the spread of poliovirus.
With a second shipment scheduled for July, health authorities aim to vaccinate every child under 10 years of age — nearly 3 million children in total.
The intensive two-round campaign is supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and the Australian Government.
The vaccine delivery comes just weeks after PNG declared a national health emergency. Circulating poliovirus was detected in environmental samples and healthy children.
“This is an urgent race to protect our children and stop the virus in its tracks,” said Dr Veera Mendonca, UNICEF Papua New Guinea Representative. “The arrival of these vaccines is a vital first step. Now we need to get them to every child.”
Recognising the seriousness of the situation, Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea H.E. Ewen McDonald said his country was pleased to provide an immediate contribution of AUD 5 million to support PNG’s response.
“Our funding will help deliver an integrated vaccination campaign, combining polio vaccines with other routine childhood immunisations — to give children across PNG the best possible start in life. The arrival in Port Moresby today (yesterday) of a large shipment of polio vaccines is an important milestone.”
Mr McDonald said Australia would continue to work with PNG to protect children, reduce the risk of future outbreaks, and support a healthier, more resilient region.
The vaccines will be distributed across the country in the coming weeks. Health workers will be deployed by air, foot, boat, helicopter and vehicle to reach children in even the most remote villages.
PNG had been polio-free for 25 years until a previous outbreak in 2018. The current outbreak was detected in April and May through environmental surveillance in Morobe Province and Port Moresby.
No cases of paralysis have been reported. The detection of the virus in environmental samples and healthy children shows why vaccination is urgently needed to protect all children.
“Routine immunisation coverage is still too low in many areas, putting children at real risk,” said Dr Mendonca. “This outbreak is a wake-up call. We must act now — by strengthening routine immunisation and tackling the polio outbreak — to protect our children and prevent this from happening again.”
UNICEF, WHO and the Australian Government are working with the National Department of Health. The partners are supporting the campaign with vaccines, cold chain equipment, transport, training, operational costs, communication and community engagement.
“We need all hands on deck to stop this outbreak as quickly as possible,” said Dr Sevil Huseynova, WHO Representative in Papua New Guinea. “Polio is a preventable disease, and vaccines are our most powerful tool. The arrival of this first shipment of vaccines is an important milestone. We urge all parents and caregivers to bring their children for vaccination — this is the best way to keep them safe.”
Health Minister Elias Kapavore said the government was fully committed to protecting every child in Papua New Guinea from polio.
“This vaccination campaign is a vital part of our national emergency response. We are calling on all health workers, provincial health authorities, community leaders and families to join forces and ensure that no child is left behind.

Morobe polling officials petition EC,14/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4862,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"Polling officials in Morobe have given the Electoral Commission 10 days to reinstate all polling teams or they will stand down from conducting local level government (LLG) elections in the province.
Returning officer for the Kabwum by-election, supported by the province’s assistant returning officers, presented their petition this morning (Friday, June 13th) to the Morobe Provincial Election Advisory Committee (PEAC).
A decision was made last week by the PNG Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai, to have only two polling teams per local level government, to conduct the LLG elections.
Morobe, the province with the largest land mass in the country, has 39 LLGs in its 10 districts, and 424 polling teams to ensure LLG elections are conducted within the given timeframe. The initial number of polling officials for Morobe was set at 2,968.
Kabwum by-election Returning Officer, James Neapukali, presented their concerns to the Morobe Provincial Election Advisory Committee at the disaster office in Lae.
Neapukali, who was the former Finschhafen district administrator, outlined that reducing the number of polling teams to only two per LLG may compromise the ability to cover all polling stations adequately. This can potentially lead to delays, incomplete polling, or other irregularities that could undermine the integrity of the election.
“Before going into actual polling that is four weeks away – 12 July we should start – and having experience in past elections; this period is for us to prepare for polling,” Neapukali stated. “But actually, we have not done that yet, showing that bad things are going to happen, maybe due to the issue of funding not being made available on time.”
Neapukali used the LLG of Wain-Erap, Nawaeb district, as an example, saying while it has 18 wards, only two polling teams are expected to cover the area, which is one of the most hard-to-reach districts in Morobe; similar to the other eight rural districts – excluding Lae.
“Then the Electoral Commission directed us and suspended all the polling locations and only left two, there will definitely be a problem,” Neapukali continued.
“That’s why, we AROs and myself, as RO, we do this petition and we are not accepting this call. We petition EC to reinstate all the gazetted polling areas. If you do not comply to our petition, then we AROs and myself – RO – we will stand down from work. We will not risk our lives.”
Wampar ARO, Kamis Connery, voiced their support, highlighting that they are the ones who will be on ground to run the election, and they do not want a repetition of the destruction that was caused during the 2022 national general elections.
Their petition was received by the provincial election manager, Simon Soheke, in the presence of the committee’s deputy chairman and Lae City Authority chief executive officer, Robin Calistus, and provincial disaster coordinator, Charlie Masange.
The petitions were copied to the PEAC chairman, Kissu Lucas, provincial administrator, Max Bruten, provincial human resource manager, Kusak Meluk, operations manager Momase PNG Electoral Commission, Bura Maro, PNGEC director operations, Margret Vagi and the Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai."
DPM Rosso impressed with Kumul23 Training,14/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4867,,Security,Trust,John Rosso,"Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso and Commissioner of Police, David Manning, inspected the continuing training of the RPNGC Police Tactical Group, KUMUL23, this week at a training facility.
The inspection included a demonstration of advanced use of force, rapid methods of entry, drone capabilities and night vision equipment used in the development of the Police Tactical Group.
The RPNGC Police Tactical Group, KUMUL23, is undergoing extensive training to provide the RPNGC with a professional tactical capacity to neutralise domestic terrorists and other violent criminals and respond to highly volatile operational requirements.
“I am impressed with the tactical capabilities and intelligence gathering capability of KUMUL23 to track down and neutralise the domestic terrorist threat,” Deputy Prime Minister Rosso said after the demonstration of force.
“This is a much-needed capability, that aligns with the Marape-Rosso Government’s strategic approach to improving law and order outcomes.
“The Commissioner of Police called for expert skills to respond to those who terrorise our communities. This Government has listened and is responding.
“I am proud to see KUMUL23 in action and witness their emerging capabilities firsthand.
“Under the direction of Commissioner Manning, this elite tactical unit has been established and is being trained to the highest global security standard.
“Recruitment into KUMUL23 is from within the Police Force especially the Special Services Division.
“All members of KUMUL23 will continue to undergo intensive physical and psychological screening as part of training before being deployed on active operations.”
Commissioner Manning said the specifics of the KUMUL23 training and rollout is classified due to the relevant National security elements of the capability, though the public will be made aware of these capabilities where appropriate.
“Advanced tactical training of this nature does not happen overnight, and we are investing in professional, well-trained members who can competently meet the challenges of our most volatile regions and incidents.
“Tactical training currently underway is supported by the latest technology and intelligence capabilities, including use of drones and night vision equipment. This training will ensure a level of regional interoperability that the RPNGC has not previously had.
“This is the first time PNG has developed and trained an advanced tactical group of this level. It is intensive, both physically and mentally.
“This includes 20-kilometre pack marches each day, significant training in use of force operations, and training on intelligence-led policing operations to counter the most serious threats to our community safety.
“The KUMUL23 personnel are living and operating as an elite team where they have full trust in each other and interoperate seamlessly to deliver targeted tactical outcomes.
“This specialist capability is what we need to fight organised crime, warlords and other people who seek to destroy our country to build their personal wealth.
“I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for inspecting our KUMUL23 capability as this training progresses. The support of Government has been critical in ensuring that the RPNGC continue to develop capabilities that meet the modern law and order environment.”
The training of KUMUL23 personnel is being undertaken at police facilities around the country with new intakes of personnel to take place in the coming months.
Further information on the development of the KUMUL23 Police Tactical Group will be released at an appropriate time."
Nature Park Celebrates 13 Years,14/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4860,,Local,Joy,Nill,"The Port Moresby Nature Park has proudly marked its 13th anniversary, celebrating over a decade of conservation, education, and community engagement in Papua New Guinea.
A commemorative event was held on Thursday, June 12th, bringing together staff, sponsors, and supporters to reflect on the park’s remarkable journey and achievements since opening its gates in 2012.
The day began with the launch of the “Naturelympics” — a light-hearted internal challenge where staff members from different departments competed in games and team-building activities, reinforcing the spirit of unity and collaboration that defines the park's operations.
Chief Executive Officer Johnpaul Houston delivered a heartfelt message of gratitude, acknowledging the ongoing support from donors, board members, and the public.

Government provides K4m freight subsidy for cocoa farmers,14/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4866,,Government,Trust,Nill,"The Government through the Department of National Planning and Monitoring (DNPM) has stepped in to assist farmers in rural areas to transport their produce to markets.
Secretary for the Department of National Planning and Monitoring, Koney Samuel presented a funding support of K4 million to the Cocoa Board of Papua New Guinea (PNG) Chief Executive Officer, Jesse Anjen during a small ceremony in Kokopo on Friday 13 June 2025.
Secretary Samuel said the funding support is an illustration of the National Government’s determination and commitment to strengthen efforts to build and expand the cocoa industry, particularly in remote and rural areas where transport remains a major challenge.
“It has been difficult for our farmers over many years and although we have been running Freight Programs for Coffee and Cocoa farmers, this has been insufficient. With this support now, they can do a lot more in terms of reaching out to our farmers in the rural areas and bringing those produce to the markets,” Mr Samuel said.
The funding is provided under the Capital Investment Program, specifically through the Freight Subsidy Program, managed by the DNPM for commodity boards such as the Cocoa Board and the Coffee Industry Corporation (CIC).
Cocoa Board CEO, Jesse Anjen welcomed the funding, describing it as timely and impactful.
“I thank the Marape-Rosso Government for being a strong advocate of the agriculture sector and recognizing that it is key driver for economic growth. Our goal is to grow the cocoa industry into a K4 billion sector. One of our key initiatives, the Cocoa Freight Program, has already proven its worth. A previous investment of K22 million under the program has generated over K164 million in returns. This is one of the success stories we have had from the Freight Program,” Mr. Anjen said.
He explained that the Freight Program not only reduces transport cost for farmers but also supports infrastructure development.
“We are establishing storage facilities at key points along the value chain to help consolidate produce for shipping or air transport. This additional K4 million will allow us to continue expanding these services in remote areas,” Mr. Anjen said.
Secretary Samuel’s visit to the East New Britain Province is part of the 2025 Inter-departmental Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Exercise which has been carried out around the country for 3 weeks. The M&E Exercise is designed to track the impact of Public Investment Program (PIP) funding from 2022 to 2024.
The M&E exercise includes four key government agencies including the Departments of Treasury, Finance, Provincial and Local Government Affairs (DPLGA), and Implementation and Rural Development (DIRD)—who are partnering with DNPM in this coordinated national initiative."

Baim said such incidents will not longer be treated as minor misconduct or school mischief, but will be classified as serious criminal offenses.

This stern warning comes following the alarming increase in student related violence, particularly inter-school clashes that have begun to threaten public safety and hinder the learning environment. He said there will be immediate legal action, arrest and prosecution.
To combat this trend, police will be increasing patrols around school zones, public transportation hubs and popular gathering spots for students. The aim is to respond promptly to signs of disorder or violence.
Baim also called on parents, guardians and school authorities to play an active role in preventing further violence. He urged them to speak with their children and students, stressing that the issue cannot be handled by law enforcement alone.
“This is a collective responsibility. We all need to play our part. Enough is enough,” he emphasized.
Baim emphasized that safeguarding the future of Madang’s youth depends on everyone working together to create a safe, conducive environment for learning and growth."

Pilot Jailed for Drug Smuggling,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4854,,Crime,Trust,Nill,"Deputy Commissioner of Police – Special Operations, Donald Yamasombi, has expressed satisfaction over the outcome of an Australian Supreme Court ruling that saw a convicted drug smuggler sentenced to 11 years in prison.
The ruling, handed down on Wednesday, June 11, 2025, concluded the high-profile case involving 54-year-old Benard Hamilton Alexander, who was arrested for smuggling 56 kilograms of methamphetamine from Papua New Guinea into Australia on March 21, 2023.
Alexander had initially pleaded not guilty and maintained that stance throughout multiple court appearances. However, in a surprising turn of events, he changed his plea to guilty shortly before Yamasombi and another investigator were scheduled to testify via video link.
“With that conviction and sentencing, I want to thank all the officers involved in the investigation,” said Yamasombi. “That includes those who provided intelligence information that led to the arrests, and our counterparts from the Australian Federal Police who worked alongside us.”
He added that while he was prepared to give evidence in court, the sudden plea change meant his testimony was no longer needed. “I was ready and waiting for the moment to take the stand, but I’m happy that justice was served regardless,” he said.
The investigation began with a joint operation in Bulolo, Morobe Province, where authorities apprehended two Asian nationals and six Papua New Guineans in relation to the drug smuggling attempt. All eight were subsequently charged and appeared before the courts in PNG.
Yamasombi highlighted the importance of international collaboration in cross-border crime and praised officers from Lae, Port Moresby, and other regions for their efforts.
The case marks a significant milestone in ongoing efforts to combat transnational drug trafficking between PNG and Australia."

Monitoring compliance a challenge,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4856,,Business,Fear,Nill,"The Internal Revenue Commission and the Independent Consumer & Competition Commissioner gave an update on the challenges faced during the two weeks of implementing the GST Zero rated measure that was applied to 13 essential store goods.
IRC Commissioner General Sam Koim said this is the first time there was ever a tax relief, therefore IRC is learning a lot in this process.
“In terms of shop owners, while appearing to be removing the GST also, they then inflate the actual price ahead. And these are kind of challenges, especially in the monitoring of the compliance,” he said. “Those are the challenges that we'll be facing.”
“There’s a lot of revenue at stake as well. If we do not administer this properly, then a lot of shop owners might not pass relief to the ultimate consumer. So might appear to be and also stocking up GST zero rated stock for future or something like that.”
From the tax perspective, the retail sector has been challenging to administer and manage resulting in the IRC’s inability to correctly audit, assess and penalize non-compliant taxpayers. The consequence has been the reduction and loss in the overall tax revenue, a drop-in tax compliance, a non-disclosure of revenue specifically and directly in affecting GST with added costs passed on to the ultimate consumers.
“There's a lot of challenges we anticipate, but we also preparing at the same time. It's just that we don't have the digital tools that we anticipated to have it to enable us to do this. But be it as it may, we are actually preparing to do the manual enforcements, and that's why we are forging this relationship with ICCC and customs, especially the goods that are hitting our shores at the ports will also be zero rated from that point onwards. That's ideally, we'd like to do, it's passed on until it is ultimately benefiting the consumer,” Koim said.
Commissioner ICCC, Paulus Ain gave an update on how many business houses have already been caught and are in court for not complying with the government’s policy on the GST zero-rated goods.
Ain said, “Business houses need to cooperate with us it is a policy and all of us must work together in the interest of this country.”
“After being out and about we have been given a run around by businesses houses, about 159 are currently in court.
“We are aware of who you are, business communities work with us and the 13 items must be zero-rated.
“To consumers, do not expect IRC and ICCC to do the hard yards, you are at the shops every day. If you see some diversions and you are suspicious go to our offices in the provinces,” Ain said.
Koim stated retailers found in breach of the changes in law will be severely dealt with through the imposition of the following measures 1. Administrative penalties for non-compliance; 2.
Recovery of amounts wrongly collected 3. Suspension and cancelation of GST registration and 4. Prosecution under section 95 (1) (f) (i) (ii) (iii) (40) (4) (a) (b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 2003."
MV Scorpio Marks a New Era for Sumkar,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4855,,Government,Trust,Alexander Suguman Orme,"Member for Sumkar and Vice Minister for Petroleum, Alexander Suguman Orme, this week welcomed the arrival of MV Scorpio, a newly acquired landing vessel purchased by the Sumkar District Development Authority (DDA) to enhance sea transport and service delivery across the district.
MV Scorpio successfully completed its maiden voyage, sailing from Port Moresby to Alotau, and arriving in Madang on the 08th of this month. Under the leadership of Captain Tom Maob and a two-man crew, the vessel departed Port Moresby on Saturday, 31st May.
The vessel was purchased at a cost of K1.3 million from Lamana Development Corporation, demonstrating Sumkar DDA’s commitment in investing in essential infrastructure for the benefit of its communities and to progressively build the districts internal revenue.
“The MV Scorpio is more than just a vessel — it represents our vision for improved connectivity, reliable service delivery, and economic empowerment for our people,” said Alexander Suguman Orme during the welcoming ceremony. “I commend the DDA, Lamana Development Corporation, and all involved for making this project a reality.”
MV Scorpio is capable of carrying both cargo and passengers and will be vital in transporting medical supplies, school materials, building resources, and economic goods to remote coastal and island communities within the Sumkar District and even outside depending on the partners and stakeholders who are interested to hire the vessel. Its acquisition is a major boost to the DDA’s efforts in strengthening local infrastructure, particularly in remote and underserved areas that depend heavily on maritime transport.
With over 150, 000 population on Karkar and Bagabag Islands, people rely heavily on marine transportation to conduct businesses, purchase goods and access services. The small outboard motors have a limited capacity in transporting commuters and in most instances during rough and windy weather, cargo end up at the bottom of the ocean when the small crafts capsized. With the inclusion of this vessel, it will enable better passage for the islanders.
Mr. Orme emphasized the importance of such strategic investments in enabling government services to reach every corner of the district and ensure that no community is left behind."

Mobile police barracks to be constructed,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4845,,Local,Trust,Ramsey Pariwa,"Madang Province will soon have its own mobile police barracks.
This follows the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea (ELCPNG) and the Madang Provincial Government.
ELCPNG secretary, Bernard Kaisom, and acting Madang provincial administrator, Daniel Aloi, signed the MoU on May 26th at the Madang Provincial Government office, witnessed by officers from ELCPNG, the Madang Provincial Police Command, the Madang Provincial Government and Administration.
The MoU is to allow the Madang Provincial Government to develop Asuar land portion 848 for the construction of the Madang mobile police barracks, which is worth K15 million.
Madang acting provincial police commander, Superintendent Robert Baim, was relieved that the signing took place and stated that this now paves the way for work to begin on the 40-man police barracks project.
Baim said this project is funded by the Department of National Planning and Monitoring, and should have commenced last year, but due to administrative issues and political tussles, it was delayed to this year.
He outlined that the project will improve police manpower to address law and order issues in the province, adding that many times he has had to request mobile police units from other provinces to assist local police in their duties.
“I want to thank ELCPNG for seeing our need and making land available to support police projects in Madang,” he stated.
“When this barracks is completed, it will complement our community policing unit program, and we can attend to law and order issues accordingly.”
Baim said the national government has made a payment of K5 million to start this project, so an additional K10 million will be paid later to ensure the project is completed.
He thanked Madang Governor, Ramsey Pariwa, and the provincial executive council for their commitment to supporting police in the province with projects of staff accommodation, logistics on land and sea, and others.
ELCPNG secretary, Bernard Kaisom, said this MoU was signed with the Madang Provincial Government, and the church is ready and committed to partnering with them in their development initiatives.
Kaisom said in the past, the church operated the Asuar Leprosy Hospital and later, the Yangpela Didiman program, on the Asuar portion.
“This signing demonstrates the Madang Provincial Government’s confidence in partnering with ELCPNG in its development aspirations, and we are grateful that a lot of church assets are in Madang,” continued secretary Kaisom.
“This agreement is more than just an agreement, and we are looking forward to working closely with you in our ongoing discussions for other projects.”
Madang provincial acting administrator, Daniel Aloi, said they appreciate this signing, adding that under the leadership of Madang Governor Ramsey Pariwa, law and order is a priority, and they are supporting where needed.

Marape Honors PANGU Legacy,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4853,,Politics,Trust,"James Marape, Michael Somare","Prime Minister James Marape has commemorated the 58th anniversary of PANGU Pati by honouring the party’s founding leaders and their role in shaping Papua New Guinea’s independence and national identity.
Speaking ahead of the anniversary on June 13, Prime Minister Marape described PANGU Pati as “the political force that paved the way for Papua New Guinea’s independence.”
“PANGU Pati was born before the country itself,” said Marape. “It was the leadership and courage of PANGU’s founding members that pushed fearlessly for our freedom.”
Founded on 13 June 1967 while PNG was still under colonial rule, PANGU Pati emerged at a time of widespread division—cultural, regional, and political. It united young leaders from across the territory under one vision: self-rule and national unity.
“They were young men—many in their 20s and 30s—who stood against discrimination and demanded our people chart their own future,” the Prime Minister said.
PANGU played a critical role in unifying the country, particularly during a time when regional movements like the Mataungan Association and Napidakoe Navitu challenged the idea of national unity. The party’s momentum led to key victories in the 1968 elections and later, full independence in 1975.
Marape paid tribute to the 13 founding parliamentarians, including Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, Sir Paul Lapun, Sir Albert Maori Kiki, and others, calling them “nation-builders” whose legacies live on through the country’s democratic foundations.
Under PANGU’s leadership, institutions like the Ombudsman Commission, the Defence Force, Police, and Correctional Services were established, along with the Constitution and the localisation of civil service roles.
As PNG’s third PANGU Prime Minister after Somare and Sir Rabbie Namaliu, Marape reflected on his 2019 return to the party, emphasising his commitment to its people-first values and vision for economic independence.
He urged the younger generation to honour the past while building a stronger, united future:
“The opportunity is now ours—to learn from our past 50 years, correct what we must, and shape a future of strength and unity.”"

The plan focuses on five main pillars: enhancing public safety and compliance, reforming service delivery, strengthening institutional capabilities, embracing digital and technological reformation, and delivering the best experience to customers.
The launch was attended representatives from the Royal PNG Constabulary including Commander NCD/Central Benjamin Turi and NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab.

This plan is a roadmap that captures RTA’s vision, values, and responsibilities to the citizens, transport operators, and future generations,” Renewa said.
The RTA Acting CEO said the cooperate plan is an operational task; about delivering national road results over the next three years.
“Under this plan, we aim to reduce road fatalities and traffic-related injuries by a measurable margin, achieve over 90 percent compliance in vehicle registration and driver's license, and establish regional enforcement and customer service centers across the country,” Mr Avira said.
Minister Kaeok says the government expects the RTA to contribute meaningfully to government regulation, ensuring that compliance remains reasonable for citizens and businesses.
“Most importantly, we expect RTA to build and maintain public trust through transparent, efficient service delivery.
“This corporate plan must not become a document that gathers dust on the shelves. This plan represents a commitment to the people of PNG, and I challenge you all to ensure that this document remains a living document that guides the decision of RTA,” Minister Kaeok added."
Call to strengthen security in schools,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4847,,Education,Fear,Lucas Dekena,"The Minister for Education, Lucas Dekena, strongly condemns the criminal actions at Nawaeb Secondary School in Morobe and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to making all schools safe and secure for students.
“We will not allow criminals to bring fear into our schools. Every student has the right to feel safe and protected while they learn.
“The Department is already working with the Morobe Provincial Education Division, police, and local leaders to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice and that measures are in place to prevent a repeat of this horrific incident,” Minister Dekena said.
He added, “The incident at Nawaeb Secondary School was a grave violation of student safety and security. However, through the swift efforts of school leaders, provincial authorities, and law enforcement, the situation has been brought under control.”
The school has since resumed normal classes. This week is the assessment period, and the school will close for the Term 2 break on Friday, 20 June 2025. Security has been increased on campus and students are being monitored closely to ensure their safety.
In response to the incident, the Department, through the Morobe Provincial Education Division, will immediately review school security measures in the province.
This review will also apply to all schools nationwide. The measures include: Tighter gate access control, more police patrols during vulnerable periods and hours, stronger community partnerships to improve school safety, and psychological support for affected students.
On the evening of Thursday, 5 January 2025, seventeen armed individuals, believed to be part of a criminal group, entered the Nawaeb Lutheran Secondary School grounds and attempted to steal mobile phones from the girls’ dormitory.
During the confrontation, seven female students were stabbed, and two male students were hurt while trying to drive the attackers away. Two of the female students remain in critical condition at Angau Memorial Hospital, while the rest have been treated and discharged.
Secretary for Education, Dr. Uke Kombra, confirmed that the attack was not linked to land disputes, school fees, or internal issues.
“This was an act of opportunistic criminal behaviour targeting students,” Dr. Kombra said.
The Department is urging parents, community leaders, and citizens to work together with schools to prevent such incidents and ensure schools remain safe spaces for learning and growth."
Islanders soon to call Andarum home,13/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4850,,Disaster,Joy,Nill,"The people of Manam Island based at the Asuramba Care Centre were overjoyed at the prospect of being resettled in Andarum in the next three or four months, following the arrival of two new machinery that will begin the clearing process of the resettlement site in Andarum.
Charles Tola, Iabu LLG counselor in Ward 3 of Bogia District, Madang province is one Manam Islander excited to see the movement of the machines.
The Manam Islanders were evacuated following 2004 volcanic eruptions and were settled in care centres in Bogia. Their population at that time was around 9, 000. After more than 20 years of living in the care centres, numbers have more than doubled to be at least 21,000.
Over the years, life in the care centres was not always pleasant for the displaced islanders. While learning to adapt to the new environment, they conflicted among themselves and with landowners for gardening space, education opportunities, health services, and even keeping their traditions alive.
Today, they look forward to see a government’s commitment come to fruition; to settle them in Andarum, where they will now call home on the mainland."
Hope emerges for displaced Manam Islanders,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4835,,Local,Joy,Jim Kas,"The Manam Resettlement Authority (MaRA) has made some progress in the resettlement exercise when they finally brought in two newly purchased machines on Tuesday to start work on the resettlement program.
The new excavator and bulldozer were bought in from Lae, Morobe province and costed approximately K1.2 million.
It was a joyous day for the displaced people of Manam Island currently located in care centres at Potzdam, Asuramba and Mangem to witness the launch of the two machines brought in by MaRA. After more than 20 years, they finally see a glimmer of hope as this signifies a working progress to their resettlement in Andarum.
MaRA Chief Executive Officer Richard Baia elaborated that with the inclusion of these two machines, their work should speed up with partners in construction, Works and Gabusi construction, to commence the next phase which is acquisition of land and settlement.
It was an emotional event for former Extension Services Manager of MaRA, Paul Akuram, who recalled the challenges faced when conducting assessments for over 13 years before retiring. He was pleased to see progress made after he left. Mr. Akuram played a huge role in mediating to awareness campaigns during his time from 2009. He now urges the government to fully show support to the resettlement program and alleviate many challenges being faced by the Manam islanders within the care centres.
While no provincial or district government official was present to witness this small but significant event, former Madang Governor Jim Kas was invited to witness the event as this program was his brainchild. Kas was not impressed by the lack of his predecessors to date and urged the provincial and district government to take ownership, even though it is a national government issue. He further thanked the host communities of Bogia who have catered for the internally displaced people of Manam, even with no proper arrangements when hurled with the resettlement circumstances.
Manam representative Kaugare Ferdinand is hopeful that 2025 will be a fruitful year and anticipates resettlement to begin soon.
Host community representative Raphael Juaf was also thanful to see a new development into the resettlement program.
In addition, Works Manager Sakarim Michael indicated continued support in ensuring that work can now progress swiftly for resettlement following the arrival of the machinery.
Mr. Baia also acknowledged his staff who have tirelessly worked to see this program come to fruition and a special mention was also made to a late staff, Gabriel Saul, who passed away two weeks ago after the purchase of the two machines. He also informed the people that a Board is in place and will oversee the program as it transitions into the next phase.
Board members will include Dr. Figa Boga as Chairman, the Provincial Administrator, the Archbishop of Madang Archdiocese and a member from DPM.
It was also made clear that after the program is completed, all machineries purchased by MaRA will be given to the Bogia District Administration.
The machines were blessed by Bogia Catholic Parish priest and will eventually be driven up to relocation site this week."
Imi Ward Development Plan Launch,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4837,,Development,Joy,Nill,"In a landmark event, the Imi Ward in Enga province successfully launched its Ward Development Plan that integrates disaster risk reduction to local plans in alignment with the Nation’s Vision 2050 Plan, SDG Goals, Sendai Framework for disaster management and enhanced peace for growth to empower community leadership for change and natural assets stock take and plan sustainable use.
The development and launch of the plan marked the culmination of a community owned and driven initiative supported by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) through funding from the U.S. Government.  Development of the plan received technical inputs from IOM and local authorities.
The launch was led solely by community leaders, and the ward councillor in Imi Ward after several consultations with assistance from Enga Provincial Disaster Coordinator, the support of all parts of the community. Representing IOM at the launch were Sakurako Oki, Public Health Specialist, and Benjamin Sipa, Senior Project Assistant. The event drew the attendance of key officials from the Enga Provincial and Wabag District Administrations, including directors from the Community Development Division and Local Level Government, the district administrator, agriculture and education officers, and law and order coordinators.
The gathering provided a platform for local leaders, officials, and community members to share remarks and commend the collaborative efforts behind the development of the plan.
Importantly, members of the Provincial Management Team (PMT) who attended the event pledged PGK 100,000 to support the construction of a double classroom — a priority identified in the ward plan. This contribution demonstrates growing provincial commitment to locally informed development planning.
The Director for Local Level Government commended the community members in undertaking this work, and IOM for providing technical inputs.  He noted that such plans represent a critical new pathway for complementing the government’s development initiatives in Papua New Guinea.
The Wabag District Administrator echoed these sentiments, urging other wards to follow Imi’s example and reinforcing that ward development committees should be central to community governance.
More than 800 people, including women, children, youth, and elders, gathered for the launch. Community contributions in both cash and kind, traditional performances, and the involvement of children highlighted the spirit of ownership and pride among the people of Imi. Youth groups organized clean-up efforts, children cerebrated by singing, and volunteers helped decorate the school grounds, which served as the venue for the event.
While the plan’s launch marks significant progress, IOM also updated the community on the status of a proposed multi-purpose community evacuation center.
The successful launch event highlights the power of inclusive planning, strong community leadership, and collaboration between development partners and government institutions. To ensure the Ward Development Plan remains a dynamic tool for guiding Imi Ward’s long-term, sustainable development, continued capacity-building and the formal establishment of an active Ward Development Committee are essential."
Simbu projects assessed in Nationwide Evaluation Exercise,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4834,,Government,Trust,James Marape,"A monitoring and evaluation (M&E) exercise is underway in Simbu Province, spearheaded by the Department of National Planning and Monitoring (DNPM) to assess the implementation and progress of development projects funded between 2022 and 2024.
The exercise aims to verify the status of projects financed through various sources, including the Public Investment Program (PIP), District and Provincial Services Improvement Programs (DSIP and PSIP), development partners, tax credit schemes, and private sector contributions.
According to the First Assistant Secretary for the Social Sector Division, Rose Raka, the findings will contribute to a national report being prepared for Prime Minister James Marape, highlighting tangible outcomes and the effectiveness of government investment in districts and provinces across the country.
“Prime Minister James Marape intends to report on the achievements and developments that have taken place throughout the districts and provinces across the country. Given that a significant amount of funding has been directed to the provinces and districts, it is important that a report is compiled and submitted so the Prime Minister has tangible outcomes to present—showing what has actually been financed through the allocated funds over the past three years.”
Simbu Provincial Administrator John Punde welcomed the initiative and stressed the importance of building institutional knowledge, strengthening manpower, and restructuring administrative systems to align with evolving national priorities such as climate change and improved service delivery.
“Moving forward, you need the right manpower to deliver on those expectations. I think the team has done a wonderful job, and the level of institutional knowledge we are building through this interaction is valuable. It will help us in the future—especially when individuals move into senior positions—because these issues take time to develop. Gaining hands-on experience, engaging in discussions, and reflecting on these matters collectively can expose you to 30 to 40 years of accumulated experience in a short period.”
The team is expected to complete inspections across all six districts in Simbu. The exercise is part of a nationwide effort to promote transparency and accountability in public spending."
PNG-based dual Australian and Nigerian citizen charged with human trafficking of PNG nationals,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4841,,Crime,Disgust,Nill,"A woman who allegedly lured Papua New Guinea (PNG) nationals to Australia with fake scholarships before exploiting them has been charged with debt bondage and other human trafficking offences.
The AFP charged the woman – a dual Australian and Nigerian citizen who was based primarily in PNG – after she arrived at Brisbane Airport on a flight from PNG yesterday (11 June, 2025).
She appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court yesterday afternoon charged with 31 offences and was granted conditional bail to reappear before the same court on 19 September, 2025.
An investigation began in July, 2022, when the AFP’s Northern Command Human Trafficking Team received information from Queensland Police about a group of PNG nationals who had moved to Australia to study but were instead allegedly forced to work against their will on farms.
The woman allegedly lured them to Australia on the promise of full educational scholarships.
The AFP alleges that between March 2021 and July 2023, the woman bought 15 PNG nationals to Australia. Shortly before, or after, their arrival in Australia, the students were allegedly forced to sign legal documents and agree to repay hitherto unmentioned costs associated with tuition, airfares, visa applications, insurance and legal fees.
These unexpected costs placed the PNG nationals in excessive debt.
The woman then allegedly forced the PNG nationals to work on farms at different locations in Queensland – at times in contravention to their visas – and received wages on their behalf from the farm owners.
The woman then withheld the wages from the workers as repayments for their debts.
The woman, 56, was charged with:
•	Four counts of trafficking in persons, contrary to section 271.2(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is 12 years’ imprisonment;
•	14 counts of deceptive recruiting for labour or services, contrary to section 270.7 of the Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is seven years’ imprisonment; and
•	13 counts of engaging in conduct that caused a person to enter into debt bondage, contrary to section 270.7C of the Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty for this offence is four years’ imprisonment.
AFP Detective Superintendent Adrian Telfer said the AFP remained committed to the protection of vulnerable foreign workers targeted by those driven by greed and profits.
“Victims of debt bondage and other human trafficking offences can be lured to Australia with a promise of a dream career or free education, things they may not have access to in their country of origin,"" Det-Supt Telfer said.
“If the conditions of that promise change, it can leave victims in an extremely vulnerable situation in a foreign country, where they are likely to have little financial or emotional support, and face issues with language barriers.
“The AFP can help people who are exploited and is focused on ensuring the welfare of victims.”"
Trainee graduates urged to champion Financial Literacy,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4838,,Education,Joy,Nill,"A mini graduation held at the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) on Friday, 6th June 2025, marked the conclusion of a five-day Financial Literacy Training of Trainers (ToT) and Retail Training, sponsored by the Department for Community Development and Religion (DFCDR) and facilitated by the Centre for Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI). The programme, conducted from the 2nd to 6th June, aimed to equip participants with critical financial knowledge and practical training skills to promote financial inclusion across the country.
A total of 27 participants, 11 females and 16 males all officers from the UPNG student services division and Department of Community Development and Religion participated in the Financial Literacy Training of Trainers.
As for the retail training conducted by the Department of Community Development & Religion, over 147 students from the University were trained. The group was comprised of student leaders from association groups, the SRC and other groups who reside on campus. Topics covered in both the ToT and Retail Training included making savings plan, creating a simple budget, cash flow tracking sheets and basic money management skills.
The ToT participants also learnt basic training techniques such as facilitating group learning, assessing group learning and providing supportive resource materials to complement their learning sessions.
Delivering the opening remarks at the graduation ceremony, Mr Robinson Lanza, Deputy Director for Research and Community at UPNG, acknowledged the joint effort between the university, DFCDR, and CEFI in delivering the training. He praised the contribution of financial institutions including MiBank, Mama Bank, BSP and the Investment Promotion Authority (IPA), and commended the trainees for their dedication.

Manager for Financial Inclusion and Capacity Development at CEFI Jill Pijui,  reiterated the importance of such partnerships in advancing financial inclusion. She noted that CEFI’s mission is guided by policies from the Department of Treasury and the Department of National Planning and Monitoring, and aims to transition over two million unbanked citizens into the formal financial sector.
“Your impact starts at home,” Ms Pijui told the graduates.
“Apply what you’ve learnt in your lives before you train others. The certificate only becomes meaningful when the knowledge is put into action.”
She highlighted the importance of both theoretical learning such as budgeting and saving and the practical ability to train and support others in financial matters
Mr Guninandhi Das, CEO of Women’s Microbank emphasized the role of mindset in fostering sound financial habits.
“Financial literacy starts with the mindset of savings.”
“It is not just about putting money away - it’s about making everyday decisions that prioritize value over waste.”
He encouraged graduates to form habits that promote savings and to eventually embed it as part of their culture. Mr Das further advised trainees to maintain active bank accounts and mobile numbers, underscoring their importance in accessing future financial services and building credibility.
Delivering the official closing remarks on behalf of Secretary DFCDR Jerry Ubase, Director of Programme, George Kulisi, acknowledged the cultural norm in Papua New Guinea of giving over saving and called for a shift in mindset that supports financial responsibility.
He commended the training’s alignment with the Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS), specifically Priority Area 11, which promotes community empowerment, financial inclusion, and youth leadership.
“The Department remains committed to building meaningful partnerships with institutions like UPNG,” Mr Kulisi stated.
“We encourage graduates to apply this knowledge and lead the way in building a more financially responsible Papua New Guinea.”
Participants also took the stage to share their reflections. Vencislos Edmund, speaking on behalf of the male trainees, thanked all stakeholders and expressed his determination to pass on what he had learnt.
Otolose Sheekiot, representing the female trainees, emphasized the relevance of financial literacy amid current economic challenges.
“This training has equipped us with life-changing skills,” she said.
“As a school board member, I intend to bring this knowledge into schools and communities.”"

Police Work Boosted in Kairuku District,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4831,,Politics,Trust,Peter Isoaimo,"With a renewed focus on law and order in the district, Member for Kairuku and Energy Minister, Peter Isoaimos officially handed over new IT equipment and confirmed logistics support to the Bereina Police Station to boost policing efforts across the electorate.
The donated equipment, valued at over K16,000, includes two laptops, a desktop computer, a large and two small printers, a UPS, and a generator. These are intended to enhance data processing, case management, and communication for officers in Bereina, enabling faster and more efficient processing of suspects
“In recent months, we’ve seen a surge in criminal activity in Kairuku. This is part of our response — not just through words, but through action,” said Isoaimo. “We’re equipping the police with the tools and logistics they need to work effectively.”
As part of the Kairuku District Development Authority's initiative, two open-back Land Cruiser vehicles have been made available for police use. In collaboration with the Police Headquarters, an additional two hire vehicles have been secured to support operations in Bereina and Doa.
The Bereina Police Station building is undergoing full renovations, with additional work planned for the expansion of the cell block, which currently cannot hold the increasing number of detainees. Renovations are also planned for the Doa Police Post, originally built by Ramu Company, and improvements to police housing are on the agenda.
Police Station Commander Sergeant William Hoiba was commended by the MP for his leadership, having served in the Central Province Police for over 20 years. Isoaimo emphasised Hoiba’s commitment to zero tolerance of corrupt practices within the force.
“We need to take a tough, no-nonsense approach. When suspects are caught, they must be processed in Bereina and sent directly to Bomana for rehabilitation,” Isoaimo said. “We cannot allow them to be released from Boroko under what many call ‘snake bail’ — that undermines policing.”
Isoaimo also called on all police personnel to uphold integrity and discipline in their service, warning that compromise will not be tolerated.
Inspector Kingsley Lua, Staff Officer to the Provincial Police Commander for Central, acknowledged the importance of continued government support and community cooperation in restoring law and order.
The MP further raised concerns about NCD police who have allegedly been harassing SME-owned PMV trucks crossing the Laloki Bridge into the city in the early hours. He pledged to personally investigate these incidents alongside Central police and the media in the coming days.
“These trucks were bought through the Kairuku SME program by ordinary villagers. They deserve to operate in peace without fear or extortion,” Isoaimo stated.
With over 50 reservists already engaged and plans to deploy more officers across Kairuku’s 51 wards, covering Mekeo, Kairuku Coast, and Kuni LLGs, the district’s law enforcement presence is expected to grow significantly.
“As we prepare to celebrate PNG’s 50th Independence Anniversary, our people deserve to live in peace, not fear. We may not eliminate lawlessness entirely, but we are determined to reduce it dramatically,” Isoaimo said."
History comes home on the wings of a Hell’N Pelican,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4830,,History,Trust,Nill,"A Douglas A-20 Havoc bomber aircraft used by the 5th United States Army Air Force (USAAF) during the Second World War has taken residence at the Papua New Guinea National Museum and Art Gallery (NMAG) in Port Moresby.
Nicknamed Hell’N Pelican II, the aircraft was returned to Papua New Guinea by the Royal Australian Air Force on board the Australian Defence Vessel (ADV) Reliant.
The delivery of the aircraft recognises Australia and Papua New Guinea’s shared history, with the aircraft being a permanent representation of the long-standing cooperation and close defence relationship forged in shared suffering, tenacity and sacrifice during the Second World War.
“The friendship between PNG and Australia means a lot not only to the people of PNG but also to the PNG National Museum and Art Gallery,” said Terence Moka, President of the PNG National Museum and Art Gallery Board of Trustees.
“We accept with thanks the gift of the new heritage aviation shelter, and the return of the historical Havoc aircraft, and look forward to our future close relationship with the Royal Australian Air Force.”
In 1944, the aircraft was assigned to USAAF pilot Second Lieutenant Charles Anderson. During a mission the Hell’N Pelican II hit bad weather and made a forced landing near Amaiamon village in Madang Province, PNG. The pilot and the other crew member, USAAF gunner Sergeant John McKenna, managed to escape.
The aircraft was hidden by vegetation for the next three decades until it was located by an Australian Defence Force team, transported to Australia and restored by a specialist team from the Royal Australian Air Force.
The Hell’N Pelican II had been on display in the Aviation Heritage Centre at RAAF Base Amberley since 1996 until a suitable location to permanently house the aircraft in PNG was established.
The 5th USAAF was established in Townsville on February 5, 1942, when it was moved to Australia as part of a transformation of Garbutt Airfield to become a major staging post for combat missions."

SEZ license approved for Sea Park Development at Ela Beach,12/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4832,,Business,Anticipation,Richard Maru,"The Government’s Special Economic Zone Authority (SEZA) has approved a Special Economic Zone License for a landmark tourism investment for the Sea Park Development Project at Ela Beach with an investment value of PGK 2.2 billion.
This will see a complete transformation of Port Moresby City and the Ela Beach precinct led by international investors. It is part of the National Government’s development initiative and is being driven by Richard Maru, the Minister responsible for SEZ and the Ministry for International Trade & Investment (MITI).
The Sea Park Development, anchored within a nationally endorsed SEZ framework, is positioned to become a landmark project. The project will serve not only as a beacon for international and domestic tourism but also as a sustainable model for future urban developments in Papua New Guinea. It will also be a beacon of attraction to investors and make PNG an attractive investment destination. This landmark investment will compliment Paga Hill Special Economic Zone and will change the look of the capital city and attract foreign tourists and cruise ships to anchor in Port Moresby.
Designated and licensed as a Tourism Special Economic Zone, the Ela Beach precinct is now home to a mixed-use development that includes luxury residences, commercial and retail centers, a five-star international hotel, and a nature-integrated hilltop retreat. This transformative project is expected to create over 2,000 jobs during construction and about 700 full time jobs for PNG nationals after the completion of the project. It will also generate substantial long-term economic benefits through local business participation, tourism development, and government tax revenues in the 10-years tax break and after.
The Sea Park Development Project is aligned with Papua New Guinea's Vision 2050, particularly its goals of sustainable development, infrastructure expansion, and tourism-led economic diversification. Its broad benefits include:
•	Increased foreign tourism inflows and international brand recognition.
•	Urban regeneration and improved public infrastructure at Ela Beach.
•	Enhanced investment attractiveness through SEZ-led policy incentives.
•	Long-term uplift in local living standards and private sector development.
The Chairman of Special Economic Zones Authority, Dr. Lawrence Sause, praised the project as ""a shining example of how the SEZ framework is unlocking Papua New Guinea's investment potential and accelerating economic diversification.""
It also shows that despite the challenges that PNG faces, there are rooms to lure FDIS into the country for its growth and development.
The SEZA and the SEZ policy for which SEZA rides on, provides streamlined approvals, fiscal incentives, and investor protections, which have proven instrumental in attracting strategic partners and foreign capital. The Sea Park Project is seen as a blueprint for future SEZ developments that will catalyze growth across the country.
SEZA states that they fully welcome the Sea Park investors and will continue to deliver a regulatory environment that builds investor confidence, lures FDIS and maintain a level playing field for both foreign and citizens participation in business development in PNG.
Meanwhile, SEZA has terminated the SEZ License for Mayur Industrial's Central Cement and Lime Project (CCLP) pending certain specific issues to be sorted out.
Once the company irons out all these outstanding issues then it can re-apply for a new SEZ License. SEZA states that this decision reflects SEZA's commitment to ensuring that all license holders operate within a clearly regulated framework that supports genuine downstream industrial development."
Court Denies Rapists’ Plea to Stay at Boroko Cell,11/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4824,,Law,Disgust,Nill,"The Boroko Holding Cell keeps perpetrators who are awaiting court for their first appearance, and when their matter is heard in court, they are required to be remanded at Bomana prison, says District Court Magistrate Albert Daniels.
Daniels said this after refusing a request from one of the alleged rapists, Constable Danny Karayo, who made a verbal application to be kept at the Boroko Holding Cell rather than Bomana prison.
“Your oral application seeking remand at Boroko goes against the normal protocol of using the Boroko Cell.  Boroko Cell is a facility that keeps those awaiting court for the first time. It simply means that when you are remanded at Boroko, you are required to appear in court the next day.
“However, your request to be remanded at Boroko for two months is against protocol, and the court will not allow that,” Daniels said.
In response, Karayo, said multiple disciplinary actions were taken against him and his co-accused. For this reason, he asked the court to exercise its mercy and keep them at Boroko Cell.
In response, Daniels reminded him again that there are protocols in place that require him and the others to follow.
“The best approach you should take is to file a formal application outlining the issues and the reasons. The court will then act on your application to make its decision,” Magistrate Daniels added.
Karayo, and co-accused Carl Yori, and Jerry Aura were arraigned yesterday for allegedly involved in raping a 22-year-old woman at the Saraga Police Post on June 03, 2025."

The inaugural program was a first-of-its-kind concept, initiated by PNGUoT in alignment with its vision to grow world-class technocrats who will not only have the intellectual capability but also the right mindset and attitude.
With only one student being excused due to injuries, 66 successfully concluded their training, keen to return to campus to share their experience with their peers.
Following the successful execution of the inaugural boot camp last year, PNGUoT and the PNG Defence Force’s Joint Forces Academy signed the MoA to continue the program.
PNGUoT Deputy Vice Chancellor, Prof Garry Sali, described the boot camp as a crucial tool in the development of students’ mindsets, which could lead to positive behavioural change.
He believes the training, which is physically and mentally demanding, will help students to make rationale decisions in tough situations, as well as sharpen their leadership traits.
Meantime, the MoA highlights the areas of responsibility and guiding terms for the organisations to implement the program called the “Unitech military boot camp”.
The bootcamp commenced on Tuesday, June 10th, for this year’s batch of students."
PNG and Australia Lead Regional Effort to Improve Anaesthetic Care,11/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4819,,Health,Trust,Nill,"In a significant step towards improving anaesthetic care, doctors from Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH), School of Medicine and Health Sciences (SMHS) and Australia and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) conducted the Safer Anaesthesia From Education (SAFE) Paediatric and Obstetrics Anaesthesia Courses in Honiara last week.
This initiative aims to equip healthcare professionals with essential skills to manage high-risk paediatric and obstetric patients safely and efficiently.
The World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologist (WFSA) SAFE Paediatric and Obstetrics Anaesthesia Courses are designed for both anaesthetic professionals and healthcare workers involved in paediatric and obstetric care. Given the heightened risks associated with these age groups, especially in low-middle income countries, such training and upskilling is crucial. The course covers:
- Early identification of complications, management, and stabilisation
- Resuscitation techniques
- Airway techniques
- Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced Life Support (ALS) for critically ill patients who will undergo anaesthesia for surgery. The principles can also be applied to patients not undergoing surgery where necessary.
Following successful training sessions in Port Moresby last year, the SAFE course is now being conducted in collaboration with the Anaesthetic Department of the National Referral Hospital in Honiara.
A team comprising of three specialists from PNG and four from Australia facilitated the workshops successfully.
More than 50 healthcare professionals enrolled and participated in the SAFE workshops.
This initiative reflects the commitment of PMGH and the Society of Anaesthetists of Papua New Guinea (SAPNG) to enhancing anaesthetic practices across Papua New Guinea and the neighbouring Pacific Islands.
The goal is to reduce anaesthetic-related mortality, morbidity, and near misses while fostering a stronger network of skilled anaesthetists and health professionals.
As the training progresses, the emphasis on collaborative learning, networking, and shared expertise is expected to strengthen anaesthetic care across the region, benefiting both healthcare providers and their patients."

This was presented by Lorraine Angham, a medical expert from the Directorate of Social Change and Mental Health Services. She discussed the harmful effects of betel nut, explaining how its consumption, like that of other substances, negatively impacts the brain.

Madang Traffic Office gets facelift,10/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4814,,Community,Joy,Nill,"It was a milestone achievement for police in Madang province to finally open their refurbished Traffic Office. The community and contractors came out to witness the occasion alongside staff and management of Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd (MCC) through its mining entity Ramu NiCo. MCC funded the project. The refurbishment included new roofing irons and materials with the inclusion of new furniture.
The old Traffic Office stood the test of time since it first went up in the 1960s. Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim said he grew up seeing the Traffic Office disintegrate with time. Now that he was commanding the Madang Police force, the office needed a facelift.
This refurbishment project was initiated by PPC Baim and Traffic Officer In Charge, Frank Makora with support from the Office of the Madang Governor. Ramu NiCo came through with funding after the governor’s office organized the partnership.
Ramu NiCo Community Affairs General Manager Eric Kuman, on behalf of MCC and Ramu NiCo, stated that this is a well-deserved project. Traffic officers can perform their duties better and also assist in other community policing efforts within the town area.
The construction work was contracted to landowner company Raibus Engineering Ltd. They took two months to complete it. It was the first time for a local company to partner with a government agency in service delivery."
MAF’s New aircraft in service,10/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4813,,Humanitarian,Trust,Nill,"The newest aircraft that joined Mission Aviation Fellowship last week, P2-AFD, officially launched into service by delivering patients, passengers, fresh produce and vital supplies to some of the country’s most isolated communities in just a few days from arriving.
Markus Bischoff who pilots the aircraft completed its first three days of operations in the rugged Telefomin region. From landing at hard-to-reach bush airstrips including Busilmin, Tekin, Wobagen which rely on air transport to Yokona, which is operatorial since less than 2 years ago.
“Busilmin is one of the really remote bush communities with a well-established but demanding airstrip,” said Bischoff. “We can’t go there often due to weather. It’s really ‘out bush’. This time there were health and education workers flying out to Telefomin—more traffic than usual.”
Yokona made an impression as the first place to get the new aircraft visibly muddy.
“It was so dirty, I actually felt bad about getting out there!” Bischoff said. “It’s a very remote and isolated community. Four people went out for work, and there was one patient and a guardian going to the Telefomin hospital.”
“These flights are the community’s economic lifeline,” Bischoff explained. “They’re not as dramatic as medevacs, but they help people earn an income, pay school fees, access healthcare, and afford flights. Even though Wobagen and Tekin are just as remote as places like Yokona, they’re better off because of that economic flow.”
With few or no roads in the region, and only one route under construction between Tabubil and Telefomin, aviation remains the only practical connection to the outside world.
Bischoff expressed that it’s a rewarding experience to help remote communities.
“You can really see the impact. Around Telefomin, it’s about the basics—rice, education, medical care. What we do isn’t just convenient. It’s life changing,” he said.
P2-AFD is the latest addition to MAF’s Papua New Guinea fleet joining an existing fleet of nine Cessna Caravan aircraft and one amphibious C208."

No deep-sea mining in PNG,10/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4809,,Global,Trust,James Marape,"At the Third United Nations Oceans Conference (UNOC3), underway this week in Nice, France, Prime Minister James Marape has stated his government’s stance on Deep Sea Mining.
In the conference attended by 148 world leaders, Marape confirmed that PNG will not carry out Deep Sea Mining, underscoring the lack of research and available data in this space.
“On deep sea mining, our country subscribes to prevent deep sea mining in our EEZ zones (Exclusive Economic Zones), especially in the absence of robust scientific evidence regarding its environmental impact and foot print,” Marape told the conference.
The Prime Minister also reiterated his call for major carbon emitters to remain committed to the Paris Agreement in order to prevent further ocean degradation and also ensure the world keeps within the 1.5 degree Celsius temperature goal of the agreement.
He also expressed disappointment in the slow response by the international community to assist countries like Papua New Guinea who have done so much in the forest sector to mitigate climate change.
“Despite Papua New Guinea’s unwavering commitment and efforts for the forest sector as an answer to mitigate climate change, we remain seriously concerned that the extensive work done in the forest sector under the Paris Agreement has yet to see any tangible returns for us from the international community, so far. This is most disappointing, to say the least. We can do better,” said the Prime Minister.
Prime Minister in delivering Papua New Guinea’s national statement to the Conference on 9 June outlined PNG’s ocean biodiversity and how important the ocean is the people.
“Papua New Guinea as a large maritime and archipelagic nation with around 2.8 million square kilometers of maritime territory, and at the heart of the Coral Triangle, is home to 7 per cent of global biodiversity, one-third of the world’s tuna stocks, and the fourth largest coral reef system on the planet. PNG must ensure there is strategic leadership in the country to make sure that our maritime zones, including exclusive economic zone and its resources, are better protected and used sustainably for the country’s benefit now and for future generations.
“The ocean is not just a resource, it is the lifeblood of our people, our culture, our identity and our economy”.
He also highlighted work done by the government so far in protecting oceans.
“ It has enacted the Marine Protected Areas Act targeting 30 percent marine protection by 2030, with over 17,000 square kilometres already designated; strengthened fisheries management under the enhanced regional cooperation and zone-based management; and intensified efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.
This is in addition to becoming a State Party to the Port State Measures Agreement, besides preparing to ratify the World Trade Organization Fisheries Subsidies Agreement later this year,” he stated."

Before that, Secretary Samuel and his delegation paid a courtesy visit to the West Sepik Provincial Administration, where they were received by Timothy Teklan, Deputy Provincial Administrator and his team.
Samuel explained that the purpose of the M&E Exercise was to assess the impact of government-funded investments, including development partner grants and concessional loans.

What is your contribution?,9/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4799,,Politics,Anger,John Rosso,"People tend to blame politicians for everything that is going wrong in this country. But what are their contributions to PNG’s development?
Acting Prime Minister and Lae MP, John Rosso, asked this during Lae’s launch of PNG’s 50th independence anniversary celebrations on Saturday, June 7th.
Aside from the launch, an auction for limited edition shirts was also held, where companies bid to sponsor PNG-designed shirts for primary and secondary schools in Lae.
At the event, the Lae MP said that while PNG has a long way to go, its citizens need to take ownership and contribute to positive growth instead of blaming the government for everything that goes wrong.
“A lot of people blame politicians, and I agree. Yes, we accept some of the blame,” Rosso stated. “Not all. But if all of us – every individual – us, I should do my job better; all politicians. We should make better decisions for the people we represent. But the bureaucrats, we need to do our jobs better too. And ordinary citizens, business people – everyone.
“For example, if everyone stopped throwing litter; just one little thing.
“Don’t you hate it when you’re driving behind a PMV bus and everyone just opens the window and chuck a mouthful of buai and bag of rubbish out?
“If all of these people stop throwing rubbish, the country wouldn’t need a garbage man.”
The Lae MP pointed out the illegal water and power connections that cost millions of Kina in losses, or the destruction of public properties, especially light poles and bus stop shelters. He emphasised that these are services and infrastructure that citizens should have taken ownership of, instead of damaging. This attitude problem has added to the setback experienced in the country.
“Everyone points fingers at everyone else, but no one takes responsibility for themselves. No one looks back and says, ‘I could’ve done better’. The guys at 11-Mile, cutting the power poles that we have put up for streetlights. Did the politician cut it?” asked the Lae MP.
“The guy who holds up the St John Ambulance when they are doing a voluntary service to go there. Did the politician hold them up?
“If we all change our attitudes, this place would be 10 times better.”
As PNG moves towards the next 50 years, the Lae MP stressed that the challenge is on all of us to ensure that we do the right thing for our people."

Tobe said these requirements were necessary to ensure that teams with a good player base are maintained for consistency. Teams that were dropped are encouraged to join other selected teams in the competition.
The selection criteria are:
•	Player Base – all clubs are required to have a Senior Team (A Grade), Under 21 (B Grade), and a Women's team. With a minimum of 20 players in each team, 60 in a club
•	Must have a training field for training
•	Registrations paid on time – club registration due on May 31st, with a separate K20 fee per player as insurance to PNGRFL
•	Attitude – a major key requisite. The death of the league was mainly due to violence and attitude problems, both from players and spectators.
Today, the executive committee met with selected clubs ahead of the start. An extension was given for the K20 player registration, which is due next Wednesday before the matches begin."
Trump warns Musk of 'serious consequences' if he backs Democrats at midterms,8/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4772,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"US President Donald Trump has warned Elon Musk could face ""serious consequences"" if his former ally and campaign benefactor tries to help Democrats in upcoming elections.
Mr Trump told NBC in a phone interview that he had no plans to repair the relationship, which ended in a spectacular, and very public, breakdown this week.
A slight easing of tensions came on Saturday, when Mr Musk deleted a social media post linking Mr Trump to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
However, when he was asked specifically if he thought his relationship with the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX was over, Mr Trump responded, ""I would assume so, yeah.""
The president also issued a warning amid speculation that Mr Musk could back Democratic candidates in the 2026 midterm elections.
He did not say what those consequences would be.
As a major government contractor, Mr Musk's businesses could be particularly vulnerable to retribution.
Mr Trump has already threatened to cut Mr Musk's contracts, calling it an easy way to save money.
""I gave him a lot of breaks, long before this happened, I gave him breaks in my first administration, and saved his life in my first administration, I have no intention of speaking to him,"" he said.

Saraga Rape Case - Officer Involved Was a Convict,8/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4777,,Law,Anger,Nill,"Police working to establish facts into the rape of a woman at Saraga Police Post have discovered a big failure in the police force – one of the officers involved in the rape, Constable Danny Karaio was convicted by the courts in 2012 and should be serving time in jail, instead was in police uniform working at the Saraga Police Post.
Police Commissioner David Manning revealed this in statement today while providing an update to the public on the ongoing investigation into the rape of a woman while in custody at the Saraga Police Post outside Six Mile.
Commissioner Manning has confirmed an immediate Inquiry is underway by Assistant Commissioner of Police (Internal Affairs). The Inquiry is directed to determine how karaio, sentenced in 2012 to more than 14 years imprisonment, was not still in prison, obtained a uniform and had been acting under the command of a supervising officer.
“Initial facts established by the Inquiry have revealed an unacceptable failure by Karaio’s commanding officers when he was convicted in 2012.
“Karaio’s supervising officers at the time, the Metropolitan Superintendent, and the Divisional Commander NCD, failed to ensure he was dismissed from the Force.
“They failed the Police Force and they failed our public.
“This individual was sentenced to imprisonment in 2012 for a period of more than 14 years. His commanding officers at the time had a duty to ensure that all actions were taken to ensure he could never wear a uniform again.
“This is a clear and disgraceful dereliction of duty from Commissioned Officers who owed our public better when this member was arrested in 2010 and when he was convicted in 2012.
“By operation of law, this individual had no place in the Police Force. By operation of Standing Orders, his supervising officers had a duty to ensure he was removed from the Force. By common decency, any member aware of his actions should have ensured he was removed from uniform and put behind bars.
“I expect that officers responsible for the supervision of this individual in 2012 would have done more to protect our community.”
Commissioner Manning confirmed that disciplinary processes introduced in recent years have strengthened the accountability of supervising officers, ensuring that any officer derelict in their duty is held to account.
“It saddens me that such a terrible incident has occurred because of a failure by officers to do their jobs a decade ago. This is unacceptable.
“Every member involved in these disgraceful shortcomings is being held to account under our strengthened accountability measures.
“Each and every officer who failed to stop this disgraceful individual is responsible for this shameful incident occurring.  More arrests will be made and charges laid.
“My message to supervising officers is clear.  You are responsible for the conduct of those under your command.  If you fail to prevent criminal conduct, you will be held responsible.”
Commissioner Manning noted the circulation of some false information on social media.
“I call on the public to be wary of posts that are simply based on rumour and rely on official information.”
Meantime, a manhunt is underway for the fourth suspect in the rape case.
The Commissioner said three arrests have been made with police closing in on a fourth individual with door-to-door searches being carried out.
“The manhunt for the auxiliary member allegedly involved in the rape of a woman at the Saraga Police Post is still underway,” the Commissioner said.
“Police are moving through densely populated settlement areas, and it is only a matter of time until he is located and arrested.”"

Pacific Prefab Homes enters market with unique designs,7/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4764,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"As the demand for better and affordable housing increases in the country, Pacific Prefab Homes has entered the market to help address this with the first three designs of their prefabricated homes out for display at Six Mile in Port Moresby. Going a step further, Prefab Homes has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with TISA Bank and has a financing arrangement with TISA for first time home buyers.
Under this financing arrangement, the first 100 home buyers can do a 10 per cent deposit with TISA Bank with an interest rate of 5.5 per cent per annum over a 40-year period. This financing arrangement is available to persons with registered land.
“Pacific Prefab House has a MOU with TISA Bank for first time home owners. As you can tell, it’s a good investment for a typical regular PNG employee. That instead of renting out a house, you have that option to invest and TISA’s there to help,” PPH Sales Consultant Biena Tejano-Woolcott said.
For the start, Pacific Prefabricated Homes is offering three different designs – the 93 square meter 3-bedroom home, the 135 square meter 3-bedroom home with a study and the premium 199 square meter 4-bedroom home. All houses come with an ensuite and a laundry room downstairs with a toilet, designed to cater for visitors or large gatherings, to suit the need of PNG families.
“Our prefab homes are made to the weather, the culture, and how we envision the type of PNG family will live in and it includes a big family – having everybody come over. So that’s why our homes have large verandahs, very open living room space and a downstairs area where the family can gather and enjoy together,” Woolcott explained.
Mrs Woolcott says the houses were carefully tailored to suit the tropical PNG climate with a four-layer insulation to withstand heat and is termite proof among others.
“So we have certification for earthquake proving, termite proving, and also water proving and fire intensity.
“We can withhold intensity nine (9) for earthquake, level 1.5 or 1.5 hours resistance for fire and resistance of 12 knots for the wind,” Mrs Woolcott added.
Once a home is purchased, it will take 30 days to be constructed in the factory overseas, 30 days for shipping and three weeks to install. Installation fees are separate but PPH can provide a site manager at a certain cost to manage the installation process.
PPH launched its homes on the 29th of May and looks to expand its designs to include, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and classrooms in the near future."

Juffa urges government to stop seabed mining,7/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4760,,Politics,Fear,"Byron Chan, Gary Juffa, Walter Schnaubelt","Northern Governor Gary Juffa is urging all Members of Parliament (MPs) especially those of coastal and island provinces to consider their people's livelihoods before endorsing and embracing seabed mining.
Governor Juffa expressed his concern in reaction to news of an MOU signing between the New Ireland Provincial Government and the consequential announcement that the New Ireland Provincial Government was ready to embrace seabed mining.
Governor Juffa urged the National Government and Acting New Ireland Governor Walter Schnaubelt to put a stop to the discussions surround seabed mining in New Ireland Province and sanction a thorough investigation by independent experts into the ramifications and repercussions of such activities on the ocean floor where sensitive ecosystems that are crucial to life in the ocean exist.
He added that the consequences on the plight of people who depend on the ocean for their livelihoods have to be understood.
“I recall that in the initial stages of the efforts of the predecessor Nautilus in their failed first attempt, there were some serious concerns raised by communities of New Ireland about the unusual reactions they experienced such as dead fish floating in their shores and murkiness and muddying of the pristine waters of New Ireland around the areas where Nautilus was operating. Meanwhile I recall sometime in August 2012 that a petition by coastal communities mainly from New Ireland of 18,000 signatures was presented to the then Mining Minister Byron Chan to stop seabed mining by Nautilus over environmental concerns. I was there. Nothing eventuated from that petition. Nautilus went ahead. Supported by the then O’Neill Government that also handed them a check of K300m public funds. Nautilus eventually went bankrupt and no effort was made to recoup these monies. Now they are back as a rebranded entity for a second bite and this should not be entertained. This Government should not allow this to happen again.”
Governor Juffa urged Schnaubelt and all MPs to carry out their own research into the potential hazards of seabed mining as warned by eminent scientists worldwide.
“The unknowns are too significant to ignore”.
He stated that many developed economies had refused seabed mining in their waters for this very reason. PNG is a developing nation that does not possess the technology or means to be able to adequately mitigate any risks posed by seabed mining.
“The previous impact assessment was deemed by scientists such as Dr Helen Rosenbaum and Dr Stephan Simpson as being “inadequate” as it did not carry out any assessment on the impact on the pelagic areas of the ocean where the project would be carried out. According to scientists, the pelagic areas are where life vents form whereby very sensitive organisms are produced and thrive which are vital chains in the ocean ecosystems. We cannot ignore this,” said Governor Juffa."

""Those involved in criminal offences are a minority of personnel that tarnish the reputation of the force and the majority of hardworking Police throughout the country.
""A Police Station is a safe place and anyone being brought in must be protected and treated with respect and dignity.
""A completely disgusting and dangerous criminal act is how I describe it.
""The arrest of the Officer in Charge of these members reflects the Constabulary's commitment to holding supervisors responsible for personnel under their command.
""I am disgusted and outraged at this incident. I share in our community's pain that any police officer would abuse the trust of public. This conduct has no place in our police force or our nation.""

Court refuses Lau’s stay application,6/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4749,,Politics,Neutral,Nill,"The Supreme Court yesterday dismissed the stay application filed by former Madang Provincial Administrator Frank Lau.
Justice Oagile Bethuel Key Dingake handed down the decision sitting as a single judge
In his application, Mr Lau challenged the National Court’s decision of April 16, 2024, seeking review of  the termination of his employment as the Provincial Administrator (PA) of Madang Province and the appointment of Daniel Aloi as acting administrator.
The National Court dismissed this application on March 15th, 2025.  Lau filed a judicial review at the Supreme Court to review that decision. This judicial review was accompanied by an application for a stay of the decision of April 16, 2024, which will effectively stay the decision of the NEC, and in effect will place him back in office.
Lawyer representing Mr Aloi Martin Kombri said, however, the court refused his application on the basis that the Secretary for the Department of Personnel Management, NEC, and the Madang Governor do not have a good working relationship with Mr Lau.
“The Governor does not have a good working relationship with Lau, the state does not want to continue his relationship with Lau, hence, the application for stay was refused.
“The decision now leaves the substantive appeal to be determined by the court.
“Furthermore, the decision of the court effectively means that Lau will no longer assume the office has the PA for Madang. The Acting appointment for Daniel Aloi is effectively confirmed by this decision, meaning Aloi is the Acting PA for Madang,” Kombri added."
Planting for the future,6/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4744,,Environment,Trust,Powes Parkop,"Today, TotalEnergies EP PNG Ltd (TotalEnergies) as Operator of the Papua LNG project, participated in the World Environment Day 2025 event organized by the National Capital District Commission (NCDC), at two different locations in Port Moresby.
As part of the global theme 'Ending Global Plastic Pollution,' the Project donated 500 native trees from eight different species and 100 mangrove seedlings. These will be planted around Port Moresby, with mangroves specifically planted along Kanudi.
Public Affairs Manager for TotalEnergies, Richard Kassman in his remarks highlighted TotalEnergies pride in being a part of the worldwide momentum to develop projects, pioneering initiatives towards a low carbon economy to beat plastic pollution.
“We are proud to present to Powes Parkop, eight species of native trees such as Okari, Rosewood, Kwila, Kapiak including one mangrove species, Avicennia marina that will be planted at Kanudi,” he said.
Papua LNG values building on its collaborative stakeholder partnerships. This has been reflected in the Project’s donation and participation in past World Environment Day activities, when the Project donated 500 trees to NCDC in 2023 and over 3000 mangrove seedlings to organisations and businesses in NCD areas, for planting, conservation and rehabilitation.
Coastal mangrove forests remove five times more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, than terrestrial forests. The Project is excited to work with NCDC and be a part of the Kanudi Mangrove Restoration Site.
Papua LNG emphasizes that it is committed to developing an exemplary Project with a strong focus on protecting the environment and enhancing biodiversity. The Project’s Zero Net Deforestation (ZND) objectives are well aligned with the NCDC’s own objectives to plant 1 million trees around Port Moresby in the next 10 years.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop whilst ceremoniously receiving the tree seedlings, acknowledged TotalEnergies for partnering with NCDC and for the mangrove rehabilitation and restoration program.
“You are a good corporate citizen of our city, but more importantly, I want to thank you all for supporting the Million trees campaign. Let’s imagine Port Moresby all green and with trees everywhere. Cooling the city and changing the ecology,” he said."

The goal is to inspire families, schools, and businesses to rethink waste management and embrace recycling for a cleaner PNG.
“These sculptures are more than art—they’re a call to action for all Papua New Guineans to take responsibility for our environment and to teach the younger generation to be more aware of the opportunity turning their everyday recyclable trash into Treasure.”
The Nature Park invites the public to visit, reflect, and join the movement, turning trash into treasured change for future generations."
Jiwaka submits 2024 APPR Reports,6/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4741,,Government,Trust,Soroi Eoe,"The Jiwaka Provincial Administration has made a significant stride toward accountability and transparency by submitting its first-ever comprehensive Section 119 Reports, fulfilling a key legislative requirement under the Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Governments today.
The reports, covering the 2023 to 2024 fiscal period, were officially handed over to the Department of Provincial and Local-level Government Affairs (DPLGA) by Jiwaka Provincial Administrator Rick Kogen.
The reports were received on behalf of Secretary Philip Leo by Deputy Secretary for the Provincial and Local Level Services Monitoring Authority (PLLSMA), James Agigo.
Kogen acknowledged the collaborative efforts of technical officers from both the Jiwaka Provincial Administration and DPLGA, who worked diligently to compile the reports under Section 119. He emphasized that this submission marks a turning point for the province since its establishment in 2012.
“From 2012 to 2022, no Section 119 reports were submitted to the DPLGA or the Minister. Under the current government and administration, we have produced and submitted our first comprehensive report for the 2023 to 2024 fiscal years. This is a proud moment for Jiwaka,” Kogen said.
He stated that the province is committed to strengthening governance systems and infrastructure development across key sectors including education, health, law and justice, transport, and economic development. These efforts are aligned with the 21 Strategic Areas, 12 Specific Areas, and 71 Deliberate Intervention Programs of the PNG Medium Term Development Plan IV (MTDP IV) 2023–2027.
“We have made notable progress over the last two years, and I am proud to report our achievements. This report is not just a compliance measure—it is a reflection of our service delivery and commitment to the people of Jiwaka,” Kogen added.
Deputy Secretary Agigo reiterated the importance of timely submissions, noting that June 30 is the annual deadline for all Provincial Governments to submit their Annual Provincial Government Performance Reports (APGPR).
“These reports must reflect performance across six key Minimum Priority Areas: Education, Health, Transport and Works, Primary Industry, Law and Justice, and Governance. They provide crucial insights into how provincial administrations are delivering essential services,” Agigo said.
He praised Jiwaka’s leadership and encouraged other provinces to follow suit.
In the recent May Parliamentary sitting, DPLGA Minister Soroi Eoe tabled a consolidated APGPR for 2018–2022, highlighting widespread non-compliance with Sections 114 and 119 of the Organic Law. He emphasized that these reports are not mere formalities, but essential tools to assess the impact of government in rural and underserved areas.
“For far too long, many provinces have neglected this responsibility. This has contributed to the ongoing lack of vital services like health clinics, functioning schools, and safe roads in remote communities. We must do better,” said Minister Eoe.
The submission by Jiwaka sets a new standard for provincial accountability and reinforces the importance of reporting as a tool for inclusive and sustainable development across Papua New Guinea."
Students producing weapons in technical schools,6/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4757,,Society,Sadness,Nill,"A family is still grappling with the shock of losing their son; a young man filled with hopes and dreams.
The Grade 12 student, from Utmei Secondary School, in East New Britain, had around four more months to go before he would close the chapter on secondary education, and move to the next chapter of his life.
Sadly, he succumbed to a head injury on Tuesday, June 3rd, after allegedly being attacked by retaliating students from Don Bosco Technical Secondary School on Thursday, May 29th. This was the final day of the three-day athletics meet at the Kalabond Oval, in Kokopo.
The incident has sparked outrage, with citizens calling for tougher penalties on the perpetrators, who were fined K2,000 by the court on Monday, June 2nd. Failure to meet the fine would lead to one-year detention, each, at Kerevat Prison.
“Parents sacrifice so much to send their children to school, only to see them cut up,” said Rabaul resident and women’s advocate, Susie McGrade.
“And I don’t think there is enough school discipline practiced by the school authorities. Well done to the police for locking everyone up. And they should continue. Not just locking up some but all of them.
“If a student acts with adult criminal intent then they should face adult criminal consequences.
“These sort of incidents are destroying the community. We have now become fractured.
“Vital policy must be made now to avoid such tragic incidents.""
“The parents of this boy must be absolutely devastated and it will take a long time for the community amd the school’s environment to get over this. I am absolutely seriously concerned for us all going forward.”
Prominent national athlete, Takale Tuna, who hails from Matupit, in East New Britain, passed his condolences to the parents and family for the loss of a young life.
“Rather than stopping or suspending school carnivals, investigations must be carried out to find the root cause of such violence,” he outlined.""
“Questions need asking include: What’s motivating young people to resort to violence to solve problems? Why are there so much weapons of destruction in our educational institutions and communities?
“Cultural and Christian values that have been the cornerstone of the ENB society for centuries must be brought back into our classrooms and communities to bring back discipline and respect for authorities. This is to ensure our future generations are well equipped to face challenges they encounter rather than resorting to violence.”
Meantime, Kokopo Police Station Commander, Senior Inspector Neil Weiba, expressed concern that technical students have been using school workshops to weld or construct weapons.
“They have been modifying weapons, homemade guns and other offensive weapons which we have found at that time and confiscated,” he stated, alluding to the May 29th altercation that led to the detainment of over 200 students.""
“We found out that all those weapons were made in their workshop. Those weapons were made to kill.""
“I’m blaming the school administration for not properly supervising students.”"
Drug offenders urge to seek legal help,5/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4738,,Law,Sadness,Nill,"District Court drug offenders seeking assistance from the Public Solicitor’s office are urged to represent themselves or seek help from private law firms due to a shortage of lawyers.
Waigani District Court Magistrate Tracy Ganaii said this when speaking to a drug offender in court recently.
Upon advice from the Public Solicitor's office, Ganaii said most of the lawyers are attending to National and Supreme Court matters, with limited lawyers to attend to District Court matters.
“So this means that you will have to represent yourself in court or seek help from a private lawyer to assist you in court,” she said.
She said the purpose of the court is to appeal to drug offenders to seek help due to the increasing number of drug cases that are piling up in court.
“The court needs the assistance of lawyers and prosecutors to identify the facts of the cases, and also identify the effects of drugs in society, as well as the individual circumstances of the offender.
The court must balance it out and make a fair decision.
“There are various reasons for using drugs, some take drugs to sell, others take drugs to smoke. However, the penalties for offenses involving drugs have increased, therefore, offenders need representation to represent them in court,” Magistrate Ganaii added."
ACT NOW demands action on log export price discrepancy,5/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4735,,Business,Anger,Nill,"Community advocacy organisation ACT NOW is calling on the Prime Minister and regulatory agencies to take urgent action to address the huge discrepancies in log export values revealed in a recent report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
The UNODC findings, which are based on official PNG log export monitoring reports and Chinese customs data, show that foreign-owned logging companies could be defrauding the PNG government and resource owners out of billions of Kina in revenues.
The report reveals that the value of logs exported from PNG, as declared by the logging companies, is 50 per cent lower than the value of the same logs as declared in China by the importing companies.
From 2018 to 2022, the difference in value between the prices declared in PNG and those in China totaled US$1.5 billion, equivalent to over K6 billion at today’s exchange rate.
By undervaluing the logs exported from PNG, logging companies evade paying export taxes to the government and royalties to local communities, as well as corporate taxes by not declaring any profits.
The evidence from the UNODC report echoes comments from the Commissioner of the IRC, Sam Koim, who said in 2021 that logging companies are guilty of “an entrenched level of tax evasion” with “egregious incidents of transfer pricing and under declaration of income.”
“The amounts of money involved are eye-watering,” says ACT NOW Campaign Manager Eddie Tango.
“And the losses to the PNG government and rural communities have been ongoing for decades. It is time for the Prime Minister himself to step in and ensure action is taken.”
ACT NOW is also calling for immediate action by regulatory agencies, the commercial sector and the diplomatic community, including:
•	PNG Forest Authority to stop issuing any further log export permits until a public inquiry is completed;
•	Police fraud squad with the assistance of UNODC and IRC, to open criminal investigations into logging companies suspected of defrauding the State and landowners
•	Commercial banks to stop providing financial services to foreign-owned logging companies
•	Foreign missions, including Japan, EU, France, UK and Australia to support the PNG government in setting up a public inquiry.
“There is extensive and well-documented evidence that logging companies are involved in illegal logging, including the abuse of Forest Clearing Authorities, tax evasion and fraud, money laundering and human rights abuses,” says Eddie Tanago.
“These same problems were revealed in the Barnet Commission of Inquiry way back in 1989 and have plagued our nation since Independence.”
“It is time for the PM, government departments, and commercial banks, with the assistance and support of our overseas friends to bring an end to this scandal.”"
Manning congratulates recruits,5/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4736,,Government,Trust,Nill,"The Police Commissioner, David Manning, congratulated 226 new members of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary as they graduated from the Bomana Police Training College on Monday.
Following six months of intensive training, Commissioner Manning called on the graduates to always honour the oath they swore to serve Papua New Guinea's people.
""These young men and women graduating today (Monday) have demonstrated the commitment, discipline, and determination required to join the frontline of policing,"" the Commissioner said.
""They now take their place in serving communities across the country at a time when law and order remains a priority for the Marape-Rosso Government.
""These graduates represent a broad cross-section of the nation, with recruits drawn from nearly all provinces across Papua New Guinea.
""Among this second graduating class of this year are 25 women, reflecting the Constabulary's ongoing commitment to increasing gender representation within the organisation.""
The Commissioner highlighted that this week's graduation brings the RPNGC's workforce to nearly 7,000 members, as part of a major recruitment and reform program to strengthen policing capability nationwide.
""We are well on track to meet our target of 10,000 full-time Police personnel this decade.
A further recruit intake will commence training in mid-June, with another intake scheduled for the third quarter of this year.
""At the same time, our Police Reservist recruitment program continues to expand our reach, particularly into rural and remote communities.""
Commissioner Manning thanked the Government for its ongoing investment in the Constabulary's modernisation efforts, including training, resourcing, and international partnerships.
In closing, the Commissioner spoke directly to the new Police personnel, reminding them of what is expected of them.
""Wear your uniform with pride, serve with honour, and always remember the trust placed in you by the people of this nation and execute your authority with diligence and fairness."""
Kikori police handicap to attend to SARV incident,5/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4733,,Local,Fear,Nill,"Kikori Police on Sunday, June 2, 2025, released a report of a Sorcery Accusation Related Violence (SARV) incident where four elderly men were murdered.
The men from various villages within East Kikori, Gulf Province, were killed by the people from Veraibari village on Sunday, May 25, after suspecting them of practicing sorcery.
According to a police report, the community of Veraibari brought the four elderly men, who had been suspected and known for practicing sorcery to be questioned concerning the death of many young men, women and children of Veraibari village (since 2011), and more recently on Friday 23rd May 2025 they buried another young man who they believed died of malaria.
It is alleged that from 2020-2025, a total of 15 people died through sorcery-related accusations.
During the interrogation, the elderly men admitted they had been practicing sorcery to kill these people. They (deceased men) admitted to using crocodiles, dogs, mosquitoes, and snakes to make people sick and cause death to people through sorcery. A long list, containing names of people whom they had killed and those yet to be killed through sorcery, was revealed.
The angry and frustrated relatives and families then used bush knives to chop the men, killing them instantly.
Six local community-based constables (CBCs), who were present to stop the incident were outnumbered, resulting in the death of the men.
Since reporting the incident, the CBCs informed the Kikori police personnel who visited the crime scene and compiled the reports. However, relatives of those killed are yet to come forward to provide statements.
Meanwhile, policemen lack logistics to move within the area to investigate the incident, which remains tense at the moment, according to Gulf Provincial Police Commander, Chief Inspector Jeffrey Lemb.
“It is highly likely there will be tensions between the families of the deceased and the people of Veraibari.
“This is a killing with a bizarre twist. All four men were killed on account of sorcery. It is likely that the next village is going to attack the Veraibari village in revenge. The problem on the ground with the police is fuel. Kikori police have not received fuel from the police headquarters for the last several months,” said PPC Lemb.
“This is only going to get worse if the police cannot get the needed fuel as soon as possible.”
He said Kikori police get fuel directly from the headquarters transport because there is a cargo boat that makes monthly trips from Port Moresby.
“The company helps to freight them. The boat has been waiting, but Transport officers haven't responded to our request for the last two weeks. Follow-ups have been made daily, but we’re still waiting.”"
Advantage of road links,5/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4731,,Politics,Fear,"Casmiro Aia, James Marape, Powes Parkop","The linking of roads through Connect PNG will bring people back to their homes, and not just bring more people into the city.
These were the words of Prime Minister James Marape during his response to the Member for Goilala, Casmiro Aia, yesterday in parliament.
Aia was concerned about the discrimination in the city where the people of Goilala have been singled out and targeted by various ethnic groups in the city, the latest being the Waigani incident.
“My people were mistreated at Vadavada, 2-Mile Hill, Tete, Baruni Dump recently, at Bomana, and now at Waigani. Tell me, where is the safest place I can take my people to, if not here, then where?”
Prime Minister James Marape, in an attempt to answer his question, outlined how the Connect PNG program will open up Port Moresby to the Momase and Highlands region through the Trans-National Highway and help in the movement of people back to their provinces of origin.
“Today, you look at a city of millions of people, that is why we are opening our country by roads.
“This is not only to bring people into the city, to our Nation’s capital and surrounding provinces like Gulf and Central, but we will stop people from settling there.
“These roads should get people out who have been in the city for years, some even in their 4-5 generations of families.”
With the frustration of Goilala MPs' question on where his people should be located to find safety, MP Marape stated that people of Goilala should consider going back home, and said this goes generally to all who are unemployed in the city.
“If you have nothing to do in our city, there is enough land in your ancestral home. The opening of the road from Port Moresby to Lae should bring people home.
“I want to thank the member and his district for investing in the two main roads leading to the Goilala mountains. This road is supported by the Works Department. If Port Moresby residency is not good for you, there is always a place in your home, place of origin, where everything is free, you can go to.
“For the 4th-5th generation from Tari or other parts of the country living in the city, when the road opens, if you cannot work in the city, go back home.”
The ""Connect PNG"" program aims to improve infrastructure, particularly roads, to connect remote areas and potentially address unemployment by creating opportunities in rural areas. By linking rural communities to economic centers, the program hopes to facilitate access to essential services and markets, encouraging unemployed individuals to return to their home areas and participate in the local economy.
Furthermore, Prime Minister Marape commended the NCD Governor, Powes Parkop, for installing cameras all over the city.
He said by 2027, Port Moresby and all parts of the country must have cameras, including a link to the Police stations. In this way, there will be a real-time response to incidents."

Motor vehicle owners warned,4/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4726,,Safety,Fear,Nill,"Private vehicle owners, PMV operators and Taxi operators are warned to follow basic road safety rules when using public roads in the city, says NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab.
In a statement released earlier, NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Simatab says the ignorance of motor vehicle operations is causing fear in the community, leading to growing danger and disorder in the city.
He said that too many defective and unroadworthy vehicles are causing traffic jams and putting lives at risk, while many are ignoring basic road safety rules, which he said must stop.
Simatab said the command is giving a public notice to allow all drivers and vehicle owners to fix their vehicles or remove them from the road before the police take action effective this week, police will undergo awareness and follow up with arrests and penalties afterwards. He warned vehicle owners to check their cars, PMVs, and taxis.
“If your vehicle is defective, has no brakes, no lights, no registration, or is not roadworthy, take it off the road immediately. This is their chance to fix it before police enforcement begins. Every police officer in NCD — from the Metropolitan Superintendent down to the last Constable — has been instructed to make 5 arrests every month, starting with traffic offences.
He said under the new Road Traffic Act, bail for each traffic offence is K500. He said if one offender is caught and charged with 10 traffic offences, the bail will be K5,000.
The Metsupt said this is a final warning, and police officers will not tolerate the misconduct of motor vehicle owners if caught by the police.
""To every driver, respect the road. Respect other people’s lives. Drive responsibly. Let’s work together to make our roads safer, cleaner, and less congested for everyone, especially our school children, working mothers, and elderly citizens,” Metsupt Simatab said."
Marape commits to ICAC amid leadership dispute,4/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4724,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has reaffirmed his government’s commitment to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), amid internal leadership tensions between the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioners of the newly formed institution.
He confirmed that the ICAC Appointments Committee which comprises the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice, the Leader of the Opposition, Chairman of the Public Services Commission, and Chairman of the PNG Council of Churches — have met to deliberate on the matter and sought legal advice from the State Solicitor and the Department of Justice.
The Prime Minister has assured the nation that the committee is treating this matter with utmost seriousness and asked the citizens not to lose faith in the institution.
Citing the stringent process they followed to establish this institution, he said it is disheartening that the very individuals selected through a rigorous and internationally supervised process are now entangled in internal disputes that is compromising the institution’s integrity.
The ICAC Appointments Committee IAC has now been directed to prepare a detailed report, legal guidance reviewed, and a formal paper submitted to Cabinet for consideration.
Once recommendations are endorsed, the Cabinet will take swift and responsible action to restore stability within ICAC.
“This institution must not fall. It was created to be a cornerstone in the fight against corruption, not a battleground of personalities and power struggles. We will treat this situation as a structural learning curve and take steps to strengthen ICAC’s leadership and governance frameworks,” said Prime Minister Marape.
He stated that the Government is committed to ensuring ICAC operates with full clarity and independence, alongside the Ombudsman Commission, Police, and other state agencies"

The young man tragically lost his life yesterday (Tuesday, June 3rd) after he was rushed to the hospital with an injury sustained from an attack by students from the Don Bosco Technical Secondary School.
The incident occurred on Thursday, May 29th, during the 2025 Inter-school Athletics Carnival, which was hosted at the Kalabond Oval in Kokopo.

“The main charge that covered 134 students was ‘in possession of offensive weapons’ while one was charged separately for having a homemade gun with ammunitions and drugs as well,” this newsroom was told.
“It’s very serious for students at that age to be in possession of such weapons.”
PSC Weiba further voiced his concern that technical students have been using school workshops to weld or construct weapons.
“They have been modifying weapons, homemade guns and other offensive weapons which we have found at that time and confiscated,” he outlined.
“We found out that all those weapons were made in their workshop. Those weapons were made to kill.

ENB challenged on 48th anniversary,3/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4703,,Local,Anticipation,Nill,"The people of East New Britain have been challenged to be agents of change.
ENB Provincial Administrator, Levi Mano, issued the challenge during the commemoration of the East New Britain Provincial Government’s 48th anniversary on Friday, May 31st.
“As you've heard from previous speakers, I don’t think any government program can create change unless the people take it upon themselves to be agents of change,” Mano said.
He urged everyone through the livestreamed program via NBC East New Britain, to get back to the basics of life.
“To the young people in the province, I don't know what good will come from you not listening to your parents and leaders in the community. Because disobedience only leads to bad things happening to you in life,” he outlined.
Mano also encouraged youths to have self respect and to go back to the church.
Representing all the national leaders in the province, Kokopo MP, Ereman Tobaining Junior, said the province’s history tells a story of people’s resilience.
He urged ENB citizens, and especially the younger generation, to be proud that ENB, through its community leaders, started the movement for self rule in the province, which eventually led to PNG gaining independence in 1975.
""To our youths today, we need to change our way of thinking. Likewise parents, your children are your core responsibility, so go back to fixing your family homes first.”
The program initially had additional activities, such as the Choral Festival and presentation of items such as trucks, but that had to be omitted, given some issues experienced at the venue during the week, amidst the inter-secondary school carnival at the Takubar Sports grounds in Kokopo city.
Instead, the program only featured the ENB Scout Association with two choir groups from Navunaram and Kabakada villages from Gazelle district. They choir presentation accompanied speeches from the two leaders, and others such as the provincial church representative and the acting provincial advisor for the Division of Community Development.
Takubar sports grounds was the fallback venue after Gazelle District, as the host of the program, could not prepare in time."

Nanei highlighted that Aropa was once an international airport, thus it is the desire of the ABG to request accessibility requesting for the national government to open up the skies for international flights into Aropa come 2027 when the project is complete.
He stated also that trade is already taking place between the people of Bougainville and Solomon Islands, the airport will provide the opportunity for formal arrangements that will ensure better control and monitoring measures that will transform Bougainville.
However, the project was not launched without dissatisfaction voiced by South Nasioi Community Government Chairman Landowner Representative, Thomas Dunilu at the event recalled that in 2014, the amount of K1 million in business grants was promised to the landowners of the six sub clans. These funds have never been disbursed. Prime Minister Marape at the event acknowledged this grievance and stated that was the first he had heard of such commitment, he said he would seek answers regarding the matter.
Meantime, President Ishmael Toroama appealed to the landowners to clear the land to allow for the expansion of the airport, encouraging the people to create a strong work culture. He stated further that the land on which the airport is located is the site for one of the last battles between PNG security forces and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) during the crisis that lasted from 1988 to 1998.
He said the battle lasted six days and ended on the morning of the 7th day. The president says there is need for reconciliation between PNG and Bougainville, proposing a traditional kaikai (gathering) for a later date.
“This place has history.”
“We have to rebuild Bougainville.”
While Prime Minister James Marape assured President Toroama and the people of Bougainville continued collaboration between the national government and the ABG, stating, “As high as Mt Wilhelm is, the aspirations of Bougainville as locked in through the referendum process will forever remain in time into the future.”"

This development was confirmed during a community consultation and awareness program, hosted by JICA and the East New Britain Provincial Administration, at Karavi Village, Kokopo Vunamami Local-Level Government (LLG), on Monday, May 26.
The road project, to be fully funded by JICA, will commence at Butuwin in Karavi and extend to Ranguna Bridge. It includes the construction of two new bridges at Karavi and Ranguna wards to improve accessibility in flood-prone areas.
The ENB Provincial Administration’s Advisor for the Division of Land, Joyce Guan, explained that the meeting was part of a broader series of stakeholder consultations aimed at informing local communities about the project’s objectives and scope.
“The road rehabilitation is part of the Kokopo-Rabaul Infrastructure Development Plan (KRIDP), which was approved by the project steering committee and presented to the Ambassador of Japan and the Secretary of the Department of Works and Highways in May 2024,” Ms. Guan said.
“JICA has taken up the project from the KRIDP and we are currently in the early consultation phase.”
Ms Guan said several meetings have already been conducted, and the final one is scheduled for September.
She added that project timelines and funding details will be finalised upon completion of feasibility studies and community consultations.
The existing two-lane road will be maintained with minor developments planned inland and toward the beachfront.
Ms Guan said a team of slope engineers is presently conducting soil and rock sampling as part of the feasibility study.
Meanwhile, the social and environmental team, including Ms. Guan, is advancing awareness and community engagement efforts.
Deputy Provincial Administrator – Corporate Services, John Talele, commended community members for their participation and support.
“This project will help address recurring issues like flooding and soil erosion that severely affect the Karavi and Ranguna areas,” he said.
“Heavy rainfall often renders the road closed, delaying public transport services and cargo from Rabaul. This rehabilitation work will significantly improve travel and delivery times.”
Tiolam Wawaga, local leader and former LLG president of Raluana LLG, urged residents to support the implementation team.
“I encourage all of us to respect and assist those working on this project. Attracting development partners like JICA to our province is no easy task, so let’s work together to ensure its success.”

The Ministry of Education expresses its gratitude to the Marape/Rosso Government for its undivided support for a World Bank Loan and extends its heartfelt appreciation to the World Bank for its recent approval and release of US$100 million (K406 million) in funding to support the Learning Enhancement and Access Project (LEAP) in Papua New Guinea.
The Learning Enhancement and Access Project (LEAP) is a transformative initiative that aims to improve learning outcomes for children across the country, targeting the foundational years - that is, ECE preparatory, grade 1, and 2.
This critical investment will directly support an estimated 3,500 schools, benefiting approximately 375,000 preparatory to grade 2 and 9,000 teachers, ensuring that every child has the opportunity to thrive in an environment that nurtures their potential.
LEAP will focus on four key pillars:
Preparing children to be ready to learn:
The project will support pilot Early Childhood Education (ECE) initiatives, laying a strong foundation for future learning and aligning with the government’s commitment to expand and formalize ECE in the national education system.
Supporting teachers to teach effectively: LEAP will provide high-quality teaching and learning materials, extensive professional development, and teacher qualification upgrading to equip teachers with the skills and resources they need to succeed.
Modernizing infrastructure and management:
Recognizing the importance of safe, well-equipped learning environments, the project will invest in refurbishing school infrastructure, improving data management systems, and enhancing overall governance in the education sector.
Strengthening project management and capacity-building:
LEAP will support the Department of Education in building strong systems and human resource capacity to ensure effective delivery, monitoring, and sustainability of project activities.
Education Minister Lucas Dekena said this funding shows the World Bank’s trust in our plans for education.
“LEAP will help our teachers and children, and bring hope to communities across Papua New Guinea. Once again, I thank the World Bank for standing with us to improve the future of our children.
“We look forward to signing the agreements and formally launching the project in the coming weeks,” he said.
The project represents the first phase of a 12-year Multiphase Programmatic Approach (MPA), designed to be a scalable and sustainable pathway to achieve significant education reforms and ultimately improve learning outcomes across the country.
LEAP is aligned with the Government’s National Education Plan 2020-2029, the Medium-Term Development Plan IV 2023-27, and the country’s commitment to Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all).
The Ministry of Education also acknowledges the ongoing efforts to secure additional funding through the $50 million OPEC Fund and the approximately $10 million grant from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which will bring the total project funding to approximately $160 million once finalized."
Northern Province imposes liquor restrictions,2/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4690,,Politics,Fear,Gary Juffa,"Ten thousand kina is the fine for non-compliance with liquor restrictions during the LLG elections. The Oro Provincial Government and administration have imposed this in preparation for the 2025 LLG elections.
Provincial administrator Trevor Magei issued this stern warning in light of law and order data obtained from the Provincial Police Command, with a very high frequency of major violent crimes relating to alcohol abuse in the province.
Northern province has been marred by a spike in violent crimes, including 14 murders recorded in May alone, mainly associated with alcohol abuse.
“With guidance from the Provincial Police Command, the Provincial Peace and Good Order committee has unanimously resolved for stringent alcohol trading hours to be implemented and policed during the pre- and post-25 LLG Elections in Oro,” said Magei.
Alcohol restrictions, according to a circular from the Office of the Provincial Administrator, include Monday to Thursday trading restrictions from 0800am to 4 pm or 1600, and a total ban on alcohol trading from Friday to Sunday.
Magei confirmed that licensed outlets that serve alcohol with meals are exempt but must adhere to the no take-away alcohol policy.
“Licensed outlets are allowed to serve alcohol with meals, but patrons are not allowed to take away any alcohol bought from these licensed premises, or they stand to lose their trading Licenses indefinitely,” said Magei.
Northern Governor Gary Juffa has endorsed this measure primarily because of the importance of ordinary citizens to exercise their Constitutional rights to freely cast their votes without fear or intimidation from intoxicated persons or groups.
“This is the one time in five years ordinary citizens are allowed to freely and unintimated privilege to exercise their constitutional right, and my Provincial Government is committed to ensuring this is not derailed by intoxicated political hooliganism,” said Juffa.
“Northern Province does not have a lot of funding, in fact, we are stretched to the limit, but my Provincial Government recognises that for development to be proficiently delivered, there must be functioning Local Level Governments, and OPG funding emulates this message, said Juffa
“I can assure the national and provincial governments, Northern Province is ready for the start of polling come July 27, 2025 and further,” Juffa added."

"RTA takes over vehicle registration, driver licensing",2/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4699,,Government,Trust,Nill,"Obtaining or renewing driver’s licences and motor vehicle registration in the Nation’s Capital has become much simpler today with the Road Traffic Authority (RTA) now responsible for these services.
The Government has brought in the reform to be compliant with the Road Traffic Act 2014 and the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Insurance) Act 1974.
In a statement released today, RTA’s Acting Chief Executive Officer, John Avira, said the transition of responsibilities provides motorists with clarity for licensing and registration, and will be rolled out around the nation.
As of 2 June 2025, RTA is the sole authority for:
• New and renewed vehicle registrations;
• Issuance of number plates and changes to ownership, colour, engine or chassis;
• Licensing of all vehicle classes, including PMVs and taxis;
• Driver’s license issuance, upgrades, renewals, and reprints;
• Provision of registration-related consumables (e.g., handbooks, special plates).
Mr Avira said this reform will enable the RTA to focus on our core functions for the public, and Motor Vehicle Insurance Limited’s (MVIL) will focus solely on providing Compulsory Third-Party motor vehicle insurance.
“We all want to ensure that motorists know where to go for the services they need and make life easier in complying with legal requirements.
“MVIL has done a great job in administering these responsibilities since 1996, now RTA is stepping up and taking up these important licensing and registration functions.
“The transition begins in the National Capital District and will expand around the nation.”
Following the transition, all MVIL-issued driver licences and vehicle registration certificates remain valid until their current expiry. Upon expiration, renewals must be completed through RTA.
Vehicles must first be insured by MVIL before being registered or re-registered with RTA.
RTA stated that the legal requirement for Compulsory Third Party insurance has not changed and must be obtained through MVIL before registration or renewal with RTA. Insurance only becomes active once the vehicle is successfully registered.
With the transition only being for NCD, the MVIL will continue its registration and licensing partnerships with provincial governments, except where the function has already been internalised, such as is the case in Morobe, Milne Bay and West New Britain."

DCP Yamasombi, while thanking the RPNGC management for presenting three new vehicles to the National Fraud Squad Directorate on Friday, May 30, 2025, stated that police officers need vehicles to move around, collect evidence, pick up eyewitnesses, and conduct crime scene investigations.
He said the new vehicles for the National Fraud Division are a bonus for them to boost their work performance.
The Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) for Logistics, Chris Smith, while presenting the vehicles, said this is a part of the re-fleeting initiative, RPNGC is undergoing to do away with hired cars.
He said hired cars had used up a lot of money that was supposed to be used for other things, like renovating barracks or taking care of the police officers' welfare.
ACP Smith also challenged the officers to make sure the vehicles are brought in for service when they are due for one. He said that is the only way the vehicles will be looked after and will serve their purpose for a long period.

Police Commissioner David Manning confirmed on Saturday, May 31st, receipt of a formal referral from ICAC Commissioner Andrew Forbes about the conduct of the senior officers.
The referral includes allegations of financial irregularities and expenditure of public monies not approved by an officer authorised under the Public Finances (Management) Act 1995.
In accordance with established procedures, initial enquiries are being conducted by the Police to inform consideration of the referral by the Sensitive Investigation Board. Where the Sensitive Investigation Board assesses a referral as disclosing suspicion of a criminal offence, the matter will be assigned for independent investigation by the National Fraud & Anti-Corruption Directorate.
It is the expectation of the RPNGC and the Government that all matters relating to the transparent and legal management of public entities be held to the highest standards and scrutiny.
The ICAC was established by the National Parliament to combat corrupt conduct by public officials, public bodies, and corruption by individuals who may receive government funds.
Commissioner Manning said it is appropriate that the anti-corruption watchdog adheres to the expectations of the nation and refers any concerns of its personnel for independent and transparent scrutiny.
“As in all claims made in a referral to the police, any accused is innocent until proven guilty in a Court of law.
“I issue this statement as notice to other parties not to attempt to politicise the work of law enforcement agencies of the nation,” Manning said.
ICAC Commissioner Forbes wishes to make clear that it will not be naming the individuals involved at this stage, to uphold due process and avoid prejudicing ongoing inquiries.
He said ICAC acknowledges and appreciates the support of key government authorities who have been instrumental in ensuring this matter was managed promptly with professionalism and discretion.
Commissioner Forbes reiterates that he does not tolerate misconduct at any level, and when serious allegations arise, they will be subject to appropriate scrutiny."

He expressed pride in witnessing the sport's growth at the grassroots level, emphasizing that such developments highlight the success of the Central Dabaris franchise.
Additionally, Iduhu noted the franchise’s contributions to rugby league in Papua New Guinea, mentioning the emergence of talented players such as Wallen Tau-Loi, a quality second-rower, and fullback Morea Morea Junior, both of whom have made significant impacts in the sport.
The competition will feature open men’s and women’s divisions, along with school categories, fostering participation across diverse demographics. The Hiri-West Zone tournament marks a pivotal moment in promoting rugby league and engaging communities in meaningful sports activities.
As the weeks progress, anticipation builds for the talent and competition that will unfold, leading to the crowning of the district champions."
National Lands Board Chairman Appointment Pending,31/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4671,,Government,Anticipation,"John Rosso, Rufina Peter","With Central Province now having a Physical Planning Board with its chairman in place, Governor Rufina Peter is further calling on the Lands Department to fast track the appointment of the National Lands Board Chairman.
The Lands Act and the Physical Planning Act are the legislations that enable the establishment of the Provincial Lands Board and the Physical Planning Board for provinces.
Physical Planning boards are established under the Physical Planning Act 1989 and are responsible for approving all proposed development plans within the province. They ensure that these plans conform to best land use practices. Whilst a Lands Board is established under the Land Act 1996 and is responsible for managing and allocating land within the province.
The Central Provincial Physical Planning Board members and the Chairman were sworn in last week, following the swearing in of the provincial lands board last year. However, for these boards to fully function and exercise their powers, they need the National Lands Board. And currently, there is a vacancy in the role of the National Land’s Board Chairman.
Therefore, Governor Peter brought this to the attention of the minister responsible.
“These two boards are fundamental to integrated and coherent land development strategies. While the Central Provincial Land Board was sworn in lasty year, we still await the appointment of the National Land Board Chairman to officiate as required under the Land Act. We kindly ask for your support to expedite this appointment and provide ongoing resourcing for both Boards to operate effectively.”
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Lands and Physical Planning and Urbanization, John Rosso, confirmed that the appointment of the National Lands Board Chairman will take place soon.
“Regarding the questions that was raised earlier on, the chairman of the National Land board, the national land board has already been appointed by cabinet and just waiting to be sworn in. It should be sworn in within the next couple of days, and they can carry out the work of all the working closely with your provincial board.”"
EU-STREIT program transforms rural livelihoods,31/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4669,,Development,Joy,Nill,"The rural community of Maka in West Sepik Province is undergoing a powerful transformation, thanks to the EU-STREIT PNG Programme.
Plagued by low agricultural productivity, lack of market access, and limited services, life in Maka was marked by hardship. Families like Joseph and Damia faced constant struggles—finding school fees, nutritious food, and income was a daily challenge. But the tide has turned.
The EU-STREIT PNG Programme, funded by the European Union and implemented by UN agencies, introduced critical support to revitalise cocoa and aquaculture production. Farmers received pest-tolerant cocoa seedlings, training in cocoa budding and post-harvest practices, and vital equipment including nursery materials and fermentry kits. Over 4,000 cocoa seedlings have now been planted by 40 farmers, breathing new life into Maka’s block fields.
In June 2024, aquaculture support followed, with fingerlings provided to Joseph and Damia, enabling them to grow from one to three fishponds and supply nearby farmers. This has improved local nutrition and created a new income stream.
Market access has also been restored. A new Cocoa Trade and Depot Facility in Vanimo now connects Maka’s produce to buyers, with trucks delivering supplies and transporting cocoa beans. Maka farmers can now process beans in their own fermentry, adding value and boosting profits.
Beyond the economic gains, the programme has reignited hope and self-reliance. Damia’s message to her children is clear: “Do well to have a good future.”
With the Cocoa Board now supporting the nursery and West Sepik Investment Ltd managing the depot facility, the foundation is set for long-term sustainability.
Maka’s transformation is a powerful example of rural revitalisation through resilience, partnership, and strategic investment—aligning with the EU’s Global Gateway vision for inclusive development."

Autopsy report out – Sandy’s family still shocked,31/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4673,,Crime,Anger,De Kewanu,"Six days on and the family of late Sandy Purel are yet to come to terms with her death as shock and grief grips the family.
“We the relatives in the strongest term condemn the way and the manner in which she was killed. It was ruthless, gutless, reckless, action by a rogue and undisciplined policeman. This is the way we would describe it because no human being in the right sense of mind would carry out such an act.
“So this is something that the family cannot take.”
“And for a 29-years old, for her life to go in this manner, it is unacceptable. We cannot comprehend. We are not sure if a normal person did it.”
This is not the end they wanted – all they invested in their daughter for 29 year,  gone in the blink of an eye - at the pull of a trigger from the hand of a trigger-happy policeman.
Morata Bus Stop at Waigani in the nation’s capital was business as usual on that fateful Sunday (25 May 2025) afternoon. The spot was bustling with informal business activities as citizens went about their daily tasks to earn a living in this demanding city.
Sandy and her husband, married just a month ago had returned from Church and were waiting to board the next PMV home to Morata. Unbeknownst to them, tragedy was about to strike.
A police vehicle approached hastily, and everyone was taking cover, especially the informal sellers.  As Sandy and her husband scrambled in the mad rush, Sandy fell and would never rise again to say even a final goodbye.
Autopsy reports revealed the bullet hit her on the right shoulder, penetrated through her chest and out the left shoulder, damaging vital organs in the process.
“So yesterday (Thursday, 29th May), our doctor performed an autopsy or what you call a post-mortem. And I just want the nation to know the cause of the death as per the death certificate that was issued to us and the police.
“Its lacerated trachea, lung bullet wounds and collapsed lungs due to penetrating bullet wound to the right shoulder due to gun shot,” outlined the family spokesman, De Kewanu.
This report weighed down heavily on the family, who have now come out to demand answers from the police.
They want answers on why a gun was used in a public place where there was no imminent danger or threat, there was no fighting or commotion, and what danger the environment there posed for them to use a gun.
“Was there an imminent threat on someone or the policeman’s life? You’re not in a war-torn zone or some centres that are rife with tribal fights. Then you can go armed. But for someone who was minding her own business on a Sunday and for someone to pull the trigger: what threat did she pose? What threat the environment posed? What threat was around for someone to press a trigger? That we can’t take it,” Kewanu stated.
Following her death and after leaving her body at the funeral home, truck loads of men convoyed to the Waigani police station demanding answers.
However, the situation was fast contained as they agreed to allow law to take its course.
“We are from a region where the word of God has settled in a place called Upper Mendi. Let me put it this way - the people that live up there, our DNA is peace. That DNA has overtaken these men here. That DNA has overtaken that society. That DNA called peace has given us five days to come this far. Tell the police hierarchy, tell the nation, tell the police minister, tell the police commissioner that this DNA called peace generates out from these young men that are seated here. Tell the policemen that we visited at almost midnight at Waigani police station in a convoy of vehicles. Tell the nation that that DNA I am speaking about prevailed that night so Port Moresby can be at ease,” Kewanu said.
Kewanu is now calling on the police hierarchy to come forward and provide some explanation. Six days on and he says there is a lack of police presence at the funeral venue.
Labelling the death as one induced by police, they now demand the police department to take on all expenses related to the death."
Mineral Resource Madang delivers ambulance to Bundi,30/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4663,,Health,Joy,Nill,"Mineral Resources Madang (MRM), a subsidiary of the Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC), has delivered a fully kitted ambulance to serve the people of Ward 22 in the Bundi district of Madang Province.

PNG Updates Earthquake Design Standards,30/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4662,,Infrastructure,Trust,Nill,"Papua New Guinea has taken a major step toward safer infrastructure with the conclusion of a high-level workshop aimed at reviewing and updating the country’s Earthquake Engineering
Design Standards for bridges. Held in Port Moresby, the workshop was led by the Department of Works and facilitated by international and local engineering experts.
Works Secretary Gibson Holemba delivered closing remarks, commending engineers, consultants, and development partners for their contributions. He described the updated design standards as more than just technical refinements—they represent a national commitment to safeguarding lives, protecting investments, and building a resilient future.
Papua New Guinea lies in a geologically active region and is highly susceptible to seismic events. The existing bridge infrastructure is increasingly vulnerable to earthquakes, prompting the urgent need for updated, scientifically grounded engineering practices.
The three-day workshop was facilitated by Geoscience Australia, Becca Consultants, and Kings Consultants, and supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the Australian High Commission (AHC). The gathering brought together engineers, technical specialists, researchers, and development stakeholders from across the country and abroad.
Key Outcomes:
The revised earthquake design standards are tailored to PNG’s unique seismic, terrain, and geotechnical conditions, ensuring greater durability and safety
The new standards align PNG’s engineering practices with global best practices, while maintaining relevance to local construction challenges.
These updates are intended to be institutionalized into national engineering codes, construction practices, and regulatory frameworks.
The workshop directly supports national goals under Vision 2050, the National Transport Strategy, and the Connect PNG Program.
“What we’ve achieved here goes beyond technical standards—this is about protecting lives, safeguarding our infrastructure, and ensuring our bridges withstand the shocks of tomorrow. It is both a professional obligation and a moral responsibility.”
Infrastructure plays a crucial role in connecting communities, enabling economic growth, and ensuring safety. With updated seismic design principles, Papua New Guinea is positioning itself to build stronger, safer, and longer-lasting bridges that can better withstand the unpredictable forces of nature.
These developments also reflect a growing emphasis on climate resilience and disaster preparedness in national infrastructure planning.
The Department of Works acknowledged the vital support of development partners, academic institutions, and international experts. The collaboration between Australian and Papua New Guinean engineers and agencies reflects a shared commitment to regional resilience and engineering excellence.
As the workshop concluded, Secretary Holemba called on all engineers and practitioners to carry the momentum forward by embedding the revised standards into daily practice. He said the real work begins now—turning policies into projects and standards into safeguards for every community that depends on PNG’s road and bridge networks.
The Department of Works will be working with stakeholders in the coming months to disseminate the new standards across provinces and incorporate them into training, regulation, and upcoming projects."

IRC uncovers disturbing pattern to evade tax,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4651,,Business,Anger,Nill,"The Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) has uncovered a disturbing pattern among certain companies in Papua New Guinea: the deliberate inflation of Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) to understate profits and evade taxes. This deceptive practice not only distorts commercial reality but also undermines the fairness of the tax system and disadvantages honest businesses.
COGS inflation typically involves overstating the cost of acquiring or producing goods—through fictitious purchases, inflated supplier invoices, or misclassified personal expenses—to reduce declared profits and, ultimately, lower tax payable. In effect, some entities are masking real sales figures behind manipulated expenses.
This is tax evasion, and IRC states it will not be tolerated.
To address this growing concern, the IRC has initiated a targeted compliance campaign, anchored by a comprehensive COGS Benchmarking Project. The project aims to establish industry-specific benchmarks—such as typical COGS-to-sales ratios— for sectors including wholesale, retail, hospitality, and construction. These benchmarks serve as a diagnostic tool to identify companies whose reported figures fall outside normal industry ranges.
In tandem with the benchmarking initiative, the IRC has also begun requesting detailed COGS breakdowns and supporting documents from selected businesses. However, many responses have been evasive or incomplete, with companies citing the absence of proper accounting records—an alarming breach of legal obligations.
This conduct is in direct contravention of the following provisions under the Income Tax Act 1959:
•	Section 364(2): Businesses must maintain sufficient income and expenditure records in English, within Papua New Guinea, for at least seven years.
•	Section 365: Failure to maintain such records may amount to obstructing access to essential documents.
•	Section 320: Knowingly understating income or misrepresenting facts in tax returns is a criminal offence.
The IRC warns that:
•	Claims based on inflated COGS will be disallowed.
•	Offenders will be subjected to penalties, including criminal prosecution where applicable.
•	Persistent non-compliance will result in escalated enforcement actions, including risk-based audits and public disclosure where appropriate.
Commissioner General Sam Koim urges all businesses to uphold transparency and integrity in their financial reporting.
“We are now building an evidence-based tax administration, and data does not lie,” he stated.
“Our benchmarking and analytics systems are already flagging anomalies, and we will follow every lead.”
He added, “We have started to pluck revenue leakages, and this is one such risk area that has been identified, hence this intervention.”
IRC states that it remains firmly committed to protecting government revenue, ensuring fair competition, and rewarding businesses that play by the rules."
K20m investment to improve ease of doing business,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4652,,Business,Anticipation,Richard Maru,"The opportunities for business and investment are bright in the next few years but Papua New Guinea (PNG) needs to improve the ease of doing business and not continue to use old manual systems of facilitating trade processes.
Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru says, “According to the latest World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index, PNG is ranked 120 out of the 190 economies in 2023. The low ranking signifies and attests the stark reality of the inefficient and ineffective trade processes and system of PNG resulting in high cost of trade.”
He added, “The anticipated growth in the economy from trade and investment has not been realized owing to dysfunctional trade processes and systems that are fraught with delays and increased cost of trade as traders contend with the challenges of meeting multiple regulatory requirements from multiple locations. The Marape Government wants to improve our business process to compete with the rest of the world using technology rather than our manual systems.”
The government is working to change its outdated systems.
“We have decided this year that we will commence the acquisition process to acquire an electronic Single Window System. Our government will invest K20 million to acquire and implement this system to increase efficiency and to make us competitive. Work starts this year and PNG Customs Services will be the lead agency,” said Minister Maru.
The electronic Single Window System is a trade facilitation concept which allows an international (cross border) trader to submit required trade information to a single agency using a web-based digital automated portal, rather than having to deal with multiple agencies in multiple locations to obtain necessary papers, permits, and clearance to complete import or export processes, resulting in reduced cost of trade. The pursuit of the concept of electronic Single Window System is to promote a seamless flow of trade, through the automation of trade processes using an electronic online platform for processing Customs declarations, obtaining permits, licenses, and approvals through an electronic online platform.
“The key objective is to automate the trade processes and use an online platform to improve release times with a seamless flow of goods in trade. This will result in increased compliance, increased economic activities, enhanced economic growth through increased international trade, reduce the cost of doing business, improvement in the ease of doing business, increase revenue collections, and effective and collaborative border management,” explained Minister Maru.
“We need everyone to come on board and co-operate so we will have one system to facilitate trade. The Marape-Rosso Government is determined and as the Minister responsible for international trade and investment, I am determined, and I need the support of everyone, including all Government Agencies and the private sector,” said Minister Maru"
CLRC concludes Writing and Research skills training,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4655,,Government,Trust,Nill,"The Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) staff and management have successfully concluded a comprehensive three-day in-house training on Writing and Research Skills, facilitated by CLRC Commissioner Dr. Dora Kuir-Ayius, PhD.
Dr. Ayius, a lecturer at the University of Papua New Guinea's School of Humanities and Social Sciences, emphasized the training's significance in enhancing the development of CLRC publications, including Issues Papers, Discussion Papers, Terms of Reference, and comprehensive reports.
While the training served as a refresher for senior research officers and legal staff, it introduced advanced methodologies and fresh perspectives that are invaluable to the Commission's work.
This vital training strengthens effective research approaches and provides critical writing strategies, enabling officers to produce reliable and credible reports. As the sole independent agency mandated with reviewing and reforming Papua New Guinea's Constitution and offering high-level legal advice to the National Government, the training ensures that CLRC can accurately capture and reflect public views in its recommendations to the National Executive Council.
CLRC Secretary Dr. Mange Matui described the training as essential guidance that aligns directly with the responsibilities of all officers and expressed gratitude to Dr. Ayius for her dedication in achieving the workshop's objectives.
As part of its commitment to continuous professional development, the Commission ensures that relevant training programs are conducted periodically. This approach equips staff and management with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively contribute to law reform and review agendas, thereby enhancing the Commission's capacity to fulfill its mandate."

Yule Island gazette notice not sinister: Rosso,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4656,,Politics,Trust,"John Rosso, Rufina Peter","Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Lands and Physical Planning and Urbanisation, John Rosso, said the Yule Island Gazette notice that was published earlier this year was not sinister and not declare ownership rights of the ancestral land.
A National Gazette notice of intention under Section 37 of the Land Commission Act was published on the 29th of January 2025 to declare Yule Island in Kairuku District, Central Province as National Land.
In the notice, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Lands and Physical Planning and Urbanization, John Rosso, said that it was his intention to declare not earliest than the expiration of three months following the date of the publication of notice in the National Gazette that the land specified in the schedule is;
a)	Government land
b)	Was acquitted before Independence Day by a pre-Independence Administration in PNG and
c)	Being required for public purpose as National Land.
The notice indicated that; All that piece of land containing an area of 670.8 hectares or thereabouts described as Deed of Attestation numbers 111.318 and 431 Milinch of Kairuku Fourmil of Yule Central Province locally known as Yule Island being whole of the land entered in the index of Deed of Attestation in the Department of Lands and Physical Planning. This is to provide a public record of planned actions, decisions, or policies, allowing for scrutiny and feedback.
Following the publication of this gazette, many expressed concerns, accusing the government of land grabbing from customary landowners. Minister Rosso in addressing the issue said that the notice was misunderstood.
“It’s been in the news and social media and like social media in PNG, they like to sensationalize and use it to their own benefits,” Rosso stated. “I have assured the governor specifically in the presence of the secretary that it was not the intention of the Department of Lands to acquire the whole of Yule Island and there is no title given to anyone else in Yule Island.”
“It is a process that Lands does to ensure that declaration of land to see where the church land is, where the government land is and etc.
“It is a process that we need to complete these files with and I have assured the Governor that once that process is complete the land where the Catholic church, or whatever is on which area of the land is identified, the rest is for the village and they utilize it to whatever they want to do with it.
“No one has the title for Yule Island, it is the process of declaration of National Interest, so we can see whoever interested parties are in there and sort out the technical aspects of it. We have advised the governor and we will keep her abreast of what is going on there.”
Central Provincial Member, Rufina Peter, spoke of the land acquisition on Yule Island during the swearing-in of the Central Provincial Physical Planning Board on the 23rd of May, 2025. Although she was satisfied with his clarification of the notice, she requested a proper response from the minister to the people of Yule Island."
PNG facing child well-being crisis,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4649,,Health,Fear,"James Marape, Jason Peter","“Just be very careful, child protection and well-being is not a checklist. You have to act.”
The UN Secretary General’s Special Representative on Violence Against Children, Dr Najat Maalla M’jid, issued this stern warning yesterday during a presentation to the newly established Permanent Parliamentry Committee on Youth and Children on Wednesday, 28 May 2025.
Dr Najat Maalla M’jid’s comments come at the back of alarming statistics, delivered by Danielle Winfrey, Manager of Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment (GEWE) with the National Capital District Commission (NCDC) at this meeting.
She highlighted that the future of Papua New Guinea (PNG) was at stake with alarming child well-being indicators - 47% immunization coverage, 44% child malnutrition, only 13% of births registered, child marriage that see children below the age of 18 marry, 45% access to basic water services and access to basic sanitation at 20% in urban areas, and 15% rural households.
Winfrey also highlighted that 5,310 cases of gender-based violence have been reported in the National Capital District (NCD) since 2017. Of these cases, 696 were cases involving children. The vile acts committed against these children include sexual penetration, sexual assault, sorcery accusation, forced marriage, denial of resources, and trafficking among others. These numbers are for NCD alone, as there is no national data base on child protection.
The government was challenged by Dr Najat Maalla M’jid, the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative on Violence Against Children to invest in Papua New Guinea’s children. According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), three-quarters of PNG children are experiencing some form of violence.
“Today you established this parliamentary committee, that its really important to promote, to monitor, to remind all the policy makers who made commitment that they had to deliver and they have to be accountable.
“I am seeing many things that are not going very well. Just be very careful, child protection and well-being is not a checklist. You have to act.”
During her short visit, Dr Najat met with Prime Minister James Marape, governors, senior ministers, parliamentarians, civil society groups, youth representatives, and members of the justice sector.
The committee was also briefed that the government is taking steps to address the injustices faced by children nationwide but progress is slow.
Minister for Community Development, Youth and Religion Jason Peter said, “We look forward to work with the development partners and other ministerial agencies and we believe that we all can work to together to put our children first in the country.”
Dr Najat says a lot is being done, “But just connect the dot. This is very important, there are many overlapping, you have to really build this chain of services in a concrete way. What type of services are needed, and how people are going to access it.”
Speaking on the newly established committee Dr Najat said, “It’s also about seeing child protection and well being as an investment. Its not additional expenses. Regarding just violence against children, direct and indirect costs is estimated to 11% of national GDP and in some countries its six times higher than the budget allocated to health.”
The establishment of the Permanent Parliamentary Committee on Youth and Children is expected to be a game-changer. The Committee is expected to provide oversight and accountability, coordination and integrity for child-focused policies and budgets, and monitor the Lukautim Pikinini Act, and drive cross-sectoral solutions.
Prime Minister James Marape in his address challenged those responsible for the well-being of children, especially parents to look after their children.
“To our fathers, look after your children, to our councillors, look after your children, to all members look after your children, to our governors look after your children and to myself, under my watch, I commit to look after children of our country,” said Prime Minister Marape.
The consequence of not taking any action will see PNG not achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for children including the aim to leaving no child behind: economic, social, and health costs will escalate; and the loss of potential leaving millions of children unable to contribute to PNG’s growth."
Relief efforts for drought-affected communities,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4642,,Humanitarian,Trust,Nill,"The International Organization for Migration (IOM), in collaboration with the National Disaster Centre and the Bougainville Department of Community Government and District Affairs, has worked through the Bougainville Directorate of Disaster and Emergency to successfully deliver essential relief supplies to remote communities on Nissan Island and the surrounding atolls in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.
Due to the generous funding support from the U.S. Government, this has enabled the prepositioning of relief supplies, a total of 200 Non-Food Item kits including jerry cans, soap, and kitchen utensils were distributed across the islands of Nissan, Pinapel, Fead, Carterets (Han, Piul, Iolosa, Iasela, Iagain), Mortlock, and Tasman. These islands are particularly vulnerable to drought and climate-related disasters.
The distribution focused on reaching the most at-risk households, including those headed by women, persons with disabilities, and the elderly. Approximately 1,000 individuals are expected to benefit from the assistance, which is aimed at enhancing household resilience in the face of environmental challenges.
Felsiha Tsiau, Manager of the Carterets Community Government, expressed appreciation for the support:
“These jerry cans will greatly assist families in Iolosa and Iasela, who often have to travel long distances to fetch water during the dry season.”
Quentin Talingapua, Coordinator of the Bougainville Directorate of Disaster and Emergency, highlighted the importance of the collaborative approach:
“We deeply value our partnership with IOM, especially their technical support in conducting needs assessments and ensuring an effective emergency response.”
As part of the broader response, IOM, supported by U.S. Government funding, provided technical assistance, logistics, and critical relief materials. IOM also deployed staff to Nissan Island and the surrounding atolls to support the Autonomous Bougainville Government’s field operations. Additionally, ongoing climate adaptation assessments are being carried out to identify key vulnerabilities and inform future strategies to strengthen community resilience to climate-related impacts."
Government Keen to Create Attractive Business Environment,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4650,,Business,Anticipation,Richard Maru,"Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru says the National Government is committed to creating a more attractive business environment by investing in in ease-of-doing-business interventions.
Minister Maru made this statement during his keynote address to members of the Government Agencies and the private sector who gathered in Lae, Morobe Province, for the 8th Customs Business Consultative Forum under the theme, “Customs Delivering on its Commitment to Efficiency, Security and Prosperity,” hosted by the PNG Customs Service.
Minister Maru acknowledged that PNG is not an attractive place to do business right now compared to other countries.
“I want to thank all our Government Agencies and our private sector for hanging in there despite all the challenges that we are facing as a country including highest unemployment, highest law-and-order problems, serious foreign currency issues, national debt of over K60 billion, and depreciating Kina value which have made it very difficult especially for our private sector. Our biggest problem in the last 50 years has been this: We have failed to build a strong and robust economy like other countries. After 50 years, PNG’s GDP sits at about US$ 30 billion.”
But not all is doom and gloom. Minister Maru stated, “Because we have seven new resource projects coming up including Papua LNG, Pasca Gas, P’nyang Gas Project, Wafi-Golpu Mine, Frieda Mine, Wildebeest and Namabarope. These resource projects will underpin the economy going forward. To create the 1 million jobs as stipulated in our Medium-Term Development Plan 4, we must change our policies, we must downstream process all our resources, we must compete with the rest of the world to bring in foreign direct investments, and the best way to do it is to develop Special Economic Zones (SEZs) as the main driver of future economy growth. SEZs will be very critical.”
Minister Maru added, “Our over reliance on the mining and petroleum sector has been our biggest mistake since Independence. While we have seven resource projects in the pipeline for the next ten years, this sector will not be our future. Our future will be downstream processing of all our logs and fisheries resources, manufacturing of all our raw materials in country, and replacing imports like rice. This is the future.”
Minister Maru also informed the participants on the review of tariffs and the need to protect the manufacturing sector, and the need to bring in a new anti-dumping legislation to protect the industries from dumping of products from other countries.
“The Government remains committed to fostering a sustainable and diversified economy by reducing dependence on foreign aid, strengthening trade partnerships to create a more competitive business environment, and making PNG an attractive destination for global investors. We are looking at building new trade and investment partnership with Indonesia, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates, and also deepen and strengthen our trade and investment relationship with China and Japan on the back of a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement,” said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru extended an invitation to all participants at the forum to attend the upcoming launch of the PNG SEZ Foundation Policy on June 16, 2025, and the 2nd PNG SEZ Summit that will be hosted at the Hilton Hotel in Port Moresby from August 31 – September 3, 2025."
Over 840 graduate from FODE in Fly,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4644,,Education,Joy,Nill,"More than 840 students across the Fly River region in Western Province have graduated or advanced through the Flexible Open Distance Education (FODE) program—marking one of the largest FODE graduation cohorts ever seen in Papua New Guinea’s most sparsely populated province.
The milestone achievement was made possible through a transformative education initiative funded by the PNG Sustainable Development Program (SDP) and delivered by the Kokoda Track Foundation (KTF), in close partnership with the Western Province Division of Education. The program offers second-chance education opportunities to those who were unable to complete or continue formal schooling, particularly in rural and hard-to-reach areas.
The celebrations held across the province were attended by senior representatives from PNG SDP, KTF, and the Western Provincial Government, including Western Provincial Education Advisor Charlie Buia, SDP Director of Education Dr. Brad Shaw, KTF CEO Dr. Genevieve Nelson, and KTF Head of Education Martha Bentley.
Among the standout graduates is Marilyn Duwaba, a primary school teacher and single mother of three from Kiunga. After completing Grade 12 more than 25 years ago with a GPA below the minimum teaching requirement, Marilyn turned to FODE for a second chance.
Despite her demanding schedule as a full-time teacher and mother, Marilyn committed to the flexible learning model and successfully upgraded her results. In 2024, she not only met the minimum government requirements for teaching but was named Dux of her graduating class.
“I was so excited that my effort had paid off,” Marilyn shared. “With this kind of opportunity in the community, we don't have to stay at the same level. We can continue to advance ourselves, provide better for our families, and contribute to our communities.”
She hopes her story will encourage others to take the leap, despite challenges or past setbacks. “You don't stop because it doesn’t turn out right the first time. If you want to achieve something, keep going. Education doesn’t end at a certain grade.”
This FODE program is part of PNG SDP’s Gutpela Community Strategy 2025–2030, which aims to empower Western Province communities through inclusive and sustainable development. The education arm of the strategy supports long-term partnerships between SDP, KTF, the national FODE system, and the provincial government to provide flexible learning pathways.
Dr. Nelson described the graduation ceremonies as “a powerful reminder of what’s possible when strategic partnerships work in harmony to serve communities.”
With thousands of students now engaged through FODE across the province, the program is creating a pipeline of empowered individuals—many of whom will pursue further education or employment, helping to drive long-term development in Western Province."

Court dismisses Nomane’s application,28/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4636,,Politics,Disgust,James Nomane,"The Supreme Court has dismissed Deputy Opposition leader James Nomane’s application seeking the court's interpretation of parliament’s recent decision to amend section 145 of the constitution regarding the motion of no confidence.
Nomane’s application was filed on April 17th by lawyer Paul Mawa. The substantive matter was heard on Monday, and the decision was handed down today.
The orders sought in the substantive application were;
•	The applicant (Nomane) seeks ad hoc directions pursuant to Section 185 of the Constitution and Order 11 Rule 9 of the Supreme Court Rules for the application to be deemed as appropriate for the purpose of making an application under Order 11 Rule 32 (1) of the rules, and
•	Pursuant to Order 11 Rule 32 (1) of the Rules and Section 155 (4) of the Constitution, an ancillary order be made to clarify the decision and orders of the Supreme Court of 31 March, 2025 that the Constitutional Amendment No 48 (Motions of No Confidence) Law 2025 has no application whatsoever to the Motion of No Confidence in the Prime Minister dated 27 November, 2024 dealt with by Parliament on April 15th, 2025.
However, the application was dismissed on the basis that the application is an abuse of process under Order 13, Rule 16 (1) (a) of the Supreme Court Rules.
Order 13, Rule 16(1)(a) is a legal provision that deals with evidence in civil proceedings. Specifically, it allows a court to take evidence immediately if a witness is about to leave the jurisdiction or there is another sufficient cause to warrant immediate examination. This provision is designed to ensure that evidence is preserved and can be presented to the court in a timely manner, particularly when a witness is not readily available for later examination.
The court ruled that there are many ways by which the issues that the applicant wants clarification on can properly be brought before the Supreme Court. Making a post-judgment application to get the Court to clarify the effect of its final decision, is not one of them. Hence, the court determines that the application is an abuse of process."

After two months of severe shortages, the health centre was resupplied with essential drugs over the weekend — a direct result of community advocacy and leadership action.
Kairuku MP and Energy Minister, Peter Isoaimo, personally delivered the supplies, following a Kairuku District Development Authority (DDA) resolution to urgently address health needs across the electorate.
“We responded to an emergency request from the staff here. Health is a top priority — and we must keep our people healthy,” said Isoaimo during the handover.
For Inauaia’s health staff, the delivery means more than replenishing shelves. “We were turning away patients or giving only what we had,” said Sister Benedette Poisapio. “This is a major relief for us.”
The DDA plans to roll out similar deliveries to other clinics and aid posts in the district in the coming weeks.
For now, families in Mekeo can return to their local clinic with renewed trust — knowing that help has finally arrived."

World Vision solidifies partnership in health,27/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4624,,Health,Trust,Nill,"World Vision PNG continues to be a dedicated partner to Papua New Guinea’s health sector in promoting and supporting vital health care services.
In solidifying this partnership, the National Capital District Provincial Health Authority (NCDPHA) and World Vision PNG have signed a two-year Memorandum of Understanding to support and strengthen the delivery of critical health services, particularly under the Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS programs.

NStJA concerned over misuse of uniform,26/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4602,,Organization,Trust,Nill,"The National St John Ambulance Council (NStJA) is aware of a video circulating on social media showing a man in his 20s wearing a T-shirt bearing National St John branding with a PNG flag on the right breast pocket, and engaging in alleged inappropriate conduct in a public store.
NStJA clarified that the individual shown in the video is not and has never been a member of the PNG National St John Ambulance. The actions portrayed do not reflect the values, behaviour, or standards expected of our organisation or personnel.
It is an offence under Section 13 of the National St John Council Incorporation Act 1976 for any person to wear or use a St John uniform, emblem, badge, or any identifying mark in a way that suggests they are connected to the National St John Ambulance unless they have written permission from the Council.
The law exists to protect the reputation and trust associated with the St John uniform, similar to the legal protections in place for the uniforms of the Police, Fire, and Defence forces.
“The St John uniform is associated with trust and integrity. People welcome St John staff into their homes and businesses at their most vulnerable time. We must protect the uniform, just as it is protected by law for police, fire and defence personnel,” said Dr Mangu Kendino, Chief Doctor, National St John Ambulance.
The public must be able to trust that a person wearing a St John uniform is a trained, authorised, and accountable member of the service.
NStJA is currently progressing a National St John Council Bill through Parliament, which proposes stronger penalties for the unauthorised use or impersonation of St John personnel or uniform.
This will bring the law in line with protections for other emergency services and help us continue to uphold public trust in the service."

North Fly Acting Provincial Police Commander (PPC), Inspector Anjap Minata, said .
Police were searching for the suspect, Koim, who is alleged to be involved in a sexual penetration case involving a minor. During that search, police discovered that the suspect had marijuana.

Minata confirmed that the two drug boxes weighed about 18 kilograms and were worth K90,000 to K100,000 on the street market.
He said the drugs were nicely wrapped with a black wrapper and sent through the Mail Express via Port Moresby from Mt Hagen to Kiunga. He said by the look of it, it was a professionally designed and organized business run by the suspects.
PPC Minata said the suspect, Koim was arrested and charged in 2018 for the same offence. He was imprisoned for two years, but never learned his lesson.
“It is a fast-making money business, and everyone is involved in these illegal activities, but the law will still catch up with you one fine day.
“So, you must stop this illegal activity immediately and get involved in another money-making business, PPC Minata said.

3 cops arrested in shooting death of woman,26/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4605,,Local,Sadness,Nill,"Three police officers have been detained following the shooting death of a young woman at the Waigani market on Sunday, May 25th, 2025.
During a police operation on illegal activities by some vendors in Waigani, a weapon was discharged, and a young woman from Southern Highlands Province was struck with a bullet and died.
In a statement released today, Police Commissioner David Manning said the three police personnel are under a criminal investigation to determine who fired that fatal shot, and the circumstances surrounding the discharge of a firearm.
“I call on all members of the community to remain calm while this matter is investigated,"" Commissioner Manning said.
""As Commissioner, and speaking on behalf of all capable and dedicated police, I expect better and a more restrained use of force from our personnel.
""The public can rest assured that this is not only an internal investigation, but also a criminal investigation.
""The fact of this matter is that a young woman is dead from a gunshot wound.
""From the briefing provided to me, it appears the police officer who discharged the weapon had not intended to shoot this young lady, but that is not the point. A woman is  dead because a gun was fired.""
Following the incident, Commissioner Manning instructed a review of police procedures and the use of warning shots.
""The RPNGC is already introducing 'less-than-lethal' measures to control potentially violent situations, including CS gas and beanbag rounds.
""Just because a police man or woman has a loaded gun does not give them the right to  shoot, as certain conditions must apply at law. There must be an imminent threat to the lives of civilians or security personnel for a firearm to be discharged.
""There will be clearer rules of engagement in confronting threats, with the escalation of force to deal with threats clearly articulated.
""That being said, these changes will not bring back the life of the young lady who has tragically died in this incident.
""On behalf of the RPNGC I offer my most sincere condolences to her family,and a commitment to ensure this matter is fully investigated and ensure justice is served."""

PNG’s Remote Areas Remain Lawless and Unprotected,24/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4588,,Crime,Fear,James Marape,"Professor Bryce Barker of the University of Southern Queensland, who was held captive by criminals in the Bosavi area in 2023, says the recent kidnapping of people along the border of Western and Hela/SHP provinces shows that little to nothing has been done to secure these remote places from thugs and criminals who wonder there at will and terrorise the lives of unsuspecting locals.
Professor Bryce was on a research trip to the Bosavi area in 2023, when he and five other people were kidnapped by criminals, allegedly from Hela Province and held captive in exchange for a ransom.

The Prime Minister, James Marape met the released hostages at the airport back then and told the media that the amount of money paid was less that what the captors had demanded.
""They were released nothing close to a K3.5 million kina as demanded or requested was paid. We've reached a critical stage in the operation where we could not delay any more, they had to come out alive. Engagement was possible, security and lives of the three were at risk, first things first we had to secure them out alive,"" Marape told the media on February 12, 2023.
This was the first recorded case of kidnapping along this area and two years on, another eight people have been captured two weeks ago.
In this latest turn of events, the Police Commissioner confirmed in a statement this week that two criminals were arrested and are now in police custody while the identities of others are known.
Professor Bryce told TVWAN Online that, “while I understand the complex issues that the PNG authorities and the police have to deal with in coming to grips with these issues of lawlessness in these remote parts of PNG – however until there is a concerted effort to control these criminal gangs situations like this will continue. “
“The successful extraction of my team from this situation shows that given the right impetus and resources these gangs can be found and dealt with.”"

“He’s a smart coach, and looking at the results from last year, he has reminded the boys to set goals, stick to the processes, and work hard to be better than last year,” Roltinga said.
With an optimistic outlook, he stated, “We have some good boys this year, and I’m very confident we can make the top six again and go all the way.”

Middle Ramu farmers equipped,23/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4564,,Local,Joy,Nill,"Local rice and coffee farmers in Middle Ramu district in Madang Province have been equipped with rice milling machines and coffee machines, easing labour and transportation hardships.
The Middle Ramu District Development Authority (DDA) handed over 20 rice mills, 40 coffee machines to farmers to continue working to enhance local production. The assistance also included six dinghies with outboard motors and 100 sewing machines for the community.
Member for Middle Ramu, Kansol Kamdaru, as chairman of the Middle Ramu DDA, made the presentation in Madang on Wednesday, May 21.
“We are about to celebrate our 50 years of independence and due to our remoteness, lack of transport infrastructure, geographic locations and economic challenges, I deliver this much-needed equipment,” stated Kamdaru.
He said the district is able to produce various cash crops cultivated in the Highlands; however, for over 40 years, it has been very expensive for his people to transport from the point of origin to various market locations.
“We have spent millions of kina in transport costs alone, which could have been saved for classrooms, teachers' houses, health services and other needs,” Kamdaru added.
The Middle Ramu’s National Census conducted in 2023 has recorded its population density to be over 116,600. The DDA is updating data for rice and coffee farmers and mothers in each local level government area.
“We travel long distances just to mill our rice and coffee and after paying our transport and machine costs, we are left with minimal revenue that does not reflect the hard work put into production and sales of our cash crops,” Kamdaru added.
Meanwhile, the missing road link between Madang and Mul-Baiyer is under construction, which can alleviate transport issues for the people of Middle Ramu."
Bilum Couture Hits Runway,23/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4566,,Culture,Joy,Nill,"Papua New Guinean designer and cultural advocate Florence Jaukae Kamel will headline PNG Fashion Week 2025 and represent the country at Fiji Fashion Week in Suva, marking a historic double appearance for the renowned ""Bilum Meri.""
Announced on May 18, Kamel steps in for William Maba Bray, who is unable to attend Fiji’s event due to personal reasons.

As founder of Jaukae Bilum Products, Kamel also empowers rural women through artisan work. “Bilum is more than fashion—it’s identity, it’s womanhood, and it’s power,” she said.
Her upcoming showcases promise to elevate PNG’s creative legacy with purpose and pride."
Road restores life for remote villages,23/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4573,,Development,Joy,Nill,"After nearly a decade of isolation, five remote villages in West Sepik Province are reconnected to the outside world—thanks to the EU-STREIT PNG Programme for the construction of a 16.7 km road.
For over 10 years, more than 12,000 residents endured risky sea travel to reach Vanimo, the provincial capital. Now, with the newly restored road linking Rawo to Leitre and neighboring villages, the journey has become safer, cheaper, and faster.
“This road is a very big plus for the rural community,” said Father Joseph Runnai from Leitre’s Catholic Mission. “Before, travelling by sea was expensive and dangerous.”
Since June 2024, the International Labour Organization (ILO) under the EU-STREIT PNG Programme constructed 22 culverts, two bridges, and climate-resilient infrastructure to ensure year-round access.
The impact has been immediate—transport costs have dropped from PGK 100 to PGK 20 per cocoa delivery, rekindling interest in cocoa farming and increasing local cash flow.
At the heart of this revival is the Saint Mary’s Cocoa Growers Group, which produce 467 kg of dried beans in a month, earning over PGK 6,400. Youths are distributing pest-tolerant seedlings, women are selling more produce in markets, and previously unreachable vanilla and fish farmers are gaining access to buyers.
Even mobility has improved, with motorcycles now common in Leitre. For young mother Raynatalyn Simewa, who has a hearing impairment, the road brought her first job and dignity. She now earns PGK 700 a month doing road maintenance.
Backed by the European Union’s Global Gateway Strategy, the road exemplifies how sustainable infrastructure can reshape rural lives—creating jobs, empowering women, and opening global market access.
“All we wanted was a road,” said farmer Penuel Amele. “And now we can take off from here.”"

Department of Personnel Management Secretary Taise Sansan said this agreement builds upon the foundation laid by previous agreements, and reinforces DPM’s shared commitment to improving the terms and conditions of employment of nurses and recognizing the invaluable contributions of our nurses.
“Let us not forget the fundamental truth: nurses are the heart and soul of healthcare in Papua New Guinea. You are the frontline warriors, the compassionate caregivers, the silent advocates, and the unwavering pillars of strength for our communities. From bustling urban hospitals to remote rural clinics, you tirelessly dedicate yourselves to providing crucial medical services, often under challenging circumstances.
“Today’s signing of the MOA signifies the current government's unwavering commitment to recognizing and supporting the essential services provided by our nurses. In a landscape where healthcare accessibility and quality are paramount, this agreement is a critical step towards strengthening the very backbone of our healthcare system,” said Sansan.
Secretary Sansan expressed her deepest gratitude to all the nurses of Papua New Guinea.
“Your dedication, professionalism, and unwavering commitment to service are an inspiration to us all. You are the bedrock of our healthcare system, and your contributions are essential to the well-being and progress of our nation. As we move forward with this MoA 2025-2027, let us embrace the opportunities it presents to strengthen our profession, improve our working conditions, and enhance the quality of care we provide to the people of Papua New Guinea,” Sansan concluded.
The implementation of this new Agreement will be a collective effort of all respective stakeholders including all the PHAs around the country."

Dr Najat Maalla M’jid, the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence Against Children, will arrive in Port Moresby on Sunday 25 May for a five-day mission.
This is her first official visit to PNG, and it comes as the country steps up its role as a Pathfinder under the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children (EVAC), which it joined in 2021.
In November last year, PNG participated in the Global Conference on EVAC in Bogotá, Colombia, where it presented its national pledge outlining key commitments to child protection reform.
Dr M’jid is expected to meet with Prime Minister James Marape, governors, senior ministers, parliamentarians, civil society groups, youth representatives, and members of the justice sector.
UNICEF PNG Representative Dr Veera Mendonca said the visit came at a critical time, with nearly three-quarters of children in the country experiencing some form of violence.
“Violence against children is widespread, devastating, and preventable,” Dr Mendonca said.
“No child should have to grow up in fear,” she said.
Dr Mendonca said the mission was expected to help mobilise support for EVAC implementation, increase investment in child protection services and the social service workforce, expand positive parenting programs, and improve coordination across sectors.
“Home to millions of children, PNG is one of the youngest countries on the planet,” she said.
“As we approach 50 years of independence, UNICEF stands ready to help the Government seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to leverage its huge demographic dividend.”
The mission will also include consultations with young people, civil society actors, faith -based organisations, and frontline child protection practitioners."

Hearing on concerns surrounding elections,22/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4563,,Politics,Anticipation,"Allan Bird, Keith Iduhu, Puka Temu","Illegal firearms and ammunition, timely access to operational funds and coordination concerns regarding intelligence sharing between the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) and the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) were highlighted during a public hearing conducted by the Special Parliamentary Committee on the 2022 General Elections, today.
The one-day public hearing held at the Parliament’s State Function Room was conducted to follow up on key recommendations from its report on the RPNGC, PNGDF and the PNG Electoral Commission. This is in preparation for the upcoming by-elections and the Local Level Government (LLG) elections, and more significantly, the 2027 National General Elections.
Conducted by Chairman Allan Bird, Deputy Chairman Sir Puka Temu and Committee Member Keith Iduhu, questions were posed to representatives from the PNGDF, Department of Defence and RPNGC.
The committee sought to establish how much of the recommendations from the Committee’s Interim Report on the 2022 General Elections were being embraced by each organization to improve their preparedness in upcoming elections.
Chief of PNGDF, Rear Admiral Philip Polewara says the PNGDF is preparing for worst case scenarios.
In regards to questions surrounding the sharing of intelligence, Polewara said, “On the ground, yes, there is regular daily exchange of information between the two forces because we support the police. But at this level, between me and the commissioner, we talk about the operations. But the nitty-gritties of it, we haven’t discussed since my time in the office.”
In response to questions on illegal firearms and ammunition circulation in the Highlands region, RPNGC Chief of Staff Kyle Saltmarsh said he believes the use of firearms is best tackled by two mechanism; the first is by cutting off the source of funding that enables the purchase of ammunition, the transfer of elicit firearms; and more effective collaboration and more effective targeting.
Furthermore, in responding to questions posed surrounding timely availability of essential operational funds, Defence Secretary John Akipe said the department is preparing to submit their budget that includes election preparation costs this year for the 2026 budget. Chairman Bird and Deputy Chair Sir Puka says this may be too late and the budget should have been submitted last year for release this year.
Emphasizing the significance of the hearing, Chairman Bird emphasized the importance of managing public perception.
“I’m very aware and sensitive to public perception and one of the things I think this Committee should get from all of you is to (is) a lot of these concerns will have been dealt with so the public will have confidence.”
Meanwhile, Deputy Chairman Sir Puka impressed on the PNGDF and the RPNGC develop a ‘security strategy for 2027.’ He further stated that the PNGEC needs to also, develop a 2027 election plan so key stakeholders like security partners can be able to plan around these key dates and activities endorsed by the commission."

He also made a call to third parties to stay out of this situation and let police do their job to free the hostages in a lawful matter.
“We are aware of some intelligence which indicates efforts by political elements to attempt ransom negotiation with the kidnappers.  I reiterate that such conduct will not be tolerated and risks the effectiveness of ongoing police operations,” he concluded."

Japan tells PNG to sort trade issues,21/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4544,,Business,Anticipation,"James Marape, Richard Maru","As Papua New Guinea’s second largest trading partner, Japan is calling on the PNG Government to address significant lingering trade issues that hinder Japanese business, investment, and tourism in PNG.

Saito said Japanese businesses and tourists were keen to visit, to do business and invest in PNG, however, PNG has let itself down by not sorting out trade issues that have been talked about for a long time.
The four critical issues that Saito raised were:
1.Visa on Arrival for Japanese standard passport holders. This arrangement existed prior to COVID. However, since COVID, the arrangement was temporarily halted and is yet to be lifted by PNG immigration and Citizenship Authority.
2.The need for Air Niugini to resume direct flights from Port Moresby to Narita, Tokyo, for ease of connectivity.
3.Remittance of foreign currency. The foreign exchange and regulations by the Bank of Papua New Guinea is not giving priority to the repatriation of dividends that delay the remittance of profits back to Japan.

PPCs call for review of Bail Act,21/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4536,,Law,Concern,Nill,"Provincial police commanders (PPCs) have called for a review of the Police Bail Act due to the increase in bench warrants delivered by the courts for execution annually.
The PPCs in a conference on Monday said they receive more than 50 bench warrants or court orders issued by the judge because defendants fail to appear in court after being granted bail.
Western Highlands Provincial Police Commander, Superintendent John Sagom, raised this issue during the one-day Prosecution Review Committee workshop for provincial commanders in Port Moresby. He stated that more than 400 bench warrants in his office need to be executed.
He said most of those who do not appear in court are those out on police bail and fail to appear in court.
PPC Sagom was supported by other PPCs, calling for a review of the Bail Act and amend the part that grant everyone the right to bail. They added that this right has allowed people to bail out and leave the area where they committed the crime, migrating to another location and making it difficult for the police to locate them and bring them to court.
The PPC’s also recommended that if a person is apprehended for any offense and wants to bail, they must obtain a guarantee letter from either their councilors or family leader and present it to the bail officer for the detainee to be released on bail.
Director of Prosecution, acting Superintendent Pare Kuiap, challenged the PPCs to work closely with all the prosecutors and investigators in their respective provinces to ensure they secure more convictions."
Upset vendors call for answers,21/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4543,,Business,Anger,Nill,"Vendors at Waigani Market in the nation’s capital are seeking answers from the National Capital District Commission following the loss of their market goods through fire on Sunday night.
They want NCDC to explain the delay in the redevelopment of the Waigani market.
In 2023, the Waigani market was closed after NCDC announced the redevelopment, forcing market vendors to operate in the open space under temporary shelters.
They believe their market goods would not have been burned if they were still using the old market. Vendors confirmed that toilets were built; however, a two-year delay in constructing the main market.
Since then, vendors have been using the open space beside the Waigani police station and Kone Tigers oval.
“NCDC told us to go home for three months, and we listened. We felt that life got hard. We started to market outside with the agreement with the boys living here and the Police. We have been here for two years and six months. We want to return to the main market,” said Margareth, a market vendor.
Another vendor, Joyce said; “All our cargo bags with fresh goods like banana, kaukau, cabbage, carrot, onion, and kumu bags, the money that was spent on them, worth K2000 to K3000 and some we got the bags on credit have all been lost.”
Currently, police investigations are underway.
Meanwhile, Governor Parkop, in sympathizing with the vendors of Waigani Market, said NCDC will not make its position known until a police report is received after investigations.
He said that at this stage, NCDC will not accept liability for this act as it was not related to the delay in the rehabilitation and expansion of the existing Waigani market.
Parkop said this problem was caused by criminals and not NCDC."
Waigani incident under investigation,21/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4542,,Local,Fear,Nill,"Police in NCD and Central province are hard at work to ensure the murder and arson incident at Waigani in the early hours of Monday does not escalate to other parts of the city and Central province.
The NCD/Central Commander, acting Assistant Commissioner of Police, Benjamin Turi confirmed that police officers from NCD and Central have been tasked to monitor the command and ensure that nothing like this happens again.
He said investigators are doing their job to first identify the deceased, obtain statements from possible eyewitnesses, and create a file that will guide them in further investigations.
Turi said the report is sketchy because the Engans and the Goilala's who are involved, are yet to come forward to provide statements on what happened that led to the death and destruction of the market.
He said there are many social media posts on the incident, which are misleading, and the police are working to verify facts and provide proper updates to the public.
Turi said Central police are patrolling their areas of operation. He confirmed that there are no roadblocks along the Hiritano Highway, contrary to social media posts. While in the city, police units are monitoring possible locations where they think either group may meet to cause trouble related to the Waigani incident.
Turi said it is an unfortunate situation that has caused many people to suffer, as vendors have lost their food to sell inside the market, and the people who buy from Waigani market now have to travel to other locations to do their marketing.
“I want to assure the public that the situation at Waigani is under control, and my police officers, along with other support units, are hard at work to ensure the city is safe. My call now to the city residents is to respect each other. Port Moresby City is Papua New Guinea, and it is not a village where people move around in ethnic groups to harm others and cause trouble in the city. Many people are moving into the city every day, making policing a challenge for us daily,” Turi said.
He added that the number of unemployed people in the city has increased, which has led to criminal activities. He said police have limited powers to control the movement of these people coming into the city.
“I do not want my police officers to correct these unemployed people and get blamed for correcting them, because most of them do not know the basic laws on how to respect others who are living in the city.”
“Awareness after awareness is made, but people do not listen; that is why we see people losing their lives and properties. The incident that started at Waigani involved unemployed people asking a security guard for money, and when they received a negative response, they attacked him, which led to the destruction of properties and lives lost,” Turi said.
He commended police officers for their efforts to quickly respond, carry out investigation, and make their presence known in their command."

•Public Awareness Campaigns: Ongoing education and outreach initiatives schedule post implementation will inform consumers and businesses of their rights and obligations.
Any business or retailer found to:
•Continue charging GST on zero-rated items, or
•Retain pre-zero-rating prices without passing savings on to consumers, will face penalties under the GST Act 2003 and related legislation. These include fines between K1,000 to K50,000, loss of GST input credits, deregistration, and potential prosecution.
Businesses are further advised that:
•Only goods acquired or imported after 1 January 2025 and held in stock by 1 June 2025 qualify for zero-rating.
•Notwithstanding the above condition, Input tax credits will only be allowed where it can be proven that the benefits of zero-rating were passed on to the final consumer.
Furthermore, as outlined in the IRC's high-level report to the Government, this initiative is expected to reduce household expenses and support low-income earners by making essential goods more affordable.
While it is projected to reduce GST revenue by K210 to K300 million over the six-month period this year, the long-term socio-economic benefits in terms of inflation control and improved access to basic goods are substantial.
IRC, ICCC and Customs are collectively calling upon all businesses to act in good faith and uphold their social responsibility by implementing this policy transparently and fully. The success of this initiative depends on cooperation across all sectors of the supply chain, from importers and wholesalers to retailers.
“We urge consumers to be vigilant. If you notice any business failing to comply, you are encouraged to report the matter to the IRC, ICCC, or PNG Customs through the contact details below. Together, we can deliver real savings for our people.”"

Madang Provincial Police Commander Acting Superintendent Robert Baim confirmed that the Manager for Yaho Supermarket, the manager for Supreme Investment Cooperative Service and one other Chinese national were each charged with one count of grievous bodily harm and one count of deprivation of liberty.
He said the three were allowed a K12, 000 police bail and will appear in court when their court documents are ready. This now brings the total number of arrests to six.

According to police, security and shop employees accused mother and daughter of stealing items inside the shop.
PPC Baim said, “The guards and the employees then escorted the mother and daughter to the shop’s storage area and started unlawfully assaulting them. After assaulting them, they took the mother to the police station and detained her (and allowed) the daughter to go home. After the mother was detained, the police officers requested that both parties provide their statements. During the investigation, a video went viral of what had happened at Yaho.”
“I then instructed my officers to obtain statements from the mother, the child, the guards and to have those responsible arrested and charged.”
He said on May 13, two male shop employees who were alleged to have been involved in the assault were arrested. The following day, another individual was picked up and charged."

Morobe schools want principals dismissed,20/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4516,,Education,Anger,Nill,"Three secondary schools in Morobe Province have been calling for the dismissal of their respective principals.
The schools are Bumayong Lutheran Secondary School in Lae, Grace Memorial Secondary School in Wau and Dregerhafen Secondary School in Finschhafen.
School fighting has been constantly disrupting classes at Bumayong and Dregerhafen, where countless students and members of the community have been injured since the beginning of the 2025 academic year.
The fighting is not exclusive to this year only. Bumayong and Dregerhafen have come under the spotlight in previous years for the constant fights that have led to very low academic performances from them every year.
On the other hand, Wau-Waria district’s only secondary school; Grace Memorial, have petitioned for the removal of their principal due to mismanagement, negligence and abuse of school assets.
Currently, a teacher and her children are living in the dormitory due to no accommodation, with students and staff claiming that the principal, Oting Zuhuke, has repeatedly refused to hold dialogue with them.
The Morobe Provincial Education Board (PEB) is aware of these matters and has indicated that they will be visiting the respective schools this week to assess the situation.
“It is within the powers of the PEB to appoint and dismiss principals,” this newsroom was told.
“The PEB will need to look at the root cause of these issues; where it started from, who caused it, and so on. Nobody else can do this except the PEB; not even our school inspectors or district education managers.
“The PEB is authorised by law to make these decisions.”"
Financial literacy for schools achieved,20/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4526,,Education,Trust,Nill,"Financial Literacy Education (FLE) will soon be implemented in schools throughout the country after the conclusion of a two-week Financial Education Curriculum Validation workshop, culminating in the delivery of 40 fully aligned educational resources.
The Centre for Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI), in partnership with the Department of Education (DoE) through its Curriculum Development Division (CDD), successfully concluded the workshop. This marks an important step in the implementation of the Financial Education in Schools PNG (FESPNG) Project.
The workshop, held from May 15th–16th, also brought in an external partner from Aflatoun International and Cufa to review and align 13 syllabuses, 13 Teacher Resource Books, and 13 Student Activity Books.
This thorough process resulted in the development of eight strands, 16 units, 16 content standards, and benchmarks, reinforcing a consistent and inclusive approach to financial literacy education across all grade levels.
The workshop will support the integration of FLE into the country’s Standards-Based Curriculum from preparatory to Grade 12, and to validate the financial education curriculum materials developed through collaboration between the DoE-CDD, CEFI, Aflatoun International and Cufa.
The objectives of the workshop are to ensure that the financial education content aligns with CEFI’s Financial Literacy Standards and Conceptual Framework, maintaining national relevance and consistency. It also aimed to evaluate the developmental appropriateness of concepts across all grade levels, promoting coherent and age-appropriate progression.
Expert input was sought from financial literacy technical advisors to enhance the accuracy and contextual suitability of the content. Additionally, feedback from CEFI and external partners was gathered to confirm the curriculum’s relevance to real-life financial challenges. Finally, the workshop validated the templates of the Teacher Resource Books and Student Activity Books to ensure they are well-structured, accessible, and practical for classroom use.
Aflatoun Asia’s regional coordinator, Ya Ling Chao, who was present at the workshop, commended the country’s dedication to integrating financial education.
Chao described the initiative as “a historic milestone” and one of the most proactive collaborations she has encountered in the region.
On Friday, 16 May 2025, George Awap, Assistant Governor – Financial System Development and Innovation Group- Bank of Papua New Guinea, gave an impactful message at the end of the Financial Education Curriculum Alignment Workshop.
Awap thanked CEFI & DoE-CDD for their hard work during the two-week workshop. He praised their teamwork and also remembered past leaders who helped bring financial education to life.
“We are building on the hard work of those who came before us,” he said, naming former CEFI executive director Saliya Ranasinghe for his early efforts.
Awap’s key message was about Financial Education becoming a national focus.
“It should not only teach people how money works but also help them change their thinking and use this knowledge in real life.”
He said making a financial education curriculum is not easy. It must meet the needs of many different people and communities. There are challenges and these include reaching remote schools, finding enough money, and helping people, especially adults, change their way of thinking about money.
“It’s not just about lessons. It’s about changing habits.”
Awap explained that financial education is now a national priority and is part of the government’s wider plans. He encouraged Papua New Guineans to trust the financial system, and for students to use what they learn in real life.
“It’s about giving the students the right knowledge and knowledge that empowers them both inside and outside the classroom,” he said.
Steven Tandale, First Assistant Secretary at the DoE’s-CDD, praised the dedication and collaborative spirit of the workshop participants.
He emphaized the critical role that writing, research, and continuous improvement play in curriculum development and encouraged educators to view challenges as opportunities brought for innovation.
Tandale also acknowledged the practical barriers to implementation, such as logistics, printing, and delivery to remote schools, but affirmed that the team’s resourcefulness had led to creative solutions, including improved communication methods and enhanced documentation strategies.
The FE curriculum is critical in empowering students with essential financial knowledge, practical skills, and value-based learning, fostering lifelong learning, financial resilience, and responsible citizenship.
In total, 40 educational documents have been produced across the three workshops (two similar workshops held in 2024), all of which were funded by CEFI and delivered in collaboration with the DoE. This outstanding effort marks a national commitment to embedding financial literacy across all stages of formal education in Papua New Guinea."

Upgrades to ATW road unveiled,20/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4522,,Defence,Trust,Nill,"Deputy Chief of the Australian Air Force, Air Vice Marshal Harvey Reynolds and PNGDF Chief of Force Preparation Colonel Craig Solomon have officially opened the upgraded Access Road to the Air Transport Wing (ATW).
The upgrade of the Jackson Access Road was delivered through the Defence Cooperation Program (DCP), Australia’s longstanding defence partnership program with PNG.
The project was delivered with a local Papua New Guinean construction contractor. The original unsealed road severely restricted vehicle movement, making access to the ATW difficult and dangerous. The upgrade included the replacement of the unsealed road with a more resilient, sealed asphalt road.
To enhance community safety and security, a footpath alongside the access road has been installed. The footpath provides much safer access to those travelling to the area on foot, including to the medical centres. Road lighting and road signage have been included to further improve safety and security.
A major element of the upgrade was addressing the longstanding drainage issues on the road which previously caused flash flooding, rapid road deterioration and diminished road usability. The upgrade included the installation of refurbished drainage systems.
“We are thankful to the ADF for coming through the DCP to refurbish the access road. This is just a small part of the partnership program we (PNGDF) have with the ADF,” Chief of Force Preparation Colonel Craig Solomon said.
“Through the dedication of the ATW, the PNGDF Air Element is an incredible capability, and the ADF is proud to be a part of its journey,” said Deputy Chief of Air Force, Air Vice Marshal Harvey Reynolds.
Australia and Papua New Guinea share a close and longstanding defence partnership built on cooperation and trust. The upgrade to the access road will support the PNGDF to deliver on PNG government priorities."

The deal will include additional contingent payments of up to about PGK89 million (A$35 million and US$22 million).

Ok Tedi Chairman Mark Stone described the acquisition as a “significant step” in the company’s evolution into a multi-mine business, highlighting the government’s support for long-term sector growth.
“Papua New Guinea is a mineral-rich land with many natural assets just waiting to be unlocked, and the Misima mine, with its 3.8Moz resource together with potential exploration upside, is a great example of that,” Mr Stone said. “We hope that bringing Ok Tedi’s strong operational capability to another national resource will contribute to the Government’s Vision 2050.”
Managing Director and chief executive officer, Kedi Ilimbit, echoed this optimism, stating the company is entering an “exciting period of expansion” under its Growth 2050 vision.
“We have many great projects on the horizon… the reopening of Misima gold is just one early step in the journey,” Mr Ilimbit said. He also emphasised Ok Tedi’s proven track record in community consultation and its plans to ensure benefits from the project flow directly to local communities on Misima Island.

"Moses , King named in Yeo-led Blues team for Origin I",19/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4498,,Sports,Anticipation,Nill,"Isaah Yeo will captain the Westpac NSW Blues in Origin I, while Mitchell Moses has won the five-eighth spot and prop Max King was named for his representative debut.
Laurie Daley has named his first Blues side since returning to the coaching role this season and has stuck closely to the team which won last year's series for the Origin opener at Suncorp Stadium on May 28.
Yeo takes over the captaincy from Jake Trbojevic, who was unavailable after suffering a head knock in Townsville on Saturday night, and will start at lock in place of the injured Cameron Murray after being on the bench last season.
Moses edged out his 2024 Origin II and III halves partner Jarome Luai to play alongside superstar playmaker Nathan Cleary.
However, the biggest selection surprise was King, 28, on the bench for his Origin debut - joining his grandfather Johnny King, an NRL Hall of Fame inductee, as a NSW representative.
Dylan Edwards retains the fullback jersey ahead of James Tedesco, while Daley has shown faith in wingers Brian To'o and Zac Lomax, who have both played one match since returning from injury.
As a result, there was no room for Sea Eagles star Tom Trbojevic.
Latrell Mitchell and Stephen Crichton are the centres, as they were in last year's emphatic Origin II win at the MCG, while Cleary returns after missing the second and third match of the 2024 series through injury.
Moses was his replacement, and he will now play alongside the superstar playmaker at five-eighth.
The forward pack of Yeo at lock, second-rowers Liam Martin and Angus Crichton, props Payne Haas and Mitchell Barnett, and hooker Reece Robson all played in Origin III as NSW regained the Shield.
Interchange prop Spencer Leniu and utility Connor Watson were also members of the winning Blues side, while second-rower Hudson Young returns after being dropped for the series decider.
Murray, Trbojevic and Bradman Best were all unavailable from the team that played in Origin III at Suncorp Stadium, while Luai was overlooked.
With injury concerns over Haas (quad) and Stephen Crichton (groin), Daley has named forwards Stefano Utoikamanu and  Haumole Olakau’atu and centre Campbell Graham in an extended 20-man squad.
The Maroons team will be announced on Monday morning, but Canterbury officials have confirmed that veteran utility Kurt Mann, who plays as a middle forward for the Bulldogs, would be the club's second Origin debutant.

Hospital Connects Through Innovation,19/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4504,,Health,Anticipation,Nill,"The Paradise Private Hospital (PPH) executive team, including Director of Finance and Administration Janet Sios is part of a global gathering of over 800 senior health leaders exploring how technology can improve patient care, access, and outcomes.
Themed “Transforming Health Care through Connection,” the event focuses on digital innovation—from artificial intelligence and mobile apps to wearables and telehealth—as tools to save lives and improve quality of life.
“Our goal is simple: to provide more effective, affordable, and equitable care for our people back home,” Mrs. Sios said. “By investing in digital health, we’re putting patients at the center of a smarter, more connected healthcare system.”
Mrs. Sios shared that these innovations are not just about machines or software—they're about people.
“Technology helps doctors and nurses spend more time with patients and less time on paperwork. It allows rural families to access specialist care remotely. It’s about using tools to bring care closer to those who need it most.”
PPH is currently rolling out a Digital Hospital Management System aimed at streamlining operations and ensuring patients receive timely and accurate treatment.
According to Sios, artificial intelligence will soon reshape how clinicians diagnose, monitor, and treat illness—helping them focus more on healing than managing data.
The Digital Health Festival also provides an opportunity for PPH leaders to meet with service providers, listen to experts, and discuss real-life challenges and solutions in global health.
“Human connection is still at the heart of everything,” said Sios. “Technology must work with compassion to truly make a difference.”

Its launch under the 2024 MOU has allowed the program to expand into schools nationwide, with support from government and corporate partners. Marianville is among the first schools to complete a full cycle of the program.
As these young graduates step forward with new confidence and purpose, today’s event stands as a beacon of the kind of change that starts in classrooms."
The “Night Angels” Unisocial Program,19/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4508,,Local,Sadness,Nill,"Night Angels Unisocial event, another charity programme supported by the Universal Church, brings Hope to Port Moresby's homeless on the weekend at night.
The Universal Church recently activated its ""Night Angel"" initiative, a program dedicated to reaching out to and supporting those on the streets during the night.
Teams from the Universal Church ventured out into Port Moresby, specifically visiting the 4 Mile and 3 Mile areas. It was a moving experience for the team members to meet and hear directly from people living on the streets about the circumstances that led to their homelessness.
Many individuals shared heartbreaking stories of their daily struggles for survival. They spoke of the challenge to find food, sometimes going days without eating. Some explained they ended up on the streets due to mistreatment from their families.
One striking story was of an entire family who had been homeless for 28 years, surviving by collecting cans, selling small items at markets, or depending on the compassion of strangers for food.
Those living on the streets described life as ""restless and sleepless.""
During the day, they wander, searching for something to eat or a way to earn a little money. At night, they return to their usual sleeping spots, often only to be disturbed or chased away just as they try to rest. They emphasized the constant struggle and pain to survive on the streets of Port Moresby.
In response, the Universal Church's Night Angel team provided practical help in the form of food. Importantly, they also shared words of faith and encouragement, assuring individuals that with God's help, their situations can change.
They extended an invitation, challenging people to use their faith and come to the House of God, believing they will be blessed and can transform their past hardships into future testimonies.

The PRK Gulf Isou recorded just their second win of the season after beating Gas Resources Central Dabaris 26-14 in Port Moresby.
Coming off a winless season last year, the Isou kept faith in the same playing group for this season. This has seen them put in improved performance in the opening months of the season.
Their experience from last year was evident in their discipline, resilience, and commitment to stay in the context for the entire match, and it showed in the game today.
Isou led at halftime 14-8 and came back strongly in the second half to seal the win in a skillful and defensive display.
Isou coach, Roger Laka praised his side for the game effort they put in to claim another two competition points. He said this win would give them enough motivation for the upcoming matches.
Laka is committed to making sure they string together a couple more wins, something they haven't done in a while.
Dabaris, on the other hand, came off a resounding victory last weekend against NPL Enga Mioks but couldn't maintain their winning ways against the Isou. This is a reality check for Solomon Kuluniasi's men.
Isou will host Bintangor Goroka Lahanis in Port Moresby next weekend in a bid to claim their third win.

Water filter donation improves access to clean water,18/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4494,,Health,Trust,Nill,"According to a 2021 report by UNICEF, Papua New Guinea, with an estimated population of 8.5 million people, is among the countries with the least access to a clean and safe water supply in the world.
Having less access to clean water can lead to water and sanitation-related diseases, which UNICEF highlights as one of the leading causes of death for children under the age of five in PNG.
In a significant step towards improving public health and access to clean water, O.M Holdings Limited (Oilmin) donated a number of portable water filtration bucket systems to Wareho 2 village, located in Kimu along the Bamu river. This impactful donation demonstrates a strong commitment to the well-being of the community and sustainable development in the rural areas of PNG.
The Sawyer International Water Filter is essential due to its ability to remove 99.9 per cent of Bacteria, Protozoa, Cysts, and Microplastics, making water clean and safe for people to drink. This system is particularly vital to rural areas like Wareho 2 village, where access to clean water may be limited.
This system works with a water filter to remove all harmful bacteria, protozoa, and cysts from the water source using a gravity water flow, requiring no electricity and arduous maintenance, which is ideal for people in villages.
The kit includes:
1.	Filter
2.	Use and Care Instructions Sticker
3.	Drill Bit
4.	Backwashing Device
5.	Filter Hanger
6.	Hose and Adapters.
This system can be attached to any standard bucket and act as a simple yet powerful water purifier.

Locals trained to support PHA Combat TB in Central Province,17/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4488,,Health,Trust,Nill,"Papua New Guinea has one of the highest prevalence rates of tuberculosis (TB) in the world – second in the Western Pacific region – with 30,000 new cases reported every year.
The estimated TB incidence in Papua New Guinea in 2016 was 432 cases per 100 000 population.
TB is caused by airborne bacteria affecting the lungs. It’s one of the oldest known diseases in the world and is also preventable and curable. The symptoms include coughing – sometimes with blood, chest pains, weakness, weight loss, fever and night sweats.
TB requires lengthy and complicated medical care therefore in 2008, the PNG National Department of Health (NDoH) initiated and introduced the directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS).
DOTS is the World Health Organization-approved approach to treating TB, bringing the necessary medical facilities and education to communities where it’s needed most. NDoH recognized that there was a need for DOTS as a control strategy due to the very high rates of ‘loss to follow up rate (LTFU refers to TB patients that do not complete their full course of) in PNG.
With support from The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria grant in PNG, the Central Provincial Health Authority (CPHA) through its partner World Vision PNG (who are supporting some areas of implementation of its TB program) co-facilitated a Village Health Assistants (VHAs) training held on Friday 2nd May at the City Boutique Hotel in Port Moresby.
During the one-day training, 14 Village Health Assistants (VHAs) selected from various facilities in Central Province were brought together to learn new skills to support the work of the CPHA to combat the TB burden in the province.
Guided by the National Guidelines on Community TB Prevention and Care, VHAs will support with:
Active TB case finding activities, sputum collection and transportation, treatment supervision, support and monitoring (treatment support and adherence), health education and counseling, advocacy, awareness raising, community engagement and mobilization, provide community TB preventive treatment, support delivery of TB/HIV services, attend trainings/meetings with CPHA as scheduled, meet with clinical staff in the BMU/health facilities on a weekly basis and submit monthly reports and records of the patients under their care.
The training was aimed at equipping the VHAs with the necessary knowledge, skills, and tools to support CPHA provide adherence support to patients such as DOTS, promote infection control practices and enhance case finding through screening and referral of contacts, facilitate community engagement and education activities around TB whilst also providing refreshers around compliance and safeguarding policies on patient care.
Following the training, one VHA, Rei Waena mentioned that he felt more confident in delivering tasks when out in the community and was now able to safely identify safeguarding violations because he understands compliance and safeguarding policies better.
Another VHA, Egona John from Kwikila Health Centre remarked that the refresher was good for the newly engaged VHAs and also for him because it reiterated and reinforced their respective responsibilities as VHAs and how they too have a duty of care in their respective roles in their communities.
During her closing remarks at the end of the VHA training, World Visions Provincial Support Supervisor, Evans Ereman, thanked participants for their time and acknowledged The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria program for supporting the training and work of the Central Province Health Authority, National Department of Health and Government of PNG in the fight against TB."

Two new LLGs for Nipa,16/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4476,,Politics,Anticipation,Billy Joseph,"Upper Nipa and Nipa Urban Local Level Governments (LLGs) have been split from the Nipa Basin Local Level Government in the Nipa-Kutubu District of Southern Highlands Province.
Local MP and Minister for Defence, Dr Billy Joseph, Nipa Basin LLG president John Titus and 39 councilors in a recent ceremony in Nipa, released the new newly established LLGs for the 2025 Local Level Government elections.
The reasons behind the split are primarily due to administrative and governance challenges related to population size, geographic area, and service delivery.
There have been longstanding issues of lawlessness, poor development, and poor government service delivery in the area, which fueled the need for better administrative structures.
The split aims to improve government service delivery and development coordination in line with national policy goals like Vision 2050.
The factors led to calls by local leaders and members of parliament to split Nipa Basin and create new LLGs such as Upper Nipa and Nipa Urban for more effective governance and service delivery.
Dr Billy thanked the councilors for their service at the wards level for which they are paid like any other public servants and reminded them of the important role they play in governance and leadership.
He urged them and those aspiring candidates to run their campaigns peacefully without threats or intimidation and wished them all the best in the upcoming council elections."

SHPH allocated two million kina in the 2025 budget for university subsidies and has released that allocation to universities across the country.
Governor Powi in presenting the cheque noted that there is a lot to do, but his government is doing its best to ensure parents are assisted.
“We want to announce to the people of Southern Highlands that the provincial government is not just doing nothing. We are partnering with the parents and students to ensure that they are supported in this manner.
“We are doing what we can. The needs are very big of which I wish I had all the resources to support all the different institutions but this is the best we can do. We are trialing it out. I expect the students to not take these things for granted but appreciate it and make the best out of it as the Southern Highlands Provincial Government is equally investing in your future,” Powi said.
Another three million kina has been allocated to assist SHP students at Parul University in India. That funding will be presented later in the year when the executives of Parul University visit the country.
SHP provincial Administrator, David Kelma in thanking the provincial government for taking this bold step to assist students also announced the continuation of this program in the years ahead.
“The provincial government will continue this scheme of supporting students going forward. We are not just going to stop here. Governor Powi is adamant, he wants to support, he understands the importance of supporting our Human Resource. The only set back we had in past years was the issues in the province that put a lot of challenge on us so that’s why we did not continue the program. But going forward, starting this year onwards, the provincial government and the administration is supportive of the students attending universities.”
Representing not just the UPNG Southern Highlands students but all university students benefiting from this scheme, President of the UPNG Southern Highlands Students Association, Justice Moya welcomed the subsidy and thanked the provincial government for recognizing the SHP students studying in the universities around the country."
SPA undergoing reviews,16/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4466,,Government,Trust,Nill,"The Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs (DPLLGA) has conducted a comprehensive review of the Special Purpose Authority (SPA) to evaluate its effectiveness as a service delivery mechanism for Local Level Governments (LLGs).
The review identified systemic challenges, operational inefficiencies, and opportunities to strengthen SPA’s role in decentralizing service delivery.
Deputy Secretary of DPLLGA Larson Thomas announced this during the swearing-in of new board members of the Southeast Mananda Special Purpose Authority on Tuesday in Port Moresby.
This review focused on assessing the operational and institutional effectiveness of the Service Providers Association (SPA) in its role as a service delivery mechanism for Local Level Governments (LLGs).
Mr Thomas said a report from this review recommended certain policy and legislative reforms to be made to enable DPLGA as the regulator of SPAs to manage the affairs of SPAs.
Main policy and legislative reforms done so far include:
-A model SPA Constitution is now being developed and will be used as a Standardized Constitution for all SPAs to adopt once it is approved by Minister;
-Amendments to section 45 and 50 of LLG Administration Act has been made to ensure accountability and prudent management of public funds allocated for service delivery to SPAs.
Mr Thomas explained that the amendment of section 45 of the Local Level Government Act has been amended to remove and ban Chairman and the Board members of the LLG SPAs from being signatories to bank accounts.
He further clarified that section 50 is amended to include specific powers for Minister responsible to take punitive actions against Chairman, Board and Management of SPA if deemed abusing office."
Local derby looms in Round 6,16/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4477,,Sports,Anticipation,Nill,"Round 6 of the Digicel Exxon Mobil Cup is set to showcase some highly anticipated battles as teams intensify their efforts and focus on their game strategies. The action will kick off on Saturday at three locations: Rabaul, Kimbe, and Minj, leading into an exciting lineup of matches on Sunday.
For rugby league fans in Port Moresby, an intriguing matchup is on the horizon between neighbors Gas Resources Central Dabaris and PRK Gulf Isou at the Santos National Football Stadium on Sunday. This clash will be preceded by the Central Dabaris U19 team taking on the Mt. Hagen Eagles U19 in Round 1 of the inaugural National Youth Competition at 1 PM.
Meanwhile Dabaris are looking to build on their commendable performance against the Enga Mioks last week. However, they won’t underestimate the young and talented Gulf Isou side, who are currently playing with increased confidence, energy, and improved structure in their set plays. After recording their first win in Round 1 against the Kimbe Cutters, the Roger Laka-coached team has faced a few narrow losses against marquee teams in the competition, including a close match against Waghi Tumbe, where they lost 18-20 last week in Minj. This indicates that a win is within reach, thus Dabaris will need to be wary of the challenge that awaits them on Sunday.
A bumper crowd is anticipated at the Lae Rugby League Field for the top-of-the-table clash on Sunday, featuring first-placed Lae Snax Tigers against second-placed PRK Mendi Muruks.
Meanwhile, Bintangor Goroka Lahanis will be eager to bounce back when they host Enga Mioks at the National Sports Institute. This main match will be preceded by a National Youth Competition Round 1 clash between Lahanis U19 and Lae Tigers U19.
On Saturday, the iconic Queens Park in Rabaul is expected to be packed to capacity as foundation clubs and longtime rivals, East New Britain Gurias and Moni Plus NCDC Port Moresby Vipers, face off. The Gurias will be looking to make amends for their loss against the Muruks last week.
Meanwhile, across the border in West New Britain, the Peter Humphreys Oval in Kimbe will be buzzing as the Kimbe Cutters host Hela Wigmen. Still searching for their first win after five rounds, the Cutters showed glimpses of their potential last week, giving the Port Moresby Vipers a tough challenge before falling short in the final minutes. They will look to leverage their home-ground advantage for a strong performance against the Wigmen.
The local rivalry continues in Minj as the struggling 2024 premiers, Mt. Hagen Eagles, face off against Asila Waghi Tumbe on Saturday."
Independence Retirees study commissioned,16/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4471,,Social,Sadness,Nill,"The commissioning of a study into old retirees of both private and public services who commenced work around the Papua New Guinea independence era (16th September 1975), took place at the Bible Translation Association Hall on Tuesday May 13, 2025.
Andy Bawa, a private entrepreneur sponsored the study to take place in the National Capital District. Bawa said with celebrations brewing for PNG’s 50 years of Independence, it is only fitting for these particular sectors of the population to be recognized.
He said he wanted all elderly retirees to be interviewed to establish if they have problems, or needs and wants that they would like to bring up.
The four-week survey will be carried out by an organization called Mado Wain Association Inc. Bawa said the association has sound local knowledge of geographical and community settings in Port Moresby and has cost effective methods to carry out this work. Some 200 youths from 12 Ward areas are on stand-by to assist with this survey.
“By 21st July 2025 the findings of the study would be made known,” Bawa said.
In representing the retiree officers, Nick Klapat expressed appreciation on the study while he revealed struggles and suffering endured by retirees like himself.
Kiap recalled that in his capacity as a kiap or patrol officer 50 years ago, he climbed mountains to unite people and prepare for independence in September 1975.
He said some of the people left employment without their full entitlements, while others got their entitlements but had the customary obligation to share among the family members, so their final entitlement was depleted in less than a year and it remains so to this day.
Gong Ned Kabug, Program Director of Mado Wain Association Inc, assured Mr Bawa that he would be collaborating with Congregation Chairman of different churches in Motu Koitabu villages to carry out the study."
Call for proper investigation into plane crash,15/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4455,,Accident,Sadness,Nill,"Former NCD/Central Assistant Commissioner of Police, Anthony Wagambie Jnr is calling for proper investigations into the fatal plane crash that took the lives of five Papua New Guineans in Morobe Province last December.
Wagambie Jnr said this during the funeral service of his brother, late Senior Constable Napolean Wagambie, one of the passengers who died in the plane crash.
He said the outcome of the investigations will ensure that proper processes and procedures are followed to avoid such incidents from happening in the future.
“We must pursue this to ensure a proper investigation takes place, an aircraft investigation, and a coroner's inquest must take place, and we must find out what happened.
“We police officers get deployed to rural areas when there is an operation, and the only means of transport is through small aircraft. Therefore, we call for a proper investigation to ensure that other police officers or civilians will not go through this experience.
“I never want any other family to go through the experience we have gone through. It is one of the worst experiences when you don’t have answers, no witnesses, you are helpless, you cannot drive out to the crash site. We were waiting and hoping that those sent there would bring us good answers. However, the reality has unfolded and there is nothing much we can do but live on with his memories,” Wagambie Jnr added.

Treasury Secretary, Andrew Oaeke, said K512,994.03 has been transferred to the Morobe Provincial Administration for economic item 252220 (teacher salary grant) under appropriation level 11122 (Morobe Provincial Government).
“Please be advised that the payments will be made by Department of Education, through the payroll, to the retired teachers’ personal bank account,” Oaeke outlined in a letter to PA Bruten.
This is in line with the announcement from Teaching Service Commission that final entitlements and repatriations worth K9.9 million will be paid to 291 retirees on pay number 10, Wednesday, May 14th, 2025.
This is only for teachers who have retired, not resigned."
Retired teachers await Governor Wenge,15/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4453,,Government,Sadness,Luther Wenge,"Retired teachers in Morobe Province, who are now in their 60s and 70s, have been sitting at Tutumang Haus all week to follow up on Governor Luther Wenge’s commitment.
The teachers, who have retired as early as 2015, are awaiting a K2 million repatriation funding that was promised by Governor Wenge in 2023.
Governor Wenge had announced in one of his forums at Tutumang that the provincial government will support retirees’ repatriation back to their home provinces, aside from the commitment made to support pastors, widows, people with disability and the elderly; promises that are yet to be kept.
Newaidaya Stoesel, from Goodenough Island in Milne Bay Province, graduated in 1981 from Balob Teachers College, came to Morobe from Misima in 1987, and taught until her retirement in 2023.
Married to a man from Finschhafen, where she spent most of her teaching years at, Stoesel outlined that the governor advised them that discretionary funds will be used to repatriate them.
“When the governor found out that teachers who were retired, were stranded, he got up and spoke in the month of October 2023 that he’s prepared to meet this repatriation,” she said. “And we were very happy. He cried and we all cried too. That was the first cry we made with him.
“And we really dropped tears, believing, trusting that the next minute, we will get that money and we will go home,” she explained in typical Milne Bay English, surrounded by her peers.
“Unfortunately, we waited, and waited, and waited and we are still waiting because there are a lot of commitments in the province. We cannot deny it. It’s a big province. But governor still told us that he will make sure that he meets the retired teachers’ fees to go home.
“It was very encouraging to us and we are patient.”
Sakale Popen, who hails from Manus, started teaching in Eastern Highlands Province in 1977. He taught there for 22 years then moved to Manus in 1998, stayed there for a year-and-a-half before becoming a school inspector in West New Britain Province.
From there, he came to Morobe and started teaching at Lababia in Salamaua, before moving to Lanakapi, Bumayong, Tent City’s St. Patrick's Catholic Primary School, St. Martin’s Catholic Primary School then to Markham Road primary. He eventually retired on January 25th, 2021.
“Since 2021 to 2025, we have been waiting for our repatriation entitlements,” he shared. At this stage, we are getting closer to receiving our entitlements; hopefully this week or next week.
“There are more than 100 retired teachers because it goes back to 2015 to 2023. Now some of them have retired in 2024 and 2025 and are waiting for their entitlements.”
The retirees had petitioned the provincial government in 2024 to send them home, with governor Wenge saying the provincial executive council has allocated K2 million for the exercise in the 2025 budget.
It is estimated that K3.5 million will be needed to repatriate the 219 retirees and while waiting, they have lost some of their counterparts through the years."
Children at risk as poliovirus confirmed,15/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4454,,Health,Fear,Nill,"UNICEF is stepping up its support to the PNG Government to ensure every child is vaccinated following the detection of poliovirus.
The detection has triggered a national emergency response to protect children across the country, supported by UNICEF and partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Australian Government.
UNICEF will support the Government to strengthen surveillance, procure and deliver vaccines, prepare for two rounds of nationwide polio vaccination. It will also assist provincial health authorities to engage communities, raise awareness, and encourage parents and caregivers to vaccinate their children.
UNICEF Papua New Guinea Representative, Dr Veera Mendonca said while there’s no cure for polio, the disease can easily be prevented by ensuring every child is immunised.
“This is why UNICEF is working with the Government of Papua New Guinea and other partners to stop the virus in its tracks and ensure all children are protected,” she said.
Highlighting the important role of churches, Dr Mendonca said UNICEF is actively working with church and community leaders to reach every family and protect every child. “We need their voices to promote accurate information and encourage vaccination,” she said.
Dr Mendonca added that UNICEF is working closely with national task forces on resource mobilisation, communication, and outbreak control.
“Technical specialists in immunisation, cold chain, advocacy, and social behaviour change are already deployed at national and provincial levels, including Morobe and the National Capital District,” she said.
“We call on community leaders, churches, media outlets, and other organisations to help share accurate facts and dispel any rumours or misinformation,” she added.
Dr Mendonca noted that Papua New Guinea had been declared polio-free for 25 years, yet low routine immunisation coverage has left many children vulnerable.
“While the focus right now is on stopping this outbreak, we must take this opportunity to boost routine immunisation to 90 per cent and protect children long-term,” Dr Mendonca said.
UNICEF joins the National Department of Health (NDOH), WHO, the Australian Government and other partners in urging all parents and caregivers to bring their children for vaccination, check immunisation cards, and report any signs of illness.
“Together, we can stop this outbreak and keep Papua New Guinea polio-free — for our children, for our families, and for our communities,” Dr Mendonca said."
Church wins court battle over 2022 eviction,15/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4457,,Legal,Trust,Nill,"The National Court at Waigani has awarded over K4 million in damages when it ruled in favour of Morata One Seventh-Day Adventist Church and 22 other Block Holders of Morata One, against Sixth Estate Limited company and the State.
The case is in relation to an eviction that was carried out at the Morata One suburb in the National Capital District between October 12 and 14, 2022.
The National Court, presided by Justice John Carey, handed down the decision on April 17, 2025, in favour of the SDA Church and the 22 other Block Holders of Morata 1, and awarded them damages of over K4 million, covering loss of church buildings, block holders’ properties, breach of constitutional rights, and costs.
After carrying out investigations of their own, the aggrieved residents, including the church, found the October 2022 eviction to be illegal and improper. They engaged a lawyer, Silas Kaule of Kaule Legal and filed court proceedings against the police and the company that ordered this eviction, Sixth Estate Limited.
The plaintiffs claimed in the proceedings that the company and the Police conducted an eviction on settlers residing on a piece of land owned by Sixth Estate Limited, identified as Portion 2733 Morata. However, during the eviction, they encroached and trespassed onto a nearby land portion occupied by the SDA church and 22 other Block Holders.
The nearby land occupied by the SDA church and the other 22 Block Holders was way outside the boundary of Portion 2733. It was alleged, amongst other things, that the company’s action was illegal in that it did not have title to the land occupied by the SDA Church. Furthermore, there was no court order authorizing the eviction of residents on the land occupied by the SDA church."

Stop Media Suppression,15/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4458,,Politics,Anger,"Allan Bird, James Marape","The Media Council of Papua New Guinea has called on the government of the day to address the two termination cases of media personnel by first cracking down on the board and management that they had worked under.
The Council highlighted the cases of former TV reporter James Guken, and FM100 Talkback Show host, Culligan Tanda.
Guken says he was terminated without notice after writing an online news article quoting the Parliamentary Opposition. Tanda was initially suspended for three weeks without pay following a NASFUND FM100 Talkback Show programme which featured the Governor of East Sepik Allan Bird following the last Vote of No Confidence motion in parliament. Subsequently, Tanda was issued a termination notice upon the completion of his suspension period Wednesday this week.
Yesterday Prime Minister James Marape told this newsroom that he has advised his Chief of Staff to find out from the FM100 management what its reasons are for Tanda’s termination and if they can state them publicly for the nation to hear.
The Council also reminded the managements of State-owned media organisations, that Section 5 of the Organic Law on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (OLICAC) includes within the definition of corrupt conduct by public officials, the dishonest exercising and abusing of official functions.
The Council has called on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) to investigate the matter for corrupt conduct and establish if processes were abused when panelising both Tanda and Guken for their reporting.
“A free, robust, and independent media is an essential pillar of democracy,” stated Media Council President Neville Choi. “It is the cornerstone of allowing freedom of speech, and freedom of expression.”"
Call for joint action,15/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4464,,Health,Anticipation,Nill,"A call for action and joint coordination was made regarding the Joint WaSH Sector Program Implementation and Monitoring Committee (JWSPIMC).
This committee was launched yesterday together with the UMBEN Platform. These launches were to renew a collective ambition to deliver safe water, sanitation, and hygiene for every Papua New Guinean.
National WaSH Programs Coordinator, Takale Tuna, shared that a powerful management information system, which is the UMBEN platform, is only as effective as the coordination that supports it.
“DNPM is also launching the JWSPIMC, a strategic Coordination mechanism to ensure government and development partners are aligned, complementary, and accountable to our National Development Goals and the WaSH Policy 2015–2030.
“This coordination mechanism is a key initiative under the MTDP IV, designed to improve coordination and reporting on WaSH progress against key targets.”
The Committee will report to the Departmental Heads & Agency Committee (DAC) and ensure strong cross-sector leadership and accountability. The DNPM WaSH PMU will serve as the Secretariat.
Department of National Planning and Monitoring Secretary, Koney Samuel, emphasized the platform’s over 134 accredited users across the four regions, which require alignment and call for joint action.
The committee aims to: Increase rural water access from 48 per cent to 70 per cent by 2027, improve rural sanitation from 33 per cent to 60 per cent, and achieve 100 per cent clean water access in urban areas by 2027."
New system to improve WaSH progam,14/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4443,,Development,Trust,Nill,"The lack of reliable data has long been a barrier to Papua New Guinea’s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH) program. Impacting decision making and investment.
To improve this, the WaSH Program Management System was upgraded and launched today.
With the new system in place the Department of National Planning & Monitoring (DNPM), through its WaSH Program Management Unit will equip the people of the country with real-time data to inform planning and resource allocation, transparency, coordination and accountability across all levels of government in the WaSH space.
DNPM, with the assistance of the Australian Government, invested K1.5 million to upgrade the system and rollout across the country.
“This platform has now evolved into a more dynamic, user-friendly and customized platform, renamed the UMBEN Platform. The UMBEN platform, meaning fishing net in English, is inspired by the image of a net cast into the sea, capturing everything in its part in the same way.
“The spirit of this initiative is a shift towards more effective, coordinated and inclusive service delivery throughout the country. UMBEN is not just a technical upgrade. It's a game changer for how we plan, deliver and monitor our services across Papua New Guinea,” National WaSH Programs Coordinator, Takale Tuna.
The platform will give updates on thematic dashboards, maps, monitors and reports on WaSH sectors across the country. Since the launch of the system in 2017, data has been collected across 31 districts, including 3095 rural communities, 1,577 schools and 416 health care facilities.
“One statistic that stands out in particular for me and for the Australian Government is around households spending one to two hours a day, on average, due to basic wash services and accessing water, collecting water time that could be spent in employment or education, or spending time with family,” Tuna said.
“Projects like this, which bring together data so that we can use it for planning and coordination, will hopefully increase that access, reducing the time spent by families and communities in doing things like collecting water.
“This particular burden is also felt more by women, meaning a lack of wash is a critical barrier to women's empowerment and gender equality. All partners believe strongly that resiliency, resilient wash services are the foundation to increase individual, household, and community resilience and help us all improve livelihoods, security and reduce poverty.”"

Vipers groom young talent,14/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4442,,Sports,Anticipation,Nill,"The Port Moresby Vipers kicked off the 2025 Digicel ExxonMobil Cup season with victories, looking ahead to a promising competition, with emphasis now on youth development.
Club chief executive officer, Ronnie Titie has provided an insight into the club’s vision, he emphasised the importance of integrating young players into the team.
“While it’s a work in progress, the latest statistics show promising signs,” he stated. The youthful Vipers are beginning to embrace the elite level of competition with newfound confidence.
As a foundation club in the national rugby league, the Vipers have struggled since their last premiership title in 2013. Titie noted that the club is undergoing a comprehensive overhaul of its systems, including coaching, player selection, and scouting of younger talents who can add value for the long term.
""This year, we’ve made changes to our playing group and coaching staff. We have two rookie coaches, Wellington Albert and Brandon Gotuno, who bring fresh perspectives to the team.
“Most of our players are drawn from the PRL and our Vipers Academy, along with talent from the Governors Cup and suburban leagues. This year’s squad is a good mix, with only two senior players—our captain and vice-captain, Gilmor Paul and Fedro Gene.”
Titie highlighted the effort put into fostering team cohesion. “We’ve worked hard to get the boys to gel, and so far, we’ve achieved four wins and one draw. It’s been a long time since we had that winning spirit. We recognize there’s always room for improvement.”
The squad features promising young talent, Manesah Watt from Bavaroko Junior High and Benard Lai from Gerehu Secondary, alongside university students.
Titie expressed excitement about the next generation of players, including sons of PRL legends Joseph Nipal and Robert Akunai, who are ready to carve out their legacies.
“Eddie Nipal, coming from rugby union, is adapting to league, while Norman Akunai has shown great resilience after recovering from surgery. They’re following in their fathers’ footsteps and have brought significant energy to the team,” he added.
To provide leadership on the field, co-captains Gilmor Paul and Fedro Gene have been instrumental in guiding the young squad. “They lead by example and foster a sense of unity among the players. We tell them to play for each other, their families, the club, and the people of NCD. We aim to restore the city’s pride and relive the glory days.”
With a renewed focus on youth and a clear vision for the future, the Port Moresby Vipers are positioning themselves as a formidable force in a couple of years."
Feeder road rehabilitation brings new hope to South Wiru coffee farmers,14/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4439,,Development,Anticipation,Nill,"A vital feeder road linking coffee-growing communities from Kamborini to Wala in the South Wiru LLG of Ialibu Pangia District of Southern Highlands is under rehabilitation.
The road works is under the Papua New Guinea Agriculture Commercialization and Diversification (PACD) Project, supported by the World Bank and the Government of Papua New Guinea.
Speaking at the project site, PACD Coffee manager, Potaisa Hombunaka emphasised that the 5.5km road upgrade is more than just a transport improvement—it is an economic lifeline that will unlock opportunities for thousands of coffee farmers.
“This is not free money from the World Bank or the Government,” Hombunaka told the gathering of local leaders, farmers, and stakeholders.
“This is a loan project, and it is critical that we use this support responsibly to ensure our coffee can reach the market, and the returns from coffee flow back into our communities.”
The road, identified as a priority under the Coffee Component of the PACD Project and implemented by the Coffee Industry Corporation Ltd (CICL), is being supervised by the Coffee Project Management Unit.
Local company Bushdog Construction Limited has been contracted to carry out the works.
Hombunaka explained that the rehabilitation of the Kamborini-Wala road is expected to directly benefit between 3,000 to 4,000 coffee households in the area, potentially increasing annual production from the current 78,000 parchment coffee bags to over 100,000 bags.
“This road is a pathway for our people to connect to markets, earn better incomes, and improve their lives,” Mr Hombunaka said.
“Projects like this are about transforming rural livelihoods, empowering farmers, and connecting isolated communities to the broader economy.”
He acknowledged the historical challenges faced under previous programs such as the PPAP Project but said the PACD is now building on those lessons, ensuring projects are delivered with greater efficiency and accountability.
“This road is a symbol of hope for South Wiru,” Mr Hombunaka stressed.
“We thank the World Bank and the Government for this partnership, and we urge our people to take ownership, protect this infrastructure, and use it to grow their coffee industry.”"

BCFW Forum discuss employment conditions,14/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4423,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"Business Coalition For Women/ (BCFW), in collaboration with the EU’s Investment Climate Report /(ICR) Facility, organized an Informative Breakfast for stakeholders in Port Moresby yesterday 13th May 2025
With the theme, “Advancing Inclusive Labour Policies: a Path to Gender Equality in Employment and Business Growth in PNG,” the forum seeks to address the urgent need for reform in Papua New Guinea’s Employment Act, focusing on the introduction of adequate paid maternity leave, the incorporation of paid paternity leave and the elimination of discriminatory clauses that restrict women’s full participation in the workforce.
The Information Breakfast was a combined effort of the BCFW and the Inclusive Labour Reform (ICR). The ICR Facility is currently supporting BCFW in effectively engaging with policymakers and lawmakers to develop gender-sensitive business environment reforms with a particular focus on revising Chapter 373 of the Employment Act 1978.
“We are here to discuss the removal of discriminatory provisions in the Employment Act. We want to see maternity leave included up to 14 weeks. We want to see the removal of discriminatory provisions of dismissal of pregnant mothers who’d been employed for less than 90 days. So today has culminated after several research reports identifying that we do need to focus on care policy provisions and specific inclusions in the Employment Act 1978 to ensure it is up to date,” Kennedy explained.
Elizabeth Asigau, Manager, Survivor Advocacy & Support Services, informed the forum on some of BSP’s responses for its workforce across all its markets, in terms of Gender Equality and Social Inclusiveness.
“One of the links identified is that economic dependence can increase the vulnerability. Many of the victims or we’ll use the term interchangeably, or survivors, rely very heavily financially on the abuser or the abusive partner,” Asigau said.
Kennedy said BCFW was supported by the LCR last year, they employed two key pieces of research: one was employees’ supported childcare, and the other was the labour market survey they did nationwide with over 2000 participants, both men and women from all regions.
“Within the research, it identified there were some significant barriers for both men and women, either in entering the workforce or being retained in the workforce. We had to start focusing on ‘Care Policy Provisions' and start focusing on …so we know when we’re looking at these legislative reforms, we need to be considerate of safeguarding as well,” said Kennedy"
Winners of Homemade Ideas,14/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4430,,Local,Joy,Nill,"From survival to innovation, three local entrepreneurs are using creativity and compassion to change lives through Papua New Guinea’s 2025 Search for Best Homemade Product.
Their stories aren’t just about business — they’re about healing, sustainability, and hope.
Three extraordinary Papua New Guineans have turned personal battles and everyday challenges into powerful products that are now national award-winners.
In the just-announced results of the 2025 Lily Homemade Product Competition, Carole Cholai, Geno Geno, and Nicholar Boas were named winners in the wearable, useful, and edible categories, respectively — each product deeply rooted in PNG’s materials, and even more so in its humanity.
For breast cancer survivor Carole Cholai, necessity became innovation. After undergoing surgery last year, she created a one-sided mastectomy bra that provides comfort and dignity to women on the same journey.
“I thought I was going to die,” Carole said through tears. Now, through her Sista Luv Foundation, she is giving back, offering post-surgery care kits and emotional support to fellow survivors.
In Lae, agronomist Nicholar Boas is tackling lifestyle diseases with a vivid twist — a vibrant blue herbal salt made from butterfly pea flowers. Her product, rich in antioxidants, helps regulate blood pressure and blood sugar. With support from CPL Group, Nicholar’s salt may soon appear on supermarket shelves.
In Port Moresby, Geno Geno is turning waste into wealth. A previous winner, she returns with a mulch made from discarded betelnut husks — a product that not only helps plants thrive but also creates income for unemployed youth and supports environmental clean-up in the capital.
Out of 150 entries, the three were chosen by a panel of 11 judges. They now receive cash prizes, business support packages, mentoring, and national exposure. All finalists, including seven flown in from around PNG, participated in a business workshop funded by the PNGAus Partnership, backed by MiBank and Women’s MicroBank.
Each story is an incredible testament to the power of purpose. Whether healing scars, protecting the planet, or preserving health, these entrepreneurs are proving that PNG’s future can be homemade and heartmade.
The overall winner of the competition will be announced in the next edition of Lily Magazine, with additional prizes up for grabs. But for now, these three innovators are already champions — not just in business, but in spirit."

Polio detected in Lae,13/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4412,,Health,Fear,Elias Kapavore,"Poliovirus has been detected in Lae Morobe Province through an environmental analysis of wastewater.
The Department of Health emphasizes they are aware of the public reports regarding the detection of poliovirus and states that there are no clinical cases.
Health Minister Elias Kapavore, supported by newly appointed Acting Health Secretary Dr Ken Wai and National Department of Health’s (NDOH) executive manager of Strategic Division, Dr Daoni Esorom, in a press conference today, announced the detection.
Minister Kapavore announced that he will be presenting a submission to the National Executive Council (NEC) and advising the Prime Minister on this detection brought to the department’s attention by the World Health Organization (WHO) from environmental samples they collected. He said NDOH is working closely with WHO and DFAT to address this matter.
The detection of the poliovirus is attributed to the severely low immunization coverage across the country, with Minister Kapavore stating that WHO standards require 90 per cent coverage, while PNG’s coverage is approximately below 50 percent.
He said, “That is a serious concern to us as a department. With the coverage of less than 50 percent, (it) is a risk to our people, (it) is a risk to our country.”
The Minister highlighted that Lae and Madang provinces have a low immunization coverage of approximately 30 percent.
Dr Ken stated that vaccinations are important for children under five years old, emphasizing, “We are not running out of vaccines. The government is providing those vaccines free of charge. It is the right of every child to be vaccinated. Mothers and fathers have a responsibility to take every child to the clinics.”
Meanwhile, Dr Daoni Esorom provided further clarity, stating that although the virus has been detected, “There are no clinical cases as yet.”
He added, “The reasons why we are highlighting this is because of our low immunization coverage, our vaccinable population of 0-5 are at risk. Before we have a widespread outbreak, we need to come in and intervene to encourage mothers, fathers, caregivers to come in and vaccinate your child. That’s the only way to prevent polio.
“The complications of polio can be severe, can be lifelong, but it also leads to disability and paralysis. Sometimes kids will eventually die, and the only prevention for polio and to control polio is through immunization.
NDOH is reassuring the public that the situation is being carefully assessed in close collaboration with NDOH partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and the Australian Government.
“Our immediate priority is to review all available information, strengthen surveillance and ensure that any necessary public health measures are prepared and ready to be implemented. The department is committed to keeping the public informed and will share further updates through official government channels as soon as more information becomes available. In the meantime, we ask everyone to rely on official sources for accurate updates and avoid the spread of unverified information.”
Dr Esorom says the poliovirus detected is identified as ‘Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Type 2 (cVDPV2).
Although PNG was officially declared free of wild poliovirus in 2000, along with the rest of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Western Pacific Region, in June 2018, the country experienced a resurgence of polio due to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1), marking the first outbreak in 18 years.
This outbreak prompted immediate response measures, including nationwide vaccination campaigns and enhanced surveillance efforts. By the end of 2018, over 3 million children had been vaccinated, and the outbreak was declared under control.
As of now, PNG remains classified as ""no longer infected but vulnerable to re-infection"" under the International Health Regulations. This status underscores the ongoing need for vigilance and immunization efforts to prevent future outbreaks."

Prime Minister James Marape took the stage and announced that the decision to change Dr. Osborne Liko from his current position was not a disciplinary action nor a decision made with malice, but rather it was for a greater calling.
Dr. Liko has been given the role of special advisor on health to the Prime Minister and the government. He will be giving advice on several important policies that have been formulated during his tenure as the health secretary.
PM Marape said Dr. Liko is a one-of-a-kind in his specialist knowledge, skills and talents and this must be preserved and passed on to the younger generation and into the future so he has to be relieved from stressful duties as the secretary of a sluggish department.
In addressing Dr. Liko and his family support, Prime Minister Marape said he was a wonderful role model, which was reflected by the turnout at his farewell event.
Marape applauded Dr. Liko’s attitude of gracefully accepting the NEC decision not to renew his tenure as the Secretary for Health, without any resistance and urged the younger generation of leaders to develop such attitudes in their leadership pursuits.
“I want to say to all of you, a wonderful example to many of you Papua New Guineans, who are aspiring for leadership at all levels, that when one chapter of your life closes you must have the humility and grace …to move onto another sector at our nation’s 50th anniversary coming up Dr. Liko has shown to all of us that when it’s time to move on, you move on and country first must come in.”
“I want to confess that he is moving on, not because he has performed poorly, but rather because of his exceptional. For me as someone who has great respect for him, I don’t go to any other handover-takeover unnecessarily, I go when it matters most,” said Marape.
“He is our country’s best nephrologist, he is one of our country’s best urologists. I need him to be alive in the next 20 years in our country.”"

Flooding forces suspension of classes,12/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4392,,Education,Fear,Luther Wenge,"Flooding at the Zifasing Junior High School, in Morobe’s Huon Gulf district, has forced the indefinite suspension of classes.
The learning of 439 students has been affected following heavy rains and the subsequent flooding of the school area.
Principal Raj Paskal told this newsroom that while classes have been suspended, depending on the weather, their 183 Grade 10 students will have to return on Thursday, May 15th, to start preparing themselves for their Written Expression examination on Thursday, June 5th.
Principal Paskal and the board of governors have written to Morobe’s provincial program advisor, Keith Tangui, expressing concern for the recurring problem that has damaged school infrastructure and severely affected the safety and wellbeing of students and teachers.
Paskal said from 2022-2024, they have witnessed numerous instances of flooding, especially when the notorious Rumu River overflows.
“Last year, Governor Luther Wenge and provincial administrator, Max Bruten, were on ground during a school event and saw for themselves the damages caused by flooding,” said Paskal.
“There, the governor promised to build a brick wall to prevent the floodwaters from inundating the school. However, the provincial government is yet to honour its commitment.
“The buildings of early childhood, primary and high school have water damages to the walls, ceilings, furniture, textbooks and school equipment.
“Dirty floodwaters are in classrooms and have covered access roads, rendering them unusable.”
The board is calling on the provincial and district government to support them by building flood resistant infrastructure, implement an effective disaster management system and reroute Rumu River, to ensure it flows directly under the Zifasing bridge."
Two arrested in Madang supermarket assault,12/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4397,,Law,Anger,Nill,"Two prime suspects have been arrested and detained at the Jomba Police Station in Madang for assaulting a mother and her 13-year-old daughter at a Madang supermarket for allegedly shoplifting last Saturday.
The video of the mother and daughter being beaten by security personnel went viral, sparking national outrage. The Police department was tagged and called for swift justice, which aided law enforcement in tracking down the suspects and their location.
The arrests of the suspects were made at Laiwaden Oval earlier today. The victim, Josephine Kadignam, 45, verified that the assault occurred inside the Yaho Supermarket warehouse.
Madang Provincial Police Commander, Chief Inspector Robert Baim, in a public update, said the shop had been located and the identified persons of interest were being pursued. Officers are now preparing formal investigations.
Formal charges of assault occasioning bodily harm and unlawful detention have been laid under PNG’s Criminal Code.
PPC Baim said investigations are ongoing and pledged to release a comprehensive media brief once further progress is made. A press conference will be held on Tuesday, May 13th, to further elaborate on the handing down of charges and possibly a court proceeding date.
Issue on the ground is tense as talks of protests unravel, police is on high alert to counter opportunists.
“We wish to inform the public that police have already identified the shop and the individuals involved. However, investigations must follow all legal procedures before arrests are made. This is to ensure that the case can proceed successfully before the courts. If proper legal processes are not met, we risk losing the case due to technicalities.
“The video is a key piece of evidence, but it must be supported by eyewitness statements to give it full legal strength. Therefore, we are appealing to anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward and provide a formal statement. Your cooperation is important in helping us secure justice,” PPC Baim expressed.
Furthermore, PPC Baim asks the public to remain calm and allow police to do their job. Stating that public interference or misinformation on social media does not help, and may compromise the case."

Mr Stolz concluded his anniversary remarks by saying that coming to Papua New Guinea in 1965 was the best decision of his life — a decision, he said, that changed him for the better and deepened his respect for the resilience and warmth of the PNG people.
“Mr Stolz’s words touched us all. His humility, wisdom, and enduring love for our people are gifts that we cherish,” said Prime Minister Marape. “We are proud to honour him today and celebrate the institution he helped to build.”"
Minister Maru Demands Immediate Review of Import Tariffs,10/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4367,,Business,Anger,Richard Maru,"Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru is calling for an immediate review of import tariffs to give protection to local industries who are struggling to compete against cheap and dumped imports.
Minister Maru expressed dissatisfaction with the current way tariff policy is being administered, which he described as being done “unilaterally, discriminatorily and arbitrarily.”
The Minister explained that the Tariff Reduction Program (TRP) was an externally imposed condition under the broader structural adjustment program, which began in 1999.
“The tariff reduction program was agreed to be implemented with the view to encourage economic efficiency and boost productivity. Lowering tariffs was also seen as a way to encourage a competitive private sector by gradually exposing them to foreign competition. Under the tariff review program, almost 80 percent of import tariffs have been liberalized with protective rates being progressively reduced.”
Minister Maru queried the economic benefits promised under the tariff reduction program.
“Papua New Guinea’s economic structure remains largely unchanged since the implementation of the program. Local manufacturing accounts for only 3 to 6% of GDP with the country continuing to be heavily dependent on exports of raw commodities and imports of goods and services that can be locally produced and manufacturing companies have remained stagnant over the years with not much growth.”
Minister Maru explained that some countries and foreign businesses have been engaged in unfair trade practices using subsidies to gain competitive advantages over highly vulnerable countries like Papua New Guinea (PNG) which are currently not equipped with the legislative and technical capacity to respond to cheap, dumped imports according to agreed international procedures of the World Trade Organization.
“PNG’s production costs are higher than most of our trading partners, and without the use of government sponsored subsidies, their products would not be as competitive in international markets. These cheap dumped goods are then imported into PNG and sold at lower-than-normal market prices posing steep competition for local manufacturers who are forced to scale down operations just to survive or even in some cases, close operations. Tariffs are, therefore, an important trade policy instrument that can address unfair trade practices,” said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru further highlighted that other countries have successfully leveraged tariffs as a negotiating tool to encourage investment into their local manufacturing industries rather than use them for fiscal purposes only.
“With most of PNG’s tariffs already zero rated, and any remaining protective tariffs envisaged to be progressively reduced under any future tariff reduction program, PNG is essentially giving away its bargaining chips when it comes to negotiating future free trade and investment deals. Through the tariff reduction program, PNG has allowed countries to freely access our markets with nothing in return.”
Minister Maru also questioned why key agencies responsible for trade and investment were left out in final decisions on tariff setting.
Minister Maru further stated, “The global trading economy is also undergoing substantial transformation driven largely by advancements in digital technology and rising geo-political tensions, PNG’s national tariff policy should therefore respond to the new realities of conducting commerce in a changing trading environment. Therefore, I am calling for an immediate and complete review of the tariff reduction program with an emphasis on inclusive and comprehensive stakeholder engagement.”
Minister Maru has directed the National Trade Office, with support from the Department of International Trade and Investment, to work with the Department of Treasury and establish a Tariff Working Group which should include agencies responsible for trade and investment, as well as private sector and the broader business trading community.
“This Group will look into strategies in which PNG’s Tariff policy can contribute to attracting investments as well as growing the domestic manufacturing sector and future trade arrangements,” said Minister Maru."

Recruit dedicates certificate to late daughter,10/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4371,,Local,Joy,Nill,"One of the six female firefighter recruits who passed out yesterday dedicated her success to her late daughter, whom she lost to cancer in 2022.
Devina Harigwo, who hails from the Sepik said she left her previous job with Corps Security to take care of her daughter but her world shattered when she lost her only child in 2022.
“I graduated with a certificate in Human Resource at IBS and with that certificate I applied to Corps Security. I worked there and also took night classes at ITI, to get my Diploma in Business Management. So, I was juggling my job and classes. I then moved and worked as an Accounts Assistant for three years and six months, however I did not manage to complete my course because of school fees.
“I got married and had a daughter, but in 2021 my daughter was diagnosed with cancer, so I left my job. I lost my daughter on the 18th of October, 2022 and I felt like my world collapsed. I thought that was the end of me and I even lost my faith.”
For two years, Devina stayed home still mourning her daughter and contemplating on life when she saw an advertisement from the PNG Fire Service, calling for applications to join the service.
“It’s through God’s grace, I am here today. He gave me the courage and confidence to look at the positive from the struggle I went through. I lost my daughter and I wanted to find a way to serve others and protect others to give me peace.
“I believe my daughter is so happy to see me help others and serve others with what I have, with love respect, dignity and pride.”
Furthermore, she made a call to women out there to be courageous and aim for anything they want to be.
“To all the females out there, you can work in a man’s field. It’s just your determination that can push you and as long as you believe in yourself you can go beyond your limitations.
Devina congratulated her cohort and the fellow women that made it through the many processes and tough trainings to be where they are now, official firefighters of the country."

Yafai’s no case submission rejected,9/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4349,,Legal,Anticipation,Nill,"Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika has ruled against the no case submission by Jacob Yafai, citing enough evidence to prosecute the substantive matter in the ongoing trial.
Salika ruled that the court cannot rule on the submission because the defense is yet to present his witness. What is before the court is evidence from the state witnesses only.
“The court is not required to weigh any evidence at the close of state evidence. The weighing of the evidence is usually done after the prosecution and when the defence put in their evidence.  This court has not reached that stage of weighing both evidence yet,” he said.
Salika therefore said the matter will proceed with a date set on June 2nd for the trial to continue.
Yafai, 43, the former deputy finance secretary, from East Sepik's Karapia village in Yangoru-Saussia, was charged with four counts each of official corruption, abuse of office, conspiracy to defraud and misappropriation of four cheque payments worth K41.8 million made to Paul Paraka Lawyers between 2012 and 2013."

Iguan disappointed with Morobe govt,8/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4335,,Politics,Anger,"Koni Iguan, Luther Wenge","Member for Markham and Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Koni Iguan, voiced his disappointment with the Morobe Provincial Government for launching projects in his electorate without his knowledge.
Eight ambitious projects were launched by the Morobe Provincial Government and administration on Tuesday, May 6th, at Watarais, in Markham district.
In attendance was Morobe Governor, Luther Wenge, provincial administrator, Max Bruten, Deputy Provincial Administrator – Infrastructure, Kissu Lucas, representatives of telecommunication and ICT companies, and other stakeholders.
The eight projects, initiated by Governor Wenge, include an ICT tower and E-library project – where 20 ICT towers will be constructed across the province, a Watarais Regional Growth Centre or township, and K92 mine royalties recognition for Watarais landowners.
A composed Markham MP and Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Koni Iguan, who was slotted into the program, told the guests and locals that he had nothing much to say as he was not consulted about the major projects that would be in his electorate.
“I will not speak much on the matter today,” said Iguan. “Why I am saying this is because all these projects that we are here for now, I was only made aware of them last night. I must be honest.
“Honourable governor, I welcome development in Markham. Remember when I came to Tutumang recently, I told you that I am interested in your plans for Markham because I have not sighted anything in the provincial budget. I was frank in my statement, which some of you might have read or seen on the news.”
Iguan was referring to the budget breakup session at Tutumang on Monday, February 24th, 2025, where he voiced his dissatisfaction after Wenge had presented an expenditure budget of K723.96 million for this year.
Iguan said he was planning on inviting the governor and his provincial administration to attend a DDA meeting, and outline their plans for Markham. However, before that could eventuate, he was notified of the multi-project launch.
The Markham MP told the governor and his delegation that if they see a lack of cooperation from the Markham DDA, that would mean they have no idea of what is going on.
To show his disappointment, Iguan did not touch the spade, nor dig the soil, to symbolise the groundbreaking of the projects in his electorate.
Meantime, in response, Governor Wenge told his administration that in future, local MPs need to be consulted about projects in their respective electorates.
Deputy Provincial Administrator – Infrastructure, Kissu Lucas, agreed that communication with the local MPs is critical, adding they will write to each DDA to support the provincial government’s ICT tower project with K1 million each.
The towers come under “Hello Hello” Project Discovery; a landmark initiative set to revolutionise digital connectivity across Morobe."

Madang police increase efforts to combat highway robberies,8/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4337,,Crime,Fear,Nill,"Madang police are actively working to address the rising incidents of highway robberies along key transportation routes.
Provincial Police Commander of Madang Province, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim emphasized that police are exploring a variety of tactical approaches to better secure the highway corridors. These include deploying additional officers to critical zones, such as the Naru section of the highway, and increasing patrol frequency along stretches between Usino junction and Naru areas identifies as hotspots for criminal activity.
“Our officers are conducting regular patrols at designated checkpoints and key spots along the highway. We are also planning to bolster our presence at the quarantine check-point at Mano, which is a strategic point for monitoring and preventing criminal movement,” Baim stated.
We are also considering the use of technology, such as surveillance cameras and increased communication systems, to monitor activity more effectively.
However, Acting Superintendent Baim acknowledged that resource limitations remain a significant hurdle, urging community cooperation as an essential component in the fight against crime.
Community involvement is vital in the ongoing efforts to curb highway robberies. Calling on residents to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity or incidents immediately. Baim highlighted that many criminals are using mobile phones to coordinate their attacks, watching police movements, and warning each other when patrols or patrol vehicles are in sight.
“Criminals are exploiting modern communication tools to evade detection. They monitor police movements and warn each other, which makes it challenging to catch them in the act. We need the community’s help to break this cycle,” Baim explained.
He urged communities to foster a culture of cooperation and transparency.
“Most of the people in these communities hold valuable information that can help us apprehend the suspects. We appeal to residents to come forward and report any suspicious activity doing so could make a difference in saving lives and properties,” Baim further stated.
Despite ongoing efforts, the PPC acknowledged that apprehending and prosecuting suspects remains a complex process.
“It takes time to gather enough evidence, especially if the criminals are not caught during the crime. Proving their involvement in court can be difficult without concrete evidence or witnesses,” he said.
He further expressed concerns about community members who benefit from these illegal activities and do not cooperate with police to enforce law and order.
“Some individuals are profiting from stolen items, and that undermines our collective efforts to establish law and order. We urge community members to resist involvement in criminal activities and to support police investigations,” Baim further expressed.
PPC Baim reiterated his call for the public to remain alert and proactive in reporting any sightings or suspicious activities or individuals acting suspiciously along the highway.
Victims of robbery or attack are encouraged to report incidents to the nearest police station immediately, providing detailed information to aid investigations.
“Every report counts. While it may take time to apprehend the criminals, our commitment remains a challenge unless and until people corporate with us to help combat highway robberies.
Police witness must come forward with providing witness statements in order to convict an offender, you cannot just report incidences and leave it to police to complete the process. He appealed to victims to help police by providing their statements and to appear in court to fully complete the investigation processes."

Teachers’ welfare discussed,7/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4323,,Education,Anticipation,Nill,"The agenda of teachers’ welfare was discussed in a recent board and head teachers' induction in New Ireland Province.
Primary school head teachers, board of management and teachers-in-charge of elementary schools, from Djaul Island, shared their challenges and experiences during the induction.
The training, which ran from Wednesday, April 30th, to Friday, May 2nd, was facilitated by Lavongai LLG school inspector, John Loga, and attended by participants from the primary schools of Djaul, Lapai, Sumuna, Kakapan and Leon, and their feeder elementary schools and board members.
Lapai Primary School’s head teacher, Polos Stanley, drew attention to the nationwide issue of shortage in teachers’ accommodation, outlining that community support is needed to ensure the completion of school projects.
“We have two teachers who are yet to come,” Stanley shared. “The reason behind their delay is accommodation.
“We went to the education office and were advised that teachers refuse to get posted if they will be forced to live in the village.
“We have our projects but we seriously need the community to rally behind the board of management and school administration to see the completion of teachers’ houses. However, we understand that we do not have the numbers, but Parents and Citizens Association does. The people are behind them. So, I’m happy that the boards are here, head teachers are here so that board of management, you are aware that if we, head teachers, do things on our own accord, our schools will be closed.”
Grace Lomba, from Piliva village and representing Djaul elementary teachers-in-charge, elaborated on the need for induction every three years, which is equivalent to one term for the school board membership.
“Board of management changes every three years, and when the new ones are appointed, they have no idea of what is expected,” Lomba stated. “And also, when head teachers keep changing, they will not be informed of their roles and responsibilities. Hence, I agree with the suggestion that a committee should be formed to conduct awareness. This way, people will be informed.”
The two-day training covered financial management, Board of Management roles and responsibilities, head teacher’s checklist, human resource policy and national standard for schools, teachers and students.
Host of the training venue, Djaul Primary School head teacher, Maris Kombeng, said the induction was organised by the schools in collaboration with the office of the school inspector as part of their capacity building program.
He thanked the facilitator for outlining the responsibilities of the head teachers and board members, their structure, general standard operating procedures and the correct channel of reporting."
Dr Billy launches review into Disaster Emergency Response Mechanism,7/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4310,,Government,Trust,Billy Joseph,"Minister for Defence, Dr Billy Joseph has launched the Review into the Disaster Emergency and Response Mechanism last night in Port Moresby.
Dr Billy announced that the National Executive Council approved the Review under NEC Decision number 300/2024 with an intention of establishing a disaster Management mechanism called National Emergency Management Authority (NEMA).
The Government intends to set up NEMA as a long-term strategy aimed at establishing an effective process of managing the impacts of disasters, in which provincial governments, LLGs and the communities should work together to better prepare for, respond to, and recover from naturally occurring and rapid onset events that cause serious disruptions to communities.
The launch of the Review into the Disaster Emergency and Response Mechanism marks a significant step forward in disaster management for the country.
“The establishment of this authority aims to create a comprehensive disaster management framework designed to enhance collaboration among provincial governments, local level governments (LLGs), and communities.
“The primary goal of NEMA is to develop a sustainable, long-term strategy that focuses on effectively managing the impacts of both natural disasters and rapid onset events.”
This initiative highlights the importance of preparedness, response, and recovery processes, ensuring that local communities are better equipped to face disruptions caused by disasters.
Dr Billy said by fostering cooperation and coordinated efforts at various levels of government and engaging communities directly, the authority intends to build resilience and improve overall disaster response capabilities across the nation.
The government has developed the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the establishment of NEMA and engaged a team of eminent experts to review all the existing legislations in relation to addressing disasters and emergencies to ensure the risks of disasters are reduced and managed effectively in the country.
The Review Team will be led by Ray Paul – former Commissioner of Customs and will be assisted by Retired Major General Gilbert Toropo and former Chief of Emergency Medicine at Port Moresby General Hospital Dr. Sam Yockopua.
The review will basically set the stage for the establishment of NEMA which will bring together players in Disaster Response and Management together under one organization for effective prevention, response and management of natural and man-made disasters.
About K5m has been allocated for the set up of NEMA."
Eviction notice served on illegal settlers,7/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4313,,Local,Fear,Nill,"The Livestock Development Corporation estimates that close to 1,000 settlers will be evicted from portion 234 at Three-Mile, in Lae.
On Monday, May 5th, 40 eviction notices were delivered to those who were illegally squatting on portion 234.
LDC’s lawyer, Justin Issack, and finance manager, Otto Wangillen, were on ground to ensure all the notices were given to police in Lae, who then served them to the settlers. The notice gives them 60 days to move out of the area.
“Situation on the ground is quiet but tense as slowly word is getting out and around that LDC is reclaiming back the State land as the rightful landowner or legal entity with legitimate title,” confirmed Wangillen.
“The eviction will affect close to 1,000 settlers who are from every parts of PNG and have squatted on the area with second and third generation of people.”
The May 1 notice, signed by LDC Managing Director, Terry Koim, directs settlers to vacate the land by June 30, 2025, or face forced removal.
“All settlers must vacate and remove any unauthorised structures – including homes, trade stores, churches and schools – constructed without LDC’s consent,” Koim said."
PNG Reignites National Anti-Human Trafficking Effort,7/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4316,,Government,Anticipation,Nill,"Papua New Guinea has taken a significant step forward in revitalizing its national response to Trafficking in Persons (TIP) with the convening of the first National Anti-Human Trafficking Committee (NAHTC) meeting since 2022.
Held on April 10 and 17, 2025, at Lamana Hotel in Port Moresby by the Department of Justice and Attorney General, the two-day meeting marks the first NAHTC gathering since 2022, signaling a renewed momentum in addressing the country’s human trafficking challenges.
While the first session, held on April 10, 2025, served as a crucial reset after a prolonged period without meetings, the second session, on April 17, 2025, focused on finalizing Papua New Guinea's submission of the Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, an annual status update on the state of anti-trafficking efforts. Comprising representatives from a range of government entities, the committee meeting was also instrumental in advancing a common understanding on the trafficking situation in Papua New Guinea and supporting a whole-of-government response, laying the foundation for the development of a National Action Plan to systematically address and combat the multifaceted challenges of human trafficking in the country. The renewed focus and structured approach in the meeting underscores Papua New Guinea's commitment to enhancing its TIP response and implementing effective measures to protect vulnerable populations.
Representing DJAG, Josephine Pitmur, Deputy Secretary, acknowledged the strong collaboration among stakeholders and emphasized the need for coordinated action.
“Each organization plays a vital role in this effort,” she said. “We need to strengthen our coordination and understand the specific functions each agency has in addressing trafficking in persons so we can improve our collective response as a country.”
“The Criminal Code Act 1975 has been amended to include provisions on people smuggling and trafficking in persons, a vital step in regulating both domestic and cross-border trafficking. These reforms are a crucial part of strengthening PNG's mechanisms and responses to trafficking,” she said.
Commissioner of Police, David Manning, raised concerns over the limited progress since the last NAHTC meeting.
“We’ve only had one successful trafficking conviction in PNG. There are many more cases — some undetected or unreported. A better-informed society can recognize these crimes and report them. Let’s not wait until it becomes a bigger issue. Let’s act now before we are overwhelmed.”
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) also presented key global findings.
Fatiaki, Officer-in-Charge of the UNODC Programme Office in PNG, shared insights from the 2024 Global TIP Report, noting:
“There’s been a 25 percent global increase in detected trafficking victims since pre-pandemic levels, with child victims — particularly girls trafficked for sexual exploitation — rising by 31 percent. Alarmingly, forced labour now surpasses sexual exploitation as the leading form of detected trafficking. This makes it even more critical that we accelerate national and regional action.”
David Arnold, Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), emphasized the broader risks that drive trafficking.
“Human trafficking intersects with wider crises and creates opportunities for exploitation. Strengthening prevention, protection, and prosecution through collective action is essential. IOM commends the Government for reconvening the Committee and remains committed to building a whole-of-society approach to safeguard the most vulnerable.”
Arnold emphasized that completing the TIP report inputs is a critical first step toward shaping a responsive and effective National Action Plan.
“There are many steps ahead, but this momentum is vital, and IOM stands ready to support the Secretariat and all partners moving forward.”
During the meeting, government agencies shared updates on their respective efforts to combat human trafficking. These presentations not only informed the TIP questionnaire responses but also reinforced the collaborative approach PNG is taking to address this pressing issue.
Government agencies represented at the meeting included the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC), Department of Labour and Industrial Relations (DLIR), Office of the Public Prosecutor, Immigration and Citizenship Services Authority (ICSA), National Fisheries Authority, and Papua New Guinea Forest Authority. Also, in attendance were and the Department of Justice and Attorney General, the lead agency, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reaffirming their ongoing commitment to supporting Papua New Guinea’s anti-trafficking efforts through technical assistance and collaboration. The meeting was supported by the IOM’s Development Fund.
With renewed political will and multisectoral engagement, the NAHTC is poised to deliver stronger, coordinated action against trafficking in persons in Papua New Guinea — reaffirming the country’s commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of its most vulnerable."
ICAC raises concern over underreporting of corruption cases,7/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4320,,Government,Anger,Nill,"The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is concerned that despite public reports of potential corruption by high-ranking government officials, they have not received any official complaint about these incidents.
ICAC’s Deputy Commissioner Operations Daniel Baulch  said in the last fortnight, there were publicly reported incidents regarding potential corruption by high-ranking government members and politicians. This includes a letter allegedly from the Minister for Finance, instructing the release of approximately K73 million in outstanding payments to multiple businesses. Days later, one of the dailies reported that the Prime Minister had intervened to halt those payments in recent days, further leading to the replacement of the Finance Minister.
“Additionally, just last week, media reports revealed that a court determined on the civil standard that the Mining Minister paid bribes in the form of vehicles and cash to influence votes during the election. And yet, despite these stories, no official report of suspected corrupt conduct has been made to ICAC about these matters. Their silence speaks volumes,” he said.
He said part IV Section 45 (1) of the Organic Law on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (OLICAC) requires that all leaders who are subject to the Leadership Code report suspected corrupt conduct to the ICAC. There are those who likely failed in their legal obligation to report. Again, the ICAC is left to proactively chase what others fear to face.
“Let's be clear: corruption in PNG is not just about money- it causes real harm. It keeps people from getting healthcare, education, or jobs. It fuels violence. And in some cases, it even leads to death.
“Despite the claims that ICAC has the laws it needs, repeated requests for legislative cooperation are met with silence. Our letters and requests are often ignored. Meetings don't happen. Court processes are delayed. Even simple things like getting search or arrest warrants can be blocked. For over twelve months, we have submitted frameworks, drafted national responses, and sought high-level coordination to confront PNG's corruption and crime epidemic,” he said.
“We are again asking all leaders in government and public service to work with us, take action. Do your duty. Stand up against corruption,” Baulch added.
ICAC’s Deputy Commissioner Operations Daniel Baulch issued this call during a media conference in Port Moresby today."

He said the Lae Market plays a crucial role as an economic hub for families, small-scale producers, and informal vendors from across Morobe and beyond.
“For many people in Morobe and surrounding provinces, the Lae Market is their entry point into the economy. This redevelopment will make that entry point safer, more accessible and more dignified,” Mr Kanowski said.
Features of the New Market Facility
The redeveloped Lae Main Market will be a two-storey dual pavilion complex, equipped with:
- SME kiosks and commercial stalls
- Vendor offices and a dedicated vendor entry
- Secure customer parking

False news peddlers warned,7/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4328,,Local,Fear,Nill,"Simbu Provincial Police Commander Superintendent Mazuc Rubiang has called on the people of Simbu to report any sorcery accusation- related violence to the police as soon as they occur, and refrain from spreading false rumors that may cause fear in the community.
PPC Rubiang made this call following social media posts on Facebook that were forwarded to him regarding four sorcery accusation-related cases.
According to him, his office has not received any information. He stated that the Facebook posts claimed that four cases of this nature were reported, including a woman who was burnt in her small hut at Gumine, a woman and her son who were chopped in Kerowagi, a young man in Gumine who was brutally murdered and thrown into a toilet pit, and another report of a woman who was tortured and thrown alive into a toilet pit, claiming that the police and Tribal Foundation are working on addressing it.
""My office had not received anything regarding this posted on Facebook, so it might be false. So far, Simbu province is quiet, and if such incidents are happening in remote parts of the province, people must report them to the police so we can seek help from our leaders to assist the victim,"" PPC Rubiang said.
He urged Simbu police officers and government officials to work collaboratively with his office to disseminate vital information to responsible authorities so that they can act swiftly if and when a crime occurs.
He also warned peddlers of false news they will be investigated and charged accordingly if caught by the police. He said such reports tarnish the name of the province and restrict the movement of people and tourists into the province."

PM Marape applauds OTML,6/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4294,,Business,Joy,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has extended his congratulations to the Board, management, and workforce of Ok Tedi Mining Ltd (OTML) for achieving a record K1.85 billion in revenue during the first quarter of 2025, delivering K681 million in net profit after tax.
“This exceptional result is a testament to what Papua New Guineans can accomplish when entrusted with the stewardship of our natural resources,” said Marape.
“Ok Tedi, being 100% nationally owned, embodies our vision of resource nationalism and demonstrates how revenue and profits can flow back to our landowners, provinces, and the national budget.”
The Prime Minister recalled that one of his first provincial visits after taking office in 2019 was to Western Province, where he issued clear policy direction for OTML to extend its mine life and improve operational efficiency.
“I am pleased the management team took our policy direction seriously. The extension of Ok Tedi’s life to 2050 is a direct result of those early decisions. We now see the benefits through increased output and financial returns,” he said.
OTML has projected it will generate over K40 billion in benefits over the next 26 years, which includes dividends, royalties, taxes, and compensation payments.
Prime Minister Marape welcomed these figures, saying they reinforce the strategic importance of OTML to national development.
“This revenue — and more importantly, the profit — is what we can use to build schools, fund hospitals, and support rural development. OTML is truly our flagship mine,” he said.
He also reaffirmed the Government’s support for the ongoing Community Mine Continuation Agreement (CMCA) review, emphasising the importance of securing social licence and ensuring benefits continue to reach landowners and impacted communities.
“The extension of the mine must not come at the cost of our environment or the rights of our people. I am assured that environmental and social standards are being elevated under the current management,” he said.
Looking to the future, Marape reiterated his government’s broader vision to turn the Tabubil-Kiunga corridor into a diversified economic zone through downstream processing, agriculture, training institutions, and renewable energy initiatives.
“In fact, I have directed Kumul Minerals Holdings Ltd (KMHL) to explore establishing a new subsidiary that brings together PNG’s own mining professionals to run mines domestically or export their services abroad. OTML’s performance proves that we can run our own mining enterprises – and do it well.”
He also highlighted the importance of critical infrastructure investment to support OTML’s future operations and open new economic frontiers.
“The Government’s Connect PNG initiative is playing a vital role in de-risking business operations. The new road corridor linking Western Province to the Indonesian border is expected to be completed by the end of this year. We are also opening access from Kiunga to the Aiambak deep-water port and establishing connections to the Highlands Highway. These projects will help safeguard mine operations during dry weather and unlock commercial opportunities for the region,” he stated.

Customary Land Song Sparks National Reflection,6/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4303,,Culture,Joy,Nill,"A powerful new song and music video celebrating the importance of customary land in Papua New Guinea has been launched by advocacy group ACT NOW! in partnership with Starbox Production, as part of a national campaign to protect and promote the country’s most vital asset.
""We are glad to partner with ACT NOW! to promote this very important message. Music, if utilised well, has the power to create better understanding, raise awareness, and hopefully bring positive changes in our communities,"" said Starbox Band Manager, Willie Sarenga.
In Papua New Guinea, customary land is not just ground underfoot — it is the heart of life, linking the earth and sky, the sea and clouds, the past and the future. It is the source of identity, pride, community, and sustenance, deeply woven into the social and spiritual fabric of every Papua New Guinean.
""Our customary land is where we are born and where we return when we die. It connects us with our ancestors and with those yet to come. It provides us with a sense of place, binds us to our history, and secures our future,"" ACT NOW! stated.
Unlike the Western concept of land as a commodity that can be bought and sold, customary land in PNG carries enormous community, spiritual, environmental, and cultural values. It is held collectively and managed through local customs and laws that have adapted and evolved over generations.
""Customary land is neither mine nor yours but a gift we hold in trust as custodians for past and future generations,"" ACT NOW! emphasised. ""It sustains us physically and spiritually, provides food, shelter, and medicine, and supports our cultures, governance, and social stability.""
Sarenga noted that with PNG marking its 50th year of independence, the timing is right to reflect on the nation’s greatest asset.
""As the country turns 50 this year, it’s important for us to rethink and refocus on the wise management of our natural resources. We are only custodians. We are inspired and look forward to more engagements to promote such important messages.""
The song and music video are now available for free on ACT NOW!'s YouTube channel.

SHP men charged with forgery,6/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4291,,Crime,Trust,Nill,"Two men from Southern Highlands Province were arrested at Police Headquarters in Konedobu last week for allegedly producing a letter bearing a forged signature of the Police Commissioner.
The fraud was discovered among documents seeking K4.6 million in counterpart funding for the construction of police infrastructure in the Southern Highlands Province.
Police Commissioner, David Manning, commended the RPNGC’s Infrastructure Project Team, led by the Chief of Administration, Deputy Commissioner Philip Mitna, for their diligence in the vetting process that detected the fraud.
“The RPNGC has stringent accountability procedures in place to prevent criminal activities.  The two men, both aged in their 40’s from Southern Highlands Province, were quickly detained and will now be prosecuted.
“They are being charged with one count each of forgery. These are serious offences that carry terms of imprisonment.
“These arrests stand as a further warning to fraudsters attempting to defraud government agencies that you will be caught and arrested.
“Our accountability and oversight mechanisms have been strengthened over recent years, ensuring that attempts by criminals to take advantage of unprecedented Government support is quickly identified and mitigated”
Commissioner Manning said all police infrastructure projects funded by the government through the Special Police Assistance Program (SPAP) are done so in conformance with standard procedures set by the National Procurement Commission.
“Our aim is to ensure that government funds disbursed through SPAP funding are transparently and prudently expended on quality infrastructure.
“This includes construction to address historic underinvestment since Independence. With the assistance of Government through the Special Police Assistance Program, we are now able to invest in that infrastructure that supports frontline police officers.
“This new infrastructure will support our police officers around the country, strengthening law and order outcomes for all communities.”"
NEC appoints PNG-Indo Trade Commissioner,6/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4292,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"The National Executive Council’s (NEC) has approved the appointment of Seline Leo-Lohia as the Trade Commissioner of Papua New Guinea to the Republic of Indonesia.
Prime Minister Marape described this as a “very strategic appointment”.
“Papua New Guinea and Indonesia are close neighbors but are yet to fully explore the possibilities of our cooperation. For the last 49 years our focus has been on border and security talks annually. These have not led to improvement of our border facilities, direct shipping links, creation of jobs, or significant export between our two countries. It is time PNG develops a strong, deep, and robust relationship with Indonesia in realising the potential of both countries in trade and investment, and appointment of Ms. Leo-Lohia is the start of the shift in focus to the commercial dimension of our relationship with Indonesia. Ms. Leo-Lohia will be the direct link between the private sector of our two countries and the PNG-Indonesia Business Council,” said Prime Minister Marape.
Prime Minister further highlighted the need for PNG to partner Indonesia which is the now the world’s fourth most populous nation, the largest economy in Southeast Asia, and the seventh largest in terms of purchasing power parity.
“Indonesia’s economic base has shifted from the primary sector to secondary and tertiary industries and strengthening its position in downstream processing and adding value in manufacturing, trade, and services. The country’s transition from primary production to tertiary production is also aided by the establishment of economic zones. Indonesia now has 118 Industrial Parks, 15 SEZs, 4 Free Trade Zones and 10 Tourism Zones and these economic zones contributed significantly to the government’s policy on downstream processing and value addition of its natural resources.”
“Indonesia is a global player in mining, including the extraction of oil and natural gas being a key contributor to Indonesia’s GDP. Indonesia has ranked among the world’s third largest coal and nickel producers. Downstream processing has been relatively successful- thousands of jobs have been created, higher-value skills have been transferred, and advanced technological and economic processes have been brought to Indonesia. The nickel SEZ alone created 80,000 jobs and 12,000 indirect jobs at Weda Bay - only one SEZ created more jobs than the jobs created by entire PNG mining and petroleum industry”
Prime Minister Marape said, “PNG has immense potential with abundant natural resources in mining, petroleum, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and services for downstream processing value addition respectively. There is no better place to learn from than Indonesia which has already mastered this approach.
“The most valuable lesson PNG can learn from Indonesia is how they have mastered downstream processing and value addition, and how we can implement similar strategies in PNG. We do not have to look far- Indonesia, our closest neighbor has successfully navigated this path and is now a formidable player on the global stage. They are willing to share their experience and expertise, and we must stand ready to learn from them and collaborate with them. With the appointment of our Trade Commissioner, we are also looking at attracting serious Indonesian investment into PNG.”"

Moving projects for Middle Ramu,6/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4290,,Development,Anticipation,Wai Rapa,"The Baiyer-Middle Ramu road resonates strongly with Middle Ramu’s cry for connectivity and accessibility to services.
On Saturday May 03rd, 2025, locals gathered in Ruti Valley to witness the arrival of the two brand new excavators purchased recently by the Middle Ramu District Development Authority (DDA) for road construction. There the Open MP Kansol Kamdaru outlined some of the projects that will be delivered in the coming weeks.
Kamdaru said there has been little tangible development in the district to date. This is obvious with deteriorating public infrastructure built during the precolonial days. The Middle Ramu DDA is backing education and health needs with funding.
For example, a 40% school subsidy has been allocated from the budget for infrastructure projects for 14 schools. The challenge now is transporting the materials which the MP said will be addressed with a freight subsidy from the national government.
On Friday 2nd May and Saturday 3rd May, Minister for Works & Highways met in Mt Hagen his department secretary Gibson Holemba, Middle Ramu MP Kansol Kamdaru, Western Highlands Governor Wai Rapa and Mul-Baiyer MP Jacob Maki, to learn first-hand the progress on the Baiyer-Madang Road.
During the trip, they visited Aiome Secondary School in Middle Ramu, where Governor Rapa and the Mul-Baiyer MP made a K200,000 commitment to the school for a new science lab.
Acknowledging the challenges of Middle Ramu district, MP Kamdaru, as a first-time MP, resolved he would deliver as much as he can for his people before the next election. One of his achievements was the creation of Wanuma Local Level Government. Wanuma LLG is currently running its first LLG election. Kamdaru presented K500, 000 to LLG executives to build a LLG chamber so it could have its first meeting this September."
"PNG, Indonesia to further trade, investment relations",5/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4282,,Business,Anticipation,"James Marape, John Rosso, Richard Maru","Preparations are underway for the launch of the Papua New Guinea – Indonesia Business Council Inc.
Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru has confirmed that the PNG–Indonesia Business Council will be launched by Prime Minister James Marape on Wednesday, May 7, at the National Parliament’s State Function Room.
Minister Maru said, “PNG and Indonesia are close neighbours connected by land border, but have not developed the trade and investment relationship between the two countries through any structured formal relationships.
“We are so close, yet so far away in terms of trade and investment. For the last 49 years, our focus has been on border and security talks annually. It is time PNG develops a strong, deep, and robust relationship with Indonesia in realizing the potential of both countries in trade and investment.”
Maru said the launch of the PNG-Indonesia Business Council is the start of the shift in focus to the commercial dimension of our relationship with Indonesia. Their main job is to liaise with the Indonesian private sector to drive trade and investment between the two countries.
He said major foreign direct investments from Indonesia are a priority.
Indonesia is currently the world’s fourth most populous nation, the largest economy in Southeast Asia, and the seventh largest in terms of purchasing power parity.
Indonesia is a global player in mining, including the extraction of oil and natural gas, which is a key contributor to Indonesia’s GDP.
Indonesia has ranked among the world’s third-largest coal and nickel producers. Downstream processing has been relatively successful- thousands of jobs have been created, higher-value skills have been transferred, and advanced technological and economic processes have been brought to Indonesia.
“We do not have a major Indonesian investor in PNG, when they are world leaders in many sectors today. They have a huge market and have many companies that can invest in PNG, but we have never leveraged the closeness of our relationship by learning from their success and bringing their companies to invest in PNG.
“PNG has immense potential with abundant natural resources in mining, petroleum, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and services for downstream processing value addition, respectively. There is no better place to learn from than Indonesia, which has already mastered this approach,” said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru further stated, “Thank you to the friendship of our former and current Prime Minister and the former and current President of Indonesia. They have really set the basis for us to now take our relationship to the next level. It has taken use 50 years to reach a point where we are now able to have a PNG- Indonesia Business Council and we also now have a Ministerial Committee led by the Deputy Prime Minister, Hon. John Rosso, MP. We are now ready to step up in our relationship.”
“We are hoping to secure the first K1.5 billion Indonesian investment in our country in the coming weeks,” added Minister Maru."

“This program has been initiated by the Lae City Authority through a submission that was made by the Lae city independence celebration committee to initiate this program after dreaming about it 20 years ago. After 20 years, it is happening; we are going to have our own city pipes and drums.”
Assistant Commissioner of Police – Northern Command, Peter Guinness, told the 15 women and 25 men that they need to change their mindsets and be more disciplined.
“Whatever bad behaviour that you have, you need to let it go,” said ACP Guinness. “You are in the training environment; this is a military base. Your behaviour, your attitude must change.
“After you all graduate, you will be reporting to the metropolitan superintendent. He (Chris Kunyanban) will be your immediate boss, while I am the overall boss.”
The training was officially opened by Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, who emphasised that the band will promote Lae’s community pride and enhance national unity.
The program intends to establish a dedicated 30-member marching band. Its focus will be on showcasing the unique traditions of the Scottish bagpipe and drums model that is practiced by the PNG Defence Force and other disciplined forces.
The trainees will get a fortnightly allowance of K200 until their graduation after five months, where they will get additional allowance when they join the main reserve training program.

Vipers are among the few formed teams this season, starting on a high note, and this was shown in their match against Waghi Tumbe when they recovered from a six-point deficit to claim a comprehensive win.
Waghi Tumbe led at half time 12-6 and was on track for an upset win. But the inspiration in the sheds came from Vipers' coach, Brendon Gotuno, who motivated his side to win the game.
“During the first half, we made too many errors in the second half, I told the boys that we had to stay disciplined, complete our sets, and play what we trained for. And the boys did that,” said Gotuno.
He added that the Vipers remained disciplined, minimised errors and were rewarded with a win.
The Vipers veteran and team Captain, Gilmore Paul, scored a hat-trick and led his team to a strong win, who was later named player of the match.
Paul said, "" In the second half, our coach told us to polish up our games and do our jobs individually, who will contribute to overall team performance, and we came up with that in the second half and won the game.""
Paul attributed the win to the team’s overall performance and applauded the boys for the strong game.
Tumbe coach, Tony Dai, said it was a fair game. His side couldn't nail a win in the end due to sloppy play, but Dai lauded Vipers for a good match day.

LDC Issues Eviction Notice to 3 Mile Settlers in Lae,5/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4264,,Business,Fear,"John Boito, John Rosso, Sekie Agisa","The Livestock Development Corporation Limited (LDC) has issued an official eviction notice to all illegal settlers occupying Portion 234 at 3 Mile, Lae, directing them to vacate the land by June 30, 2025, or face forced removal.
The notice, signed by LDC Managing Director Terry Koim and dated May 1, confirms that Portion 234 is a legally registered State Lease held by LDC.
The public is advised that police will begin serving eviction notices today, Monday, May 5, at the 3 Mile Police Station. Awareness activities were conducted on Sunday, May 5th, to inform residents of the legal grounds and implications.
Importantly, the Certificate of Authorisation to Occupy (CAO) on Portion 234 previously held by DAL was formally transferred to LDC by a decision of the then DAL secretary and senior statesman, Noreo Beangke, in a letter addressed to the Secretary for Lands dated June 19, 1987.
“All settlers must vacate and remove any unauthorised structures—including homes, trade stores, churches and schools—constructed without LDC’s consent,” Mr Koim said.
He explained that following LDC’s closure in Lae in 1994, settlers unlawfully occupied the land and removed staff from the Department of Agriculture and Livestock (DAL) and the National Agriculture Quarantine and Inspection Authority (NAQIA). He reaffirmed that the land has never been disposed of by LDC to any person or entity.
“This land has always remained a government asset under LDC. It is not for private use or occupation,” Mr Koim said.
The eviction directive is supported by legal and administrative authorities:
-	A Prime Ministerial directive dated 17 March 2020, instructing LDC to recover its assets across PNG;
-	A public warning from Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Lands John Rosso stating that illegal settlers on State land face eviction without compensation.
-	A general directive from the Secretary for Lands and Physical Planning warning illegal occupants nationwide;
-	Public notices issued in May 2020 by the DAL Secretary and LDC Board Chairman urging the voluntary evacuation of LDC-owned lands.
“This eviction is part of our ongoing efforts to reclaim vital State properties for future agricultural and livestock development,” Mr Koim said.
“We call on all settlers to comply peacefully. No compensation will be paid as their occupancy is illegal.”
The LDC has already successfully reclaimed State assets in several provinces, including Central, East Sepik, Eastern Highlands, Morobe, Western Highlands, and Madang.
Concerned residents are encouraged to contact LDC’s General Manager Operations, Steven Yangis, on 7290 6709 for further guidance.
The notice was also copied to DPM Rosso, Minister for Livestock Sekie Agisa, Minister for Agriculture John Boito, key departmental secretaries, the Morobe Provincial Police Commander, and legal representatives."
Marape clarifies court’s decision,5/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4267,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has responded to questions regarding matters raised in court decisions involving certain political leaders.
Marape clarified that while the court proceedings did refer to the conduct of some individuals, these persons were not principal parties to the case.
“I wish to make it clear that the individuals mentioned were not the primary complainants or defendants in this matter,” he said.
“Their names were raised through inferences made during the court’s deliberation based on evidence adduced, but they were not the principal offenders or parties directly involved.”
He said that the matters were essentially court proceedings in which evidence led to commentary or observations, rather than direct charges against the said leaders.
“These are matters of court inference and commentary, and as such, I do not believe it is appropriate at this point in time to take any specific position on the matters. The court has issued its findings, but we must be careful not to mischaracterize the nature of those findings or elevate them beyond their legal context.”
The Prime Minister urged the media and the public to approach the issue with responsibility, noting that respect for the due process of law and proper legal interpretation must prevail over political commentary or public speculation.
“As a government that upholds the rule of law, we respect the independence of the judiciary. However, it is also important that we do not politicise or misrepresent what are essentially legal interpretations made in proceedings where these leaders were not directly on trial.”
The Prime Minister concluded by affirming his commitment to transparent and accountable governance, while also maintaining fairness and due process in responding to judicial outcomes."

Father appeals for better medical service,4/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4257,,Health,Sadness,Nill,"A grieving father is appealing for better medical services after his daughter passed away from a prolonged sickness two weeks before her graduation.
Terah Baloiloi, father of the late Jolana Baloiloi, courageously attended the University of PNG graduation among the graduates to receive his daughter’s degree.
The School of Humanities and Social Sciences saw 275 graduates from the University of Papua New Guinea. The event was also bittersweet for the Baloiloi family, who lost Jolana two weeks before her graduation.
Her father shared with this newsroom how vibrant a young woman his daughter was.
“I tell Jolana’s siblings to stay strong and follow in her footsteps, as she left behind a legacy. My wife and I ensure we provide all the support our children need to better their education. Jolana was my oldest daughter, and I want to make sure her siblings follow through and do well in their education like her.”
Mr Baloiloi braved the entire ceremony to collect his daughter’s degree when her name was called. He encouraged parents and others who are faced with a similar situation to remain strong.
“I had to gain the strength to come today, my wife and I, our message to parents out there who are going through the same situation is that we have got to move on in life. We have to move on; Jolana’s achievements are our achievements, and we are proud of her.
Although he accepts his late daughter’s death at such a young age, he believes she would have been cured with proper medical care. Jolana would have graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Archaeology. She would have represented fifty-three percent of the female graduates, marking a significant accomplishment for the school.
“I wish we had better medical facilities, her sickness was curable. I call on the responsible authorities to look into this and improve our medical services. This will save our future generation, and they are what our country needs.”

The session highlighted the use and the abuse of AI, how the universities are handling AI use from students, and how to overcome the challenges faced.
""The downside of AI is that it can be misused, and we want to put in place strategies that will ensure that students are using it properly.
But we are strong on ethics, and we teach it as a unit, and students have to pass it, and if they don't, they don't graduate, they come back and do the ethical side of issues.
This also applies to media in general, is something that we hold really important, and so that's one way we try to, in our formation of the students, help them to understand that, yes, there are short cuts you can do things and probably get away with it, but ethically, is that the right way To do things? And we also help our students to understand that the environment around which they live and study is going through this whole problem that we are facing, the development of technology with AI coming in.
This is affecting the environment in which they are working,"" said Matbob.
""We need guidelines in a way people need to know how to communicate using the particular tool, and at the perspective of that in the university level, we are the administration and the practitioners.
""We are looking at having  policies in place in which students in a way perform, and they use that academically,"" continued Dr. Aisoli-Orake.
She added that journalism writing has to be done responsibly. She shared that policies have to be developed, however, for Unitech it's in the infant stages and over the last two years, there were discussions and drafting of policy in relation to AI use in the university.

TIPNG calls PM to action,2/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4233,,Politics,Anticipation,Allan Bird,"Transparency International Papua New Guinea (TIPNG) in noting the Prime Minister's media statement made after defeating the motion of Vote of No Confidence (VONC), is now urging him to take action against corruption.
Now his tenure is secured for the remaining term of this parliament, TIPNG urged the Prime Minister to to drive forward the reforms that are required to strengthen governance and accountability in Papua New Guinea.
“The time for talk is over. Papua New Guinea’s poor ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) should be a major worry for the PM as it reflects a widespread level of corruption in the public sector and taking serious action to address this should be his immediate priority,” said TIPNG Chair, Peter Aitsi.
TIPNG called on the PM to take the following actions:
1.	Sack Non-Performers: The Prime Minister must sack people who are not-performing, this includes Ministers, Department Secretaries, Commissioners, and CEOs. It is time to send a clear message that incompetence, negligence and non-performance will no longer be tolerated. Seek out persons who are capable, experienced and qualified and recruit them under merit-based system with a focus on individuals who have demonstrated high degrees of integrity in their past roles.
2.	 Press forward with the Electoral Reforms: Be the Champion for the Parliamentary Committee Report Chaired by ESP Governor Allan Bird on Election Reform. Lead the presentation of report to Parliament and focus parliament on agreeing and prioritizing the changes needed in order to safeguard the integrity of the 2027 National Elections, in the short remaining time. Given that PNG is now 18 months away from the 2027 National Elections, TIPNG calls
for a specific focus on the 3 key areas:
a.	Restore Governance in the Electoral Commission: Appointment of additional commissioners, at least 3, who are qualified, experienced and independent of politics.
b.	Commit to transparency: Publish the current Common Roll online and establish a process for citizens to check and if required re-register themselves.
c.	Early and consistent release of funding for the PNG Electoral Commission to support their operations and preparation. If required appoint an external accounting firm to manage on behalf of the Electoral Commission.
3.	Full Implementation of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations: The government needs to take immediate action to implement the Financial Action Task Force (FAFT) recommendations. This is crucial in order for Papua New Guinea to come out of the grey listing.
4.	Enhance public accountability through the enactment of a Right to Information Law and the establishment of robust oversight mechanisms.
5.	Strengthening Integrity Institutions: The government must strengthen and fully resource integrity institutions, including giving full authority and mandate to the National Anti-Corruption Agencies.
6.
Furthermore, TIPNG said the National Anti-Corruption Strategy Task Force must convene regularly to ensure progress on critical anti-corruption initiatives.
“Addressing corruption is fundamental if we are to see continued economic growth and attract foreign direct investment. We acknowledge the Prime Minister’s focus on transforming key sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and fisheries, but these efforts will be wasted if we fail to acknowledge that corruption is the impediment to realizing the full potential of these sectors,” added the TIPNG Chair.
TIPNG says it stands ready to work collaboratively with the government and all stakeholders to advance these critical reforms, saying “he time for action is now!”"

APEC countries urged to demonstrate leadership on climate effects,1/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4219,,International,Anticipation,Jelta Wong,"Papua New Guinea (PNG) has called on APEC member economies to demonstrate bold and inclusive climate leadership, not only by reducing emissions but also by scaling up support for adaptation, including technology transfer and climate finance.
The theme for this year’s APEC Ocen-Related Ministerial Meeting, “Navigating Our Blue Future: Connection, Innovation, and Prosperity”, resonates deeply with PNG’s national development goals and aligns with the broader vision outlined in the 2050 Blue Pacific Strategy.
Speaking at the meeting in Busan, South Korea, Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources, Jelta Wong, emphasized the urgent need for collective action as Pacific Island nations face the frontlines of climate impacts.
Minister Wong urged APEC economies to show leadership by going beyond mitigation efforts to include robust support for climate adaptation, technology transfer, and targeted climate finance.
“We are already witnessing rising sea levels, ocean acidification, and increasingly frequent extreme weather events that threaten our coastal communities and marine ecosystems,” Minister Wong stated. “We call on all APEC economies to pair mitigation efforts with substantial adaptation support. The time to act decisively is now.”
Minister Wong welcomed the Busan Ocean Declaration 2025, noting its alignment with Papua New Guinea’s national development goals and the broader aspirations of the 2050 Blue Pacific Strategy. He expressed PNG’s strong support for regional action that fosters innovation, prosperity, and effective ocean governance.
He reaffirmed Papua New Guinea’s commitment to the Busan Ocean Declaration 2025 and outlined the country’s vision for the blue economy, emphasizing a balance between economic development, ocean health, cultural heritage, and community resilience.
“Our ocean is central to our identity and prosperity,” Minister Wong said.
“Our blue economy model reflects this interconnectedness, and our policies must ensure that economic growth does not come at the cost of ecosystem degradation.”
Minister Wong identified three key areas where Papua New Guinea is taking action and seeking stronger regional collaboration:
Climate Adaptation through Nature-Based Solutions
PNG is restoring over 1,000 hectares of mangrove ecosystems through the Mangrove Rehabilitation for Livelihoods initiative.
These blue carbon ecosystems absorb emissions, protect shorelines, support biodiversity, and sustain community livelihoods.
Combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing
With enhanced vessel monitoring systems and regional observer programs, PNG is committed to eliminating IUU fishing.
Minister Wong urged APEC members to invest in traceability technologies, strengthen cross-border intelligence sharing, and support the WTO’s efforts to end harmful fisheries subsidies.
Maximizing Tuna Value Retention
While PNG’s waters account for roughly 10% of the regional tuna catch, much of it is exported without value addition.
To address this, the East New Britain Initiative has been launched to enhance local processing and ensure equitable benefit-sharing.
The initiative aims to:
-	Establish a Regional Fisheries Development Fund to catalyze investment in the fisheries value chain;
-	Launch an East New Britain Sustainability Label in partnership with international certifiers to promote traceability and responsible sourcing;
-	Build equitable partnerships with distant-water fishing nations to ensure fairer benefit-sharing and local economic opportunities.
“The East New Britain Initiative is a strategic blueprint for building value chains that benefit both our people and our environment,” said Minister Wong.
Minister Wong also highlighted that while the Western and Central Pacific Ocean supplies more than half of the world’s tuna, Pacific Island countries like PNG capture only a small portion of the full economic value. He announced the implementation of the East New Britain Initiative, a strategic national and regional plan aimed at fostering inclusive growth, value retention, and infrastructure development in the fisheries sector.
“The East New Britain Initiative represents a bold, inclusive approach to a more resilient blue economy. It embodies our commitment to value-adding, sustainability, and development that directly benefits our communities,” Minister Wong emphasized.
In conclusion, he called on APEC economies to act with unity and purpose. “The Pacific Ocean connects our economies and our futures. Let us rise to this occasion with innovation, responsibility, and shared determination to ensure our oceans remain a source of life and opportunity for generations to come.”"
"School trucks not private vehicles, says MP",1/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4227,,Education,Frustration,Nill,"Member for Kokopo Ereman ToBaining Junior has expressed concerns over the increasing number of secondary school students arriving late for classes due to transportation problems.
ToBaining Jnr stated that most secondary schools in in East New Britain Province lack proper coordination of school trucks and other vehicles needed to transport students to and from schools.
He raised the issue while commenting on a notice paper regarding the status of the Early Childhood Education Teachers College, formerly known as Bismarck Teachers College, during the April 24th provincial assembly.
He said school principals and teachers should be fair to their students.
“The trucks that the school has, are not your private vehicles to carry your families around or to only take teachers shopping,” stressed the Kokopo MP.
“Be considerate and pick up students in the morning and coordinate drop-offs in the afternoon.
“If you drive around town, you will witness many students wandering after 9am, most of them waiting for transport to get to school. Some of the affected schools include Warangoi Secondary, George Brown Secondary, and Bitapaka Secondary.”
ToBaining also highlighted the dangerous practice of students hanging onto the back of moving public vehicles.
“This is risky, and sometimes I wonder, where are all the school trucks and vehicles?”
A number of schools in the province were given vehicles by the district and provincial government, but these schools are not sufficiently assisting students with transportation.
The Kokopo MP said he had raised this matter several times during assembly sittings and called on local MPs, the Education Division, and school boards to address the issue urgently.
East New Britain Provincial Member and Chairman of the Provincial Assembly, Michael Marum, echoed similar sentiments, pointing out that many institutions were not utilising the trucks as intended."
U.S. Maritime Investments Boost PNGDF,1/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4226,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"The United States of America has officially launched two key infrastructure projects at the Lombrum Naval Base, located in Manus Province, as part of its ongoing commitment to enhancing maritime readiness for the Papua New Guinea Defense Force (PNGDF).
The $16 million investment (approximately 61 million Kina) will fund the construction of the Small Boat Team and Bosun Facility (SBBF) and the Regional Maritime Training Center (RMTC), projects that are slated for completion in April 2026.
On April 29, 2025, U.S. Ambassador to Papua New Guinea Ann Marie Yastishock, accompanied by the PNGDF leadership, provincial officials, and representatives from the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet and Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command (NAVFAC), participated in a ceremonial groundbreaking for the facilities.
These new structures will significantly expand the operational capabilities of Lombrum Naval Base, furthering the long-term security of the Indo-Pacific region.
The Small Boat Team and Bosun Facility will be designed to support PNGDF small boat operations, providing space for three small boat teams, as well as maintenance and storage for maritime equipment. This addition will greatly improve PNGDF's ability to perform coastal operations and respond to maritime threats.
The Regional Maritime Training Center will offer state-of-the-art classrooms and administrative spaces to foster continued technical proficiency and enhance training programs for PNGDF personnel. The facility is part of a broader strategy to build sustainable operational capacity within the PNGDF, ensuring that the force remains prepared for future security challenges.
This investment is a key component of the U.S.–Papua New Guinea Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA), signed in 2023. The partnership underscores USA’s commitment to strengthening defense ties with PNG, promoting regional stability, and fostering long-term collaboration.
“These projects are about more than just infrastructure,” said Ambassador Yastishock during the ceremony. “They represent trust and a shared commitment to protect the democratic values and mutual respect that define our relationship.”"
Farmers Prepare For Climate Change Effects,1/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4225,,Agriculture,Anticipation,Nill,"As extreme heatwaves and prolonged droughts devastate key agricultural regions across Africa, including staple-producing countries like Nigeria, Papua New Guinea (PNG) stands at a unique advantage with its year-round rainfall and stable tropical climate.
While farmers in Nigeria report massive crop losses due to temperatures soaring beyond 35°C, PNG’s consistent rainfall patterns and moderate temperatures present an opportunity for local growers to increase production and enter markets affected by supply shortages.
With global supply chains disrupted and African agricultural exports declining, PNG farmers are urged to scale up their output, adopt improved practices, and target regional and international markets in need of alternative suppliers.
Koren Maso from the Department of Agriculture and Livestock in a statement said, “what is a disaster for others can be a window of opportunity for PNG.”
He further stated that PNG’s natural climate is suitable for producing many of the crops now under threat globally, such as cocoa, coffee, vegetables, and rice.
There is opportunity in:
-	Exporting fresh produce to Pacific and Southeast Asian markets;
-	Expanding rice and grain production to substitute for imports affected by African shortages
-	Investing in agro-processing for high-value crops like cocoa, vanilla, and coffee
However, he said policy support is key and the National Government, through its Medium Term Development Plan IV and the National Agriculture Strategy Plan (2024–2033), is committed to enabling climate-smart agriculture, expanding access to markets, and ensuring PNG becomes a regional food hub in a changing global climate.
Mr Maso said now is the time for local farmers to think big, plant more, and connect to global value chains."

This call comes following the arrest of a young man for publishing defamatory comments against the police officers on Facebook during the long Easter weekend, where all shops were closed to observe the public holidays.
“Your voices are powerful and your online actions can shape the future of our nation. While you have the right to express your opinions and share feedback, it’s crucial to do so with respect and integrity,” Baim said.
“We welcome constructive criticism and ideas to improve our community. However, comments that spread false information, harm others reputation or promote hate are unacceptable and can result in legal consequences,” he added.

Governor Pariwa also highlighted the need for better school infrastructure, doubting the education department’s roll out of the 1-6-6 policy. This policy will enable the phasing out of Grade 8 exams, allowing students to continue to Grade 9 without examinations.
He says this is because most schools do not have the infrastructure in place to cater for the students in this new government policy initiative."
New Airstrip Lifts Sepik Communities,1/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4224,,Development,Joy,Allan Bird,"More than 19,500 people in the remote Sepik region are celebrating fresh hope and opportunity following the official opening of the rehabilitated Mariama Airstrip on the 28th of April 2025.
For 10 isolated communities in Karawari Rural LLG, East Sepik Province, the restored airstrip is a vital new lifeline — connecting them to health care, schools, and markets that once felt out of reach.
For a vanilla farmer like Daniel Wapi, the impact is personal. “Before, I had to paddle for days to sell my vanilla and get supplies. Now, planes can come. My children can get medicine quickly, and my vanilla reaches better markets,” he said, calling the airstrip ""a blessing for our people.""
Delivered through a partnership between Papua New Guinea’s Rural Airstrip Agency (RAA), the International Labour Organization (ILO), and funded by the European Union’s EU-STREIT PNG Programme, the PGK 807,671.15 rehabilitation transformed the 680-meter runway into an all-weather facility.
Upgrades included stronger surfacing, improved drainage to handle floods, and safety markers for reliable daytime landings.
The significance of the project was highlighted at the inauguration by the Governor of East Sepik Province, Allan Bird.
""My sincere thanks to RAA, DNPM, the UN system, FAO, and especially the European Union for this successful STREIT Project – the largest EU-funded project in the South Pacific for East and West Sepik. This achievement shows that large projects can yield positive results in Papua New Guinea. On behalf of the people of Greater Sepik, thank you, European Union.”
EU Ambassador Jacques Fradin emphasised that efficient transport is crucial for helping Sepik’s vanilla, cocoa, and fish products reach wider markets. Beyond infrastructure, the project created 10,000 person-days of paid work for local men and women, offering much-needed income and new skills.
With local Airstrip Maintenance Officers now trained to sustain the airstrip, families like Wapi’s say Mariama’s reopening is not just about planes landing — it’s about new possibilities taking flight."

The awards will encompass 18 categories, recognizing outstanding contributions in journalism, radio, television, print, online media, and special achievements.
MCPNG President Neville Choi emphasised the significance of reinstating the awards.
""The PNG Media Awards used to be an annual event, but it hasn’t happened probably for the past 10 years. We’ve decided to bring it back in commemoration of World Press Freedom Day on May 3rd this year.""
Choi highlighted the dedication of media personnel amidst challenges, stating that despite criticisms, there's commendable effort in the media's current operations.
He elaborated on the structure of the awards, which include five main categories - Journalism, Radio, Television, Print, and Online - alongside a Special Awards Category. Notable awards encompass 'Journalist of the Year', 'Best Investigation', 'Best Radio Show', 'TV Presenter of the Year', 'Best News Story', 'Best Website', and 'Outstanding Contribution to Media'.
The nomination period initially spanned from March 1st to March 31st but was extended.
""We extended it another two weeks because we got interest a lot outside of the mainstream media so we said yes the nominations are open to the public,"" said Choi. ""But they must be either journalists or journalistic work that have either been published or broadcast within the mainstream media membership.""
The 2025 awards serve as a trial to streamline processes and potentially expand categories in future editions. Choi mentioned the possibility of introducing awards recognizing backend technical teams in broadcasting and digital publishing.
In conjunction with the awards, the MCPNG has launched a new website,

Man arrested in Madang under Cyber Crime law,30/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4208,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"Police in Madang have arrested and charged 27-year-old Jonathan Kami from Raicoast district, under the Cyber Crime Act 2016 for allegedly publishing defamatory social media posts targeting members of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary.
He was arrested on April 24th, after police investigations identified two Facebook posts published on the “Madang Provincial News & Current Affairs” page on April 18th. These posts reportedly contained offensive and insulting remarks directed at police officers, which authorities say were fueled by frustration over the closure of shops in Madang Town during the Easter weekend.
Madang Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim, condemned the posts stating, “The posts insulted and offended police personnel in the worst possible manner. No member of the force should be subject to such public ridicule and defamatory language, especially when officers are simply enforcing lawful directives for public safety.”
Following the posts, Kami reportedly went into hiding after learning of a police raid on his family residence near Divine Word University. He later surrendered voluntarily to the National Criminal Intelligence Unit (NCIU) office, accompanied by his family and lawyer.
He is currently detained at Jomba police cells and is expected to appear for his first court hearing in Madang District Court in the coming days.
Baim emphasized the importance of responsible social media use by the public. While constructive criticism and freedom of expression are fundamental rights, citizens have been reminded that online speech must not cross the boundaries into abuse, defamation, or misinformation.
“We welcome feedback and constructive criticism; however, comments that undermine the reputation of individuals or institutions, especially through defamatory language are unacceptable and will be met with legal action.”
The PPC encouragds the community to use social media as a platform for positive engagement, dialogue and sharing of information responsibly. He also reminded citizens that laws are in place to protect individuals from harmful speech and that accountability remains a priority for law enforcement.
The Cybercrime Act 2016 provides the legal framework to address various online offenses, including cyber harassment, defamation and the spreading of false information. It underscores the importance of responsible digital behavior and the need to maintain respect and integrity in online interactions."

Hunters coach attributes win to good defence,30/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4207,,Sports,Trust,Nill,"Following Saturday’s impressive 22-14  win over Burleigh Bears in the  Round 7 clash of the Queensland Rugby League Hostplus Cup at the Santos National Football stadium Hunters coach, Paul Aiton has attributed the win to the team’s defensive scramble that kept the Bears scoreless for the entire first half.
The Hunters have been struggling with their defensive resolve in their last two away games, losing to Ipswich Jets and Mackay Cutters.
While commending the boys for impressing with their unrelenting defense and their slick attacking prowess, Coach Aiton also commended the leaders in the group for maintaining good  cohesion and control  through the middle which set the platform for the win.
Aiton however said the only downside of the win was allowing the visitors to score two late tries in the last 10 minutes.
Aiton again emphasized the importance of keeping the error counts, down and penalties which is not helping their course and how they can improve those numbers, something they always highlight at training sessions and on game day.
Looking ahead to this week’s round 8 clash against an informed Wynnum Manly side, Coach Aiton said they won’t be taking any team lightly regardless of where they are on the table.
“It’s a tough competition and yeah doesn’t matter who the opposition we play, especially when they come playing the Hunters at home. I’m sure they’ll be preparing for a big game up here and we are not taking them lightly as well. We’re taking them rather seriously.”
Prospecting on the Hunters line up for this weekend, the coach singled out Koso Bandi as the only casualty after picking up an ICL injury from last week’s clash against Bears. He will be out while Jacob Lot comes into the starting lineup.
“We got Koso Bandi he’s got ICL so we’ve had a few ICLs now. We got Benji Kot, Whallon Tauloi and now Koso, long time injuries you know.
“It’s unfortunate but it’s just the game that we play and it’s unfortunate for those boys but then it gives some of the new boys the ability to step up and take that. Because of that, now Jacob Lot got his chance to play.”
The Hunters are bracing themselves for another tough gig at home this weekend when they face the third-placed  Wynnum Manly Seagulls at 3pm Sunday at the Santos National Football stadium."

There were cheers of joy and excitement and celebration, loud applauses and enthusiastic clapping as families, spouses, children and friends of the graduating class witnessed their loved ones receive their degrees and diplomas.
In a poignant moment during today's graduation ceremony, late Sanja Willie was awarded his Bachelor of Accounting degree posthumously, honoring a life of determination and academic excellence tragically cut short.
Faculty, family, and graduates stood in a shared moment of silence and reflection, celebrating both his academic success and the enduring impact of his life, as his older cousin brother Jerry Recks, dressed in an all-black suit, walked up solemnly with a frame of Late Sanja held close to his chest to receive his younger cousin’s degree from the Chancellor of the University of Papua New Guinea, Robert Igara.
Late Sanja attained a diploma in accounting from Port Moresby Business College and enrolled at UPNG to attain his degree in accounting. He passed on the 2nd of April, 2025 and was laid to rest in Wapenamanda, Enga Province more than a week ago.
In a short tribute to commemorate late Sanja, Deputy Executive Dean, Academic, Dr Ponusammy Manohar stated that late Sanja was known for his humility, intelligence, deep faith and strong family values. He lived a life of purpose and left behind a legacy of love, perseverance and integrity, and greatly loved by his fellow graduates.
Though Sanja was not there to receive his degree in person, his legacy lives on through his accomplishments and the many lives he touched.
Cousin brother Jerry Recks said it was a long journey for Sanja to complete his studies to attain a degree, eight years in the making. He disclosed that the deceased died due to a drowning incident, describing the loss as being ‘still fresh’.
“It’s still fresh, we had to gather a lot of strength to be here on this day to receive his certificate on his behalf. I had to take the privilege and honor on behalf of the family to attend this graduation.”
Late Sanja is the first born of his parents, Recks said, “The parents could not come because they are still in mourning. The incident is just a little over three weeks ago, they are still up in the village, they couldn’t come. I can understand why, it’s quite nerve-wrecking because for myself, trying to walk up there. This was quite a whole new feeling, bittersweet in a way, we’ve achieved something for the last eight years we’ve struggled to get to this point, but sad that he’s not available, that’s the feeling that we’ll take away this moment.”
Recks spoke further about Sanja’s character, stating that Sanja would have turned 28 this year. He was single and had a whole life ahead of him.
“He (didn’t) smoke, he (didn’t) drink. He (didn’t) have this normal life of a 27-year-old. He was kind, gentle. Kept his Catholic faith close to him as well. His work was reflected through his life. He was one person that loved us all. Being the small brother in the family, he played his role very well but unfortunately this was a moment we were looking to celebrate but it is what it is and we cannot question God why, only God knows the reason why he took him. Sanja was a very humble, down to earth person and this would have been the crowning achievement of his young life heading into a good direction, one that was filled with a lot of hope but unfortunately, only God knows.”"
PMGH ICU and mortuary project launched,30/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4194,,Health,Trust,"James Marape, Justin Tkatchenko","The Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH) is set to transform its critical care capacity with the introduction of a state-of-the-art 20-bed Intensive Care Unit, alongside the long-overdue rehabilitation of the mortuary facility. This milestone project, funded by a generous grant aid of nearly K36 million from the Government of Indonesia, marks a significant leap forward in healthcare infrastructure.
Prime Minister James Marape, officiating the launch, was joined by Minister for Foreign Affairs Justin Tkatchenko, Indonesian Ambassador to Papua New Guinea, His Excellency Andriana Supandy, and esteemed members of the diplomatic corps and key government departments.
“Today, I am honored to witness the launch of this modernization—an initiative that strengthens our Intensive Care Unit and revives a much-needed mortuary facility,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
“This partnership under the PNG-Indonesia Health Program underscores our commitment to improving healthcare for both the living and those who have passed, ensuring dignity and care at every stage.”
In addition to the ICU and mortuary upgrade, the Prime Minister addressed concerns raised by Professor Dr. Glen Mola, pledging support to address the immediate need for a safe delivery environment for mothers at the maternity wing while looking forward to support long term plans of PMGH.
“While we focus on those we have lost, we must also ensure a dignified welcome for those being born. I will work with the PMGH Board, key ministers, and stakeholders to find a way forward that prioritizes maternal care,” stated Marape.
Indonesian Ambassador Andriana Supandy reaffirmed Indonesia’s unwavering support for Papua New Guinea, particularly in the realm of healthcare, as the country approaches its Independence Jubilee.
“This project has been a priority during my tenure in Port Moresby and exemplifies Indonesia’s commitment to PNG. Our government remains ready to continue assisting in health sector development in partnership with PNG authorities,” Ambassador Supandy declared.
PMGH Chief Executive Officer Dr. Paki Molumi extended gratitude to international development partners, recognizing key contributions from JICA, the governments of New Zealand Government, the United Kingdom and China, among others, in funding specialized medical facilities.
“Our mortuary, originally designed for a population of 3 million, now struggles with over 300 bodies in storage. This rehabilitation is not just a facility upgrade—it’s a commitment to providing a dignified farewell for the departed, while ensuring our hospital evolves to meet the growing needs of our people,” Dr. Molumi emphasized.
“We have a comprehensive clinical services plan and an infrastructure master plan in place to achieve the Governments objectives of delivering a Level 6 National Tertiary Referral Research and Teaching Hospital, therefore all Infrastructure developments must be in line with these plans. The Mortuary and ICU modernization are in line with our plans.”
“As discussions continue, the Government of Papua New Guinea remains steadfast in its mission to strengthen healthcare systems, ensuring every individual—whether seeking life-saving treatment or receiving a respectful farewell—is cared for with dignity and compassion.”
The mortuary design will consist of, not only storage for deceased, but also an embalming facility, forensic medicine department, funeral services and a chapel among others.
The project was launched on Monday, 28 April, 2025."

"Dibu Primary receives K50, 000",30/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4196,,Local,Joy,Ramsey Pariwa,"The remote Dibu Primary School, situated on the bank of the mighty Ramu river in Ward Nine of Arabaka Local Level Government (LLG) area in the Middle-Ramu district of Madang province was recognized recently with the presentation of a K50,000 cheque by the Madang Provincial Government.
People from Dibu-Watabu and the neighboring villagers who dwell along the Ramu river banks converged on the grounds of Dibu primary school to welcome Governor Pariwa and his delegation from Madang who were there last week to do this presentation.
The presentation of this funding assistance is a result of a commitment made by the governor, Ramsey Pariwa during one of his visits to Watabu last year to assist the new school that was established in 2022.
Governor Pariwa also admitted that during his campaign trail in 2017 and 2022, he had walked the jungles along the banks of the Ramu River and had rested overnight at Watabu and knows the hardships faced by the people in that corner of Madang province.
Dibu Primary School board chairman, Steven Soma expressed his thanks to Governor Pariwa for honoring his verbal commitment by returning to the school and presenting the money.
The Watabu-Dibu people of Arabaka LLG in Middle-Ramu district are cut off from the rest of Madang. They travel by motor boats from their villages following the Ramu river upstream to Banu boat-stop in Usino-Bundi district where they catch PMV trucks to go into Madang town to do business.
There is no road link to most of the big villages in Arabaka LLG of Middle-Ramu. People pay K100 as boat fare to travel to Banu in Usino Bundi district then spend another K100 on PMVs to travel by road to Madang.
Governor Pariwa also used the occasion to explain announce the allocation of K6 million for road works to commence."
Gerehu Hospital temporarily closed,29/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4189,,Health,Fear,Nill,"Gerehu General Hospital in NCD has been forced to temporarily close due to severe flooding following heavy rainfall over the weekend.

Prime Minister summons health officials,29/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4178,,Health,Anticipation,Elias Kapavore,"Health Minister Elias Kapavore and other health officials have been summoned by the Prime Minister to a meeting on Friday, May 02nd 2025 to address issues raised by the country’s leading gynecologist, Dr Glen Mola.
Last week, Dr Mola raised concerns of mothers giving birth on the floor of  Port Moresby General Hospital’s maternity wing and how a Japanese aid project would have eased this burden years ago.
This came to the attention of the Prime Minister who has now intervened to address delays in a Japanese Government grant aid project to upgrade the maternity wing at Port Moresby General Hospital.
“I am aware that the Japanese Government offered to fund the refurbishment of the maternity wing,” Prime Minister Marape said. “Unfortunately, there have been delays because the hospital management did not confirm acceptance of the project.”
He acknowledged Dr Glen Mola, who raised the matter publicly, and said: “There is no reason to doubt Dr Mola, who has devoted his professional life to this field. If he says there is a crisis, authorities must act immediately and plan for the future.”
Prime Minister Marape stressed that the hospital, built for a city of under 200,000, now struggles to meet the needs of a population nearing one million.
He emphasised urgent short-term interventions and reaffirmed broader plans, including suburban hospitals and a new National Capital hospital in partnership with the NCD and development partners.
“I have summoned the Secretary for Health, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Port Moresby General Hospital CEO Dr Paki Molumi, Dr Glen Mola, and all involved to a meeting on Friday, 2 May 2025, to resolve this matter,” Prime Minister Marape announced.

Law school graduates 188 students,29/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4181,,Education,Trust,Nill,"""Go spend your time in provinces and serve our people"", was the message to the graduates of the UPNG School of Law during the 70th graduation ceremony this morning at the Sir John Guise stadium.

LDC aims to clear Lae land,29/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4187,,Government,Anger,Nill,"The Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) aims to reclaim State land at Three-Mile, Lae, starting with Portion 234.
This follows years of illegal occupation and dubious title transfers.
After visiting the affected land recently, LDC Managing Director, Terry Koim, said the facts were indisputable and the time to act was now.
“A government minute dated 14th February 1989 clearly shows that the National Housing Corporation (NHC) applied only for the southern part of Portion 234; not the whole of Portions 224, 225, and 234. Despite this, the Land Board mistakenly recommended the lease over all three portions. This was never intended. It was wrong then, and it is wrong now.”
Koim highlighted that the Department of Primary Industry (now Department of Agriculture) held a Certificate of Occupancy over the northern part of Portion 234 and intended to release 63.6 hectares to LDC for agricultural development, not for housing or illegal human settlement.
“The northern part of Portion 234, and likely parts of 224 and 225, were never lawfully meant for private housing. They were earmarked for agriculture, specifically Portion 234, which was intended for LDC.”
Koim said LDC’s actions were based firmly on government records and historical intent.
“We are not engaging in guesswork or social media theatrics. We are acting on facts, on lawful processes, and on the responsibility we carry as a national institution.”
“The eviction of illegal settlers, starting with Portion 234, is not just lawful; it is a moral obligation.
“If we fail to act, we betray future generations and the development vision intended for this land.”
Responding to critics, Koim challenged their silence over past injustices.
“Where were you when settlers forcibly removed NAQIA and the former DAL officers from this land?
“Where were your voices when public property was illegally occupied and misused?
“It is easy to criticise after the damage has been done. It is harder to stand up and put things right.
“We are not doing this for social media approval or headlines.
“We are doing this because this land belongs to the people of Papua New Guinea.
“It must be restored to its rightful purpose — to strengthen food security, economic independence, and national development.”
As Papua New Guinea marks its 50th year of independence, Koim said reclaiming State land is critical to safeguarding the country’s future through agriculture.
“At 50 years, we must have the courage to correct the mistakes of the past. As Prime Minister Marape once asked: ‘If not now, then when? If not us, then who?’ The time to act is now.
“We owe it to the next generation to reclaim, rebuild, and redevelop what is rightfully ours.”"
Election of new Pope to begin on May 7th,29/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4175,,Religion,Anticipation,Nill,"The conclave to elect the 267th Pope will begin on May 7th, following the conclusion of the Novemdiales Masses to pray for the eternal repose of the late Pope Francis.
Vatican News reports that the Cardinals present in Rome have agreed to begin the conclave on May 7th, 2025.
The date was set on Monday morning by the approximately 180 cardinals present (just over a hundred of whom are electors) gathered for the fifth General Congregation in the Vatican.
The conclave will take place in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel, which will remain closed to visitors during those days. There is no set time frame for the conclave to sit. It continues until a new Pope is elected.
What happens during the conclave?
The conclave will be preceded by a solemn Eucharistic celebration with the votive Mass Pro Eligendo Papa, attended by the Cardinal electors. It is a specific Mass celebrated before a papal conclave. It serves as a prelude to the election of a new Pope, with Cardinal electors attending. This Mass seeks divine guidance for the electors and sets a reverent tone for the subsequent proceedings in the Sistine Chapel.
In the afternoon, the Cardinal electors proceed in a solemn procession to the Sistine Chapel, where the Conclave begins to elect the new Pope.
At the end of the procession inside the Sistine Chapel, each Cardinal elector takes the oath as prescribed in paragraph 53 of Universi Dominici Gregis.
Through this oath, they commit, if elected, to faithfully fulfill the Munus Petrinum as Pastor of the Universal Church.
They also pledge to maintain absolute secrecy regarding everything related to the election of the Roman Pontiff and to refrain from supporting any attempts of external interference in the election.
At this point, the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations proclaims extra omnes, meaning that all individuals who are not part of the Conclave must leave the Sistine Chapel.
Only the Master himself and the ecclesiastic designated to deliver the second meditation remain.
This meditation focuses on the grave responsibility that rests upon the electors and the necessity of acting with pure intentions for the good of the Universal Church, keeping only God before their eyes.
Once the meditation is delivered, both the ecclesiastic and the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations leave.
The Cardinal electors then recite prayers according to the Ordo Sacrorum Rituum Conclavis and listen to the Cardinal Dean, who asks whether they are ready to proceed with voting or if any clarifications regarding the rules and procedures.
All election procedures take place exclusively in the Sistine Chapel within the Vatican Apostolic Palace, which remains completely sealed off until the election is concluded.
Throughout the election process, the Cardinal electors must refrain from sending letters or engaging in conversations, including phone calls, except in cases of extreme urgency.
They are not allowed to send or receive messages of any kind, receive newspapers or magazines of any nature, or follow radio or television broadcasts.
How many votes are required to elect a Pope?
To validly elect a new Pope, a two-thirds majority of the electors present is required.
If the total number of electors is not evenly divisible by three, an additional vote is necessary.
If voting begins on the afternoon of the first day, there will be only one ballot. On subsequent days, two ballots are held in the morning and two in the afternoon.
After the votes are counted, all ballots are burned. If the ballot was inconclusive, a chimney positioned over the Sistine Chapel emits black smoke. If a Pope is elected, white smoke will billow out of the chimney.
If the electors fail to reach an agreement on a candidate after three days of inconclusive voting, a break of up to one day is allowed for prayer, free discussion among voters, and a brief spiritual exhortation by the Cardinal Proto-Deacon (Cardinal Dominique Mamberti).
What happens immediately after a new Pope is elected?
Once the Cardinals have elected a new Pope, the last of the Cardinal Deacons calls the Secretary of the College of Cardinals and the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations into the Sistine Chapel.
The Dean of the College, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, speaking on behalf of all the electors, asks for the elected candidate’s consent with the following words: “Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?”
Upon receiving consent, he then asks: “What name do you wish to be called?”
The functions of a notary, with two Ceremonial Officers as witnesses, are carried out by the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations, who drafts the document of acceptance and records the chosen name.
From this moment, the newly-elected Pope acquires full and supreme authority over the universal Church. The Conclave ends immediately at this point.
The Cardinal electors then pay homage and pledge obedience to the new Pope, and thanks are given to God.
The Cardinal Proto-Deacon then announces to the faithful the election and the name of the new Pontiff with the famous line: “Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum; Habemus Papam,” meaning  “I announce to you a great joy; we have a pope.”
Immediately afterward, the new Pope gives the Apostolic Blessing Urbi et Orbi from the Loggia of St. Peter’s Basilica.
The final step required is that, after the solemn inauguration ceremony of the Pontificate and within a suitable time, the new Pope formally takes possession of the Patriarchal Archbasilica of St. John Lateran."

Tragic Landslide in EHP Claims Lives,28/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4173,,Disaster,Sadness,Nill,"A deadly landslide triggered by days of relentless rainfall has claimed the lives of a mother and her four children in Apogga village, in Gahuku Rural LLG, Eastern Highlands Province.
The tragic incident occurred around 3:00 am on Sunday, as the family slept. According to local reports, continuous heavy rain throughout the past week caused widespread flooding across Goroka township, blocking drainage systems and overflowing into streets, settlements, suburbs, and residential areas.
The victims include a young mother, believed to be in her late 30s, her 15-year-old daughter, her seven-year-old daughter, and a two-year-old baby girl. Their names have not yet been officially released.
The father of the family was away, attending an overnight church service, and was unable to return due to the bad weather.
The family’s 12-year-old son survived by digging himself out from under the debris and raising the alarm within the village in the dark early hours. Youths nearby heard the loud noise from the landslide and rushed to the scene, but were unable to render assistance as the house was completely buried.
At daybreak, community members and village leaders recovered the five bodies and transported them to the Goroka Provincial Hospital morgue.
Authorities are warning residents across Eastern Highlands Province to remain on high alert, as further heavy rainfall is expected this week."
Dormant film industry,27/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4163,,Arts,Concern,Nill,"One of the country's first Cinematographers, Rabura Aiga, is encouraging the rightful authorities to take charge and develop the so-called ‘dormant’ film industry.
Legendary Rabura Aiga, who sat with this news team yesterday, expressed concern about the country's lack of a film industry, unlike other countries that have thriving film industries.
“Sadly, we don’t have a film industry. Like in the Philippines, they have a film industry; people produce films from private companies and sell them to TV stations to run. We do not have that; we also don’t have a pool of talents, where you can hire them to create movies, soap operas, commercials, and more.”
He suggested establishing a film association to produce documentaries and soap operas by local filmmakers. This association will promote the appreciation and advancement of film through screenings, education, and advocacy.
“We do not have a film industry because there is no market for it. We also should create a film association and produce quality documentaries, soap operas, movies and more. We Papua New Guineans have so much to give.”
Aiga is encouraging young people to join the industry, adding that modern equipment has made life easier.
“Now that filming equipment is easy to use, anyone can get a camera and take photographs and videos. But we need specialists to train so we can produce quality. The production quality has dropped.”"
Vipers Academy Player settles well in UK,27/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4164,,Sports,Joy,Powes Parkop,"Junior Bini Kaeaka, the first Port Moresby Vipers Academy player sent abroad, has settled in well with Hull Kingston Rovers Rugby League Club in England.
The promising rugby league talent has begun classes and joined training with his new teammates at the club’s academy. Thanks to the partnership between Port Moresby Vipers and Hull Kingston Rovers rugby league clubs.
Vice Chairman of the Port Moresby Vipers, Tony Sipa, who facilitated Kaeaka’s move, said the Hull Kingston Rovers have welcomed Kaeaka with open arms, and so was his school, Hymers College. Sipa said the school has designed special courses to help Kaeaka catch up with the rest of the students, and he found himself comfortable in the new learning environment.
Sipa said Junior met up with his classmates, teachers and spent a week with him to make sure he was okay and settled well in school.
“After enrolling him at school, I took Kaeaka to the Club (Hull KR) the next day. They were grateful and welcomed him. The same day, he did his medical checks and admitted him to the team. We didn’t waste time, the first day he enrolled at the school, and the next day he joined the club.”
The Vipers' vice chairman has connected Kaeaka with several PNG Internationals based in the UK, including PNG Kumuls legend Rhyse Martin and Watson Boas. Sipa says those connections would boost Junior’s confidence and make him feel at home.
Kaeaka is staying with former Kumuls and Hull KR legend John Okul where Okul will be playing a mentor role in guiding the young man in his rugby league journey. Sipa said Okul can take Kaeaka through extra training and diet to ensure Kaeaka gets the best out of this opportunity.
Sipa hailed the move as a breakthrough for Rugby League in PNG. He said this is the ongoing partnership between the Vipers and Hull Kingston Rovers and revealed plans to send more players later this year.
Sipa said, “It’s a big breakthrough for both Vipers and Hull RK. I think in PNG, we don’t have local clubs sending their juniors to sign a contract in Australia’s Rugby League or the Super League. To send our talent to a big club like Hull KR is a big honor for us, Vipers, and the players coming through our academy program.”
He admitted that the program requires substantial financial support and urged corporate entities to support. When urging for corporate support, Sipa thanked the NCD Governor, Powes Parkop, Moni Plus, British High Commission to PNG, Hull Kingston Rovers, Vipers Academy staff, and the corporate sponsors who helped make the move possible."

Reconstructive surgeries restore hope in East Sepik,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4152,,Health,Joy,Nill,"Twenty-five people from East Sepik have opened a new chapter of their lives, thanks to a life-changing collaboration between Frieda River Limited (FRL) and Interplast Australia New Zealand.
From 31 March to 5 April, Wewak’s Boram Hospital became the beacon of hope, as a team of volunteer specialists performed 29 free and delicate reconstructive procedures on the 25 men, women, and children with conditions ranging from congenital deformities like cleft lips to debilitating injuries caused by burns and bush knife traumas.
The surgical team, a multidisciplinary force of compassion and skill, included two surgeons, a trainee surgeon from Papua New Guinea (PNG), two anaesthetists, six physiotherapists, and perioperative nurses from both Australia and Boram Hospital.
Sponsored by FRL – the proponent of the Frieda River copper-gold project in remote Sepik – this initiative marked the second year of a three-year partnership, with this year’s mission seeing an increase in procedures compared to 2024.
“We successfully conducted 29 procedures on 25 patients – 12 more than last year,” said team leader Dr Sid Karanth, who also revealed a sobering detail – that nearly 90% of the injuries treated stemmed from preventable bush knife attacks and burns.
One of the patients, 17-year-old Joyce Koko, had lived with painful scars since childhood when an accident near her mother’s cooking fire left her with severe burns. Boiling oil splashed across her neck, jaw, and right cheek, leaving her with a disfigured skin. The day after the surgery, Joyce spoke softly but with resolve.
“Thank you to the doctors. I will return to school and try to live a normal life again. I want to finish school and become a nurse so I can help others.”
FRL Country Manager, Joel Hamago thanked the visiting specialists from Australia who had given their time to this volunteer mission.
“Reconstructive surgery is a costly procedure, far beyond the reach of ordinary Papua New Guineans. That is why the FRL Sepik Interplast program exists – bringing in volunteer specialists from Australia to lead these life-changing surgeries free of charge,” he said.
With the FRL Sepik Interplast partnership continuing into 2026, more lives are set to be transformed – but the deeper call remains: healing not just bodies, but communities."

From his Bereina District Office, Member for Kairuku Peter Namea Isoaimo conveyed heartfelt condolences on behalf of the electorate’s Catholic faithful.
In his statement, Isoaimo acknowledged the Pope’s profound spiritual influence and global leadership, expressing both sorrow and respect for the role the late Pope played in guiding millions around the world, including in PNG.

Expatriate arrested and charged under the ‘Lukautim Pikinini Act’,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4153,,Crime,Disgust,Nill,"A 50-year-old Chinese national and supermarket proprietor in Madang, Jack Wengs (also known by his Chinese name Yugui Weng), has been formally charged with two counts of child abuse involving his five-year-old biological son, Brian Weng. The charges follow a report made by the child’s mother, Sila Bilik, a Papua New Guinean national from Kubam village, Karkar Island, who raised concerns about Weng’s failure to fulfil his responsibilities as a parent.
Provincial Police Commander of Madang, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim emphasized that the situation involves serious concerns about the welfare and rights of the child, highlighting the exploitive nature of the relationship between Wengs and Bilik, which resulted in the birth of the child in August 2019.
Wengs owned and operated Prouds Mart, a well-known supermarket located in Madang’s central business district. His relationship with Ms. Bilik began between 2017 and 2018, during which time she worked at his supermarket. Despite initially denying paternity, Wengs eventually acknowledged the child and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Bilik at Coastwatchers Hotel, agreeing to provide a monthly family support budget of K6, 000. This support was intended to cover rent, educational expenses, food and medical costs.
Nevertheless, police allege Wengs failed to meet his financial obligations as outlined in the MOU, prompting Ms. Bilik to report the matter to the Family and Sexual Violence Unit (FSVU) at Jomba Police Station on March 13th, 2025. This led to a coordinated police operation involving the Madang Transnational Crimes Unit, the National Criminal Intelligence Unit and the PNG Immigration and Citizenship Authority.
On April 23rd, 2025 Wengs was arrested at the FSVU office in Madang around 3:49pm. His passport and visa documents were confiscated by immigration officials from Lae’s Momase Regional Office to facilitate further investigations into his immigration status. Wengs has been charged under the Lukautim Pikinini Act 2009 with two criminal offenses:
Failure to provide adequate support to his biological son. (Section 132)
Engaging in conduct likely to harm the child’s intellectual development. (Section 133(a)(b))
He was released on a police bail of K4, 000 with K2, 000 paid for each charge. This case is now a matter of the Madang District Court while immigration authorities will contiue their assessment of Weng’s immigration status in light of the criminal allegations.
PPC Baim emphasized the message this case sends to foreign nationals involved with PNG citizens, especially concerning the welfare of children. He stressed that foreign nationals must fulfil their legal responsibilities or face prosecution under PNG law.
The case highlights the importance of protecting children’s rights and ensuring that all parents, regardless of nationality, adhere to their legal and moral obligations to support and care for their children."
NCDPHA commemorates World Malaria Day,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4151,,Health,Anticipation,Nill,"The National Capital District Provincial Health Authority (NCDPHA) joined the global community in commemorating World Malaria Day yesterday, with a dedicated event held at Evedahana Primary School under the theme “End Malaria in NCD”.
Malaria, one of the world’s oldest and deadliest diseases, remains a serious public health threat in Papua New Guinea. The day was aimed at raising awareness, promote prevention, and encourage early treatment to eliminate malaria in the National Capital District.
World Malaria Day, marked annually on 25 April, was instituted by WHO Member States during the World Health Assembly of 2007. It is an occasion to highlight the need for continued investment and sustained political commitment for malaria prevention and control.
Dr. James Kelly, Regional Malaria Technical Officer with the World Health Organization (WHO), led a live demonstration and emphasized the crucial role individuals play in ending malaria.
“Malaria should end with us. Everyone must avoid stagnant water, sleep under a mosquito net, and get tested if they experience fever, headaches, or joint pains,” said Dr. Kelly.
Dr. Maria Ome, Head of the Vector Borne Unit at the PNG Institute of Medical Research, highlighted the dangers of untreated malaria, particularly for vulnerable groups.
“Malaria spreads through mosquito bites, especially when infected individuals do not receive proper treatment. Pregnant mothers must seek medical care to protect both themselves and their unborn babies. Complete the full course of prescribed malaria medication to help keep your household malaria-free,” she advised.
Dr. Amos Lano, Director for Public Health at NCDPHA, reinforced the importance of timely medical attention.
“Anyone showing symptoms of malaria should immediately seek help at the nearest health facility in NCD,” he urged.
Addressing students at the event, Dr. Lano encouraged them to report symptoms promptly to their teachers and seek proper treatment. He also acknowledged the continued support of Rotary Against Malaria (RAM) and the National Department of Health (NDoH) in the fight against malaria.
“As part of our ongoing efforts, a first aid post will be established on the school grounds to monitor and manage malaria cases among students and staff,” Dr. Lano announced."
Independence as seen through Aiga’s lens,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4157,,Media,Sadness,Nill,"As PNG celebrates its 50th Independence Anniversary, Papua New Guinea’s pioneer Cinematographer and the last colonially-trained cameraman in the country speaks about the evolution of media in the country.
The legendary Rabura Aiga who hails from Vabukori village in the Moresby South electorate of Port Moresby, began his career in 1974 with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, when he moved into the Department of Information and Extension Services as an Assistant Cameraman, and later promoted to Chief Cameraman in 1975, a perfect independence gift.
Later in 1986, he became a Sales consultant at Chin H Meen & Sons, then as Chief Cameraman and Producer/Director at NTN Television in 1987. He also started his own Film Production Company with Frank Mills & Associate in 1989. He holds these experiences close to heart and now shares how the media has evolved as PNG prepares to welcome the 50th anniversary sunrise this September.
“I felt like it was the right place and time to be a cinematographer. I applied when the position was advertised and they got me. I didn’t know what I was going into, because it was new in PNG, but I thank God that it was probably divine intervention that I became a cameraman. “
Mr Aiga recalled many highlights in his media career, notably his participation and experience with Hollywood for the production of Robinson Crusoe. Yumi yet, Fourth Child, Marape, and Papua Besena Demonstration are among many other productions he was proud to have been part of. One he recalls clearly is the raising of the PNG flag in 1975, in Milne Bay’s provincial capital, Alotau, which he was assigned to capture.
“So I was part of the Yumi Yet film and you’ll see the footage we took there. I was part of the team to capture the flag raising ceremony in 1975 in Alotau. But looking back, it was mixed feelings, people were excited and not sure of what could happen when the Australian Government left.”
Through his lenses, Mr Aiga believes PNG was not ready enough for self-governance and explains why.
“The question on peoples’ minds are, were we ready or not? Looking back at the developments after the Independence, I think PNG was a bit too early, we were not ready and the Australian Government did not really prepare us enough before handing over a lot of things like the schools’ infrastructure and systems fell apart.”
One of the things that stand out for Mr Aiga is the difference in the level of education then and today. He strongly believes in the power of proper training and mentorship to increase work quality anywhere and everywhere.
“I went to KilaKila Secondary school when Independence came. The expatriates left and locals had to take over, there was not a proper transition or teachers were not taught to the fullest. After the transition there was not much money to improve infrastructure and the classes started deteriorating over time.”"
Baiyer landowners encouraged to prepare for future gains,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4150,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"Landowners of the Baiyer Cattle Ranch in Western Highlands Province  have been advised to immediately register a Landowner company to maximize benefits once the cattle ranch comes into full operation.
Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) Managing Director, Terry Koim had an audience with a few landowners and settlers at Baiyer Police Station to outline LDC’s plans to revive the ranch.
“Landowners need to come together and register a company, so they become shareholders to any investment on the 4000 hectors of land.
“LDC is just a custodian of the land. We want to create generational wealth for the landowners whose land is where the Baiyer Cattle Ranch sits on,” said Koim.
Baiyer Cattle Ranch is in the Mul Baiyer electorate of Western Highlands Province.
It is a colonial property handed over to the Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) in 1982 when LDC was established.
Mismanagement and lack of good governance eventually ran the ranch down in 1992.
Today, a bulldozer is already on site with eviction notices already served to the settlers in late February this year.
“Like all other LDC properties throughout the country, we are taking back Baiyer Cattle Ranch.
“There is no need to discuss land title issues. The land belongs to LDC.
“The land was given to the Government for cattle grazing during the colonial time and then handed over to LDC in 1982, but LDC management at that time shattered the hopes of the landowners’ forefathers.
“That dream is now going to happen and LDC will make it happen,” Koim said.
With settlers moving out of the ranch, work has now commenced to build proper access roads in the valley. Fencing of the property should commence in May.
Mr Koim said by December 2025, cattle should be grazing on the once abandoned Baiyer River Cattle Ranch.
“I urge the people of Baiyer Valley to work with us and help us deliver this project in our collective interest for a better future. It's revitalization is aligned to the government's MTDP 4 2023 - 2027 policy under the National Livestock Development Program.
“This will create more economic empowerment for the people of Baiyer and their children and contribute towards the overall import replacement and food security policies of government."

Kokoda porter shares history,24/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4129,,Local,Trust,Nill,"To mark the country’s 50th Independence anniversary, local porter of the Kokoda Track, Gibson Muri, spoke of his experience as a guide for the last 22 years.
He spoke of the pride he holds as a Papua New Guinean, honoring his ancestors, running parallel with the fight for Independence.
The Kokoda Track and Papua New Guinea’s Independence are deeply rooted in the shared history between Papua New Guinea and Australia.
Since 2003, local porter and guide for the Kokoda track, Gibson spoke of his experience and how his chieftaincy goes far back to when his grandfather was one of the ‘Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels’ who became a chief of their community along the blue mountains of the Kokoda Track.
“My grandfather used to carry the food supply for the Australian soldiers and sometimes the wounded soldiers in World War II in 1942. He then went on to work with them to navigate locations along the Kokoda Track. In 1975, when PNG gained Independence, my grandfather returned home to Manari village and became the chief.
“My Dad was born, and after that I came into this world, I made sure to follow my grandfathers’ footsteps and went back to the community and continued the journey of becoming a porter and carrier for trackers, this way I am in a way helping and supporting my family and community.”
Muri expressed pride when tracing his ancestors and relatives who were part of the carriers for the food supply and wounded Australian soldiers during World War II in 1942.
“Every time I walk the Kokoda and when I go through the pain and struggle, I think back to the time when my ancestors walked, it gives me pride. I will always respect this history and since Anzac is coming up, I’ll pay my respects and show appreciation to the ancestors.”
Now, Muri, who has partnered to create his own business called TruWarrior, is sharing the country’s special history, encouraging them to do better for the country in the coming years.
“I put my children to school and encourage them to be great men and women of this nation, so they can do better for our community. My only appeal is to seek attention for the porters and guides of the Kokoda Track. We’d like more recognition in terms of our salary, I feel that the pain we go through every walk does not correspond with the salary we are given to cater for our children.”"

FIJI 7’s team officials voice discontent,24/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4121,,Sports,Anger,Nill,"Officials from the visiting Fijian 7s team, Devo Babas, have expressed serious concerns regarding unsportsmanlike tactics encountered during the recently held Niupower Sportstok 7s tournament in Port Moresby.
Team Manager Salacieli Tabalailai who acknowledged the physicality and aggression inherent in PNG rugby, voiced his dissatisfaction with several officiating decisions, particularly concerning dangerous tackles and rough tactics aimed at injuring his players. He noted that match officials only issued yellow cards for actions that warranted red cards, raising concerns about player safety and the integrity of the tournament. He reported that three of his players suffered serious injuries due to rough play, necessitating their removal from the field.
""There’s a need for the upskilling of officials, especially referees and touch judges,"" Tabalailai stated. ""The safety and well-being of players are in their hands. We witnessed numerous decisions that were questionable, and there is a pressing need for improvement in officiating standards.""
He emphasized that while rugby is a contact sport, players must be protected by the rules and the code of ethics governing safe play. He expressed disappointment with the handling of injuries and the overall management of the game by officials, asserting that a significant portion of the calls—approximately 70%—were biased against his team.
Tournament manager Benson Upas acknowledged the concerns raised by Devo Babas officials and committed to discussing them with the head of technical officials. He recognized the need for improvement in the technical aspects of the tournament, particularly in the training and upskilling of referees and match officials.
""We need to ensure that our officials are well-prepared and capable of making the right calls,"" Upas stated. ""Bringing international teams to participate in our tournament is crucial, and we must avoid mistakes by our officials to ensure quality games.""
Upas highlighted specific incidents during the tournament where players should have received red cards but were only given yellow cards, suggesting that stricter enforcement could enhance the standard of play. He reiterated the importance of educating coaches, team managers, players, and supporters about proper skills, techniques, and the rules of the game.
Both Tabalailai and Upas agreed that improving the quality of refereeing is essential for attracting more sponsors and overseas teams in the future, ultimately contributing to the growth of rugby in Papua New Guinea. They emphasized the collective responsibility of all stakeholders to elevate the standard of the game and ensure a safe and fair playing environment."

Prime Minister Signals Tough Times Ahead for Citizens,23/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4099,,Business,Fear,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has warned Papua New Guineans to brace for hard times ahead as the tariff hikes by the United States takes effect globally.
Marape said PNG will not be immune from the ripple effects of global economic shocks stemming from these tariff hikes, and has urged the country to remain vigilant as his government monitors and manages the situation.
“This is a time for our people to understand that there are strong global economic headwinds ahead,” he said.
“We must prepare for the possibility of price increases, supply chain disruptions, and investment slowdowns. But we also want to assure the country that we are managing our economy prudently and are focused on our national budget priorities.”
Prime Minister Marape said the sweeping tariff increases imposed by the United States on China and other key global economies represent a “tectonic shift in global trade and commerce” that will inevitably have downstream consequences for small, import-dependent nations like Papua New Guinea.
“These are not minor trade adjustments,” the Prime Minister stressed. “This is a major global event.
When the world’s number one economy imposes tariffs of over 200 per cent on the number two economy as well as all other economies, the entire global trading system is shaken.
While we do not have a significant trade relationship with the United States, we are closely integrated with China, Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, Europe, and Australia— economies that are directly impacted.”
Prime Minister Marape said PNG’s Treasury Department, the Central Bank, and his own department are closely monitoring the situation and assessing the potential economic risks, particularly with regard to inflation and the rising cost of goods and services.
The Prime Minister acknowledged that some impacts may be unavoidable in the short term, but expressed confidence in the medium-to-long-term outlook, citing over US$40 billion worth of resource projects in the pipeline.
“In the next 10 years, we expect nearly $40 billion in foreign direct investments into our country through projects such as Papua LNG, Pasca A, P’nyang LNG, Wafi-Golpu, and potential progress on Frieda River and the Wildebeest LNG in Gulf and Maliu Oil in Central provinces,” he stated.
“These are real projects, with real partners. Pasca and P’nyang are already signed, and Papua LNG is progressing with TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil. Porgera is operating now and we shall close a better project agreement for Wafi-Golpu soon. These developments will underpin our economy for the next two decades and secure long-term economic stability.”
Prime Minister Marape also noted that while global conditions are beyond PNG’s control, the government is staying the course on fiscal consolidation.
He added that the 2024 Final Budget Outcome will be released and will show our financial management in 2024 amidst difficult global conditions.
“Unlike many peer economies struggling to attract capital, we have the largest multinationals operating here. Our job is to keep investor confidence high and ensure policy consistency. I am optimistic that despite the challenges of today, the future of Papua New Guinea remains bright,” he said."

Vice Admiral Jones said this is the first time in 11 iterations, or 22 years of Exercise Talisman Sabre, that part of its activity is hosted outside of Australia.
He outlined that this is indicative of the long relationship Australia has with PNG, especially when the country is nearing its 50th Independence anniversary.

‘Go out and be productive’,22/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4085,,Nation,Anticipation,Nill,"Imagine the state of this country if it had productive citizens.
Chancellor of the PNG University of Technology, Sam Koim, emphasised the word “productive” when speaking to graduands at the recent 57th graduation ceremony in Lae, Morobe Province.
He issued the reminder that graduating students are the living product of many productive investments.
“You are the product of all who contributed to the making of you and now go and be productive with the power of knowledge you have acquired,” Koim said.
“In the early days of Singapore’s development, its founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew rallied all his citizens and their aspirations around one word – productivity. That one word transformed a small, resource-limited island into a global economic powerhouse.
“Today, in Papua New Guinea, the Government is spending over K7 billion on public servants’ salary alone in the 2025 budget. The challenge before us is this: Are we getting K7 billion worth of productivity in return from the public servants? It’s anybody’s guess.
“Imagine where Papua New Guinea will be and the kind of service our people would be receiving today, if all the public servants had been productive at their workplace.
“So, I encourage you graduates to go out and be productive to make a difference. No matter where you find yourself – public or private sector, employed or still finding your path – choose to be productive.
“We live in an era of unprecedented productivity tools. Generative AI, tools like ChatGPT, digital platforms – these can make you smarter, faster, more effective. They can multiply your impact – if you know how to use them wisely and ethically.
“If you don’t find your dream job, you can still be at home and be productive. Use your phone to utilise some of these digital tools to be productive.
“Remember, your education is just 10 percent of your success. The other 90 percent is effort, determination, resilience – what I call perspiration. It’s not your degree that will define you, but what you do with it.
“You may stumble. You may fail. But rise again. Continue to aspire. Continue to perspire. And above all – be productive.
“Go out and shape our nation with your productivity.”"
Wau roadworks progress,22/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4091,,Infrastructure,Anticipation,Nill,"Realignment and rehabilitation work has started on the Wau town road to Pinetop in the new Wau-Waria district of Morobe Province.
Last week, the contractor, Well Burst Engineering, started the cleaning and widening of the road from the Wau Signboard to the Katherine Lehmann School’s sharp bend.
Work has commenced after the groundbreaking ceremony by Wau-Waria MP, Marsh Narewec, in front of the district office on Monday, April 7th.
Well Burst Engineering managing director, Danny Kati, was present during the ceremony and immediately assembled his equipment and workers to start work on the road.
The other contract was awarded to a local contractor, Izi Gnaebuk Contractors, to carry out maintenance work from Wau to Nemnem in Wau Rural LLG.
Its managing director, Yosi Mambu, also mobilised all his equipment and workers and commenced with maintenance work last week.
The contractors took the long weekend off, and will resume this week.
A government team, comprising of Wau Rural LLG officer, Samuel Sesigouc, conducted awareness along the road to Four Road, Mrs Booth, Yanga top and Pinetop, informing residents about the new road works.
“We carried out awareness on the new road that would be built to Pinetop and told them that the realignment and rehabilitation work has started from Wau town and will pass through their area to connect with Pinetop this year,” Sesigouc explained.
There is no proper road connecting Wau and Pinetop, as the old road had been closed due to alluvial mining activities at the top of Yangalimu mountain.
Motorists are using the PNG Forest Products road, known as “Jinker Road”, which was mainly used to transport round logs from the plantations to the plymill in Bulolo for nearly 15 years.
The 2km winding road takes over one hour to reach Bulolo from Wau.
Local MP, Narewec, had made the commitment to build a new road that would take less travel time.
He alluded that after two-and-a-half years in office, he has managed to secure funding for the new road."
PMGH CEO responds,22/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4093,,Health,Sadness,Nill,"Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH) Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Paki Molumi has responded in a media statement, to concerns raised by Professor Glen Mola over the Easter weekend regarding the dire state of the hospital’s labour ward on social media.
Reflecting on the status of the ward while serving mothers in labour over 72 hours during the Easter Weekend, Professor Mola expressed grave concern on the overloading of patients, mothers giving birth with insufficient birthing facilities, space and manpower.
He referred to his own experience at the Maternity wing, where many women giving birth exceeded the number of beds available in the labour ward, forcing several mothers to give birth on the floor.
Dr. Molumi acknowledged the overload and said it is a common issue in several wards, including the emergency department, labour ward, outpatient clinics, radiology and pathology services.
However, he explained that PMGH is dealing with the challenge of providing primary and secondary health care for a rapidly growing population, not just in NCD but in the surrounding Gulf and Central provinces.
Dr Molumi said the delays in the establishment of Level 5 and Level 4 hospital facilities and staffing are compounding this challenge.
PMGH is at the same time is transitioning to become the Level 6 national tertiary referral, research, and teaching hospital, consistent with government policy. It has been making good strides on specialist services in cardiac, cancer, kidney and eye.
Regarding the 100M Japanese fully funded Women’s and Children’s Hospital as a 50th Independence Anniversary Gift mentioned by Professor Mola, Dr. Molumi explained that there was a decision taken (in consultation with PMGH's Board, National Capital District Provincial Health Authority (NCD PHA), National Department of Health (NDoH) and the Ministry of Health) with regards to a JICA Grant Proposal for Maternal and Child Health to establish this facility at Gerehu Hospital, a Level 4 Hospital.
NCD PHA aims to develop the Gerehu Hospital as a center of excellence for maternal and child health, where PMGH has a MOU with NCD PHA to provide human resources and technical support for the facility. Logically, Gerehu Hospital's strategic location offers easy access to cover over 70 per cent of city residents and 100 per cent of rural patients traveling via the Hiritano and Magi highways.
He said over 80 per cent of deliveries at PMGH are normal cases which can be handled at Gerehu allowing PMGH to concentrate on complicated deliveries and tertiary care services.
Dr. Molumi added that NCD PHA aims to develop the Gerehu Hospital as a center of excellence for maternal and child health, where PMGH has an MOU with NCD PHA to provide human resources and technical support for the facility.

While this longer-term plan is being implemented, the concerns raised by Dr. Mola need to be addressed urgently.
Therefore, PMGH plans to install modular delivery rooms and maternity wards at Gerehu Hospital, Six Mile Clinic and other clinics identified by NCD PHA with technical and staffing support from PMGH."

Prioritising education in new district,22/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4088,,Education,Joy,"Rainbo Paita, Solen Loifa","Education empowers citizens to pursue a better life for themselves and their families.
Opportunities are limitless once education opens the door.
This is why the Wau-Waria district, on Friday, March 28th, opened a number of educational projects.
While it is the newest district in Morobe – being separated from Bulolo in 2022 – Wau-Waria is becoming the fastest growing district in the province, in terms of development.
Within just two years, first-term MP, Marsh Narewec, who is a computer programmer by profession, has started building new roads, upgraded the Wau police station, built new police houses and equipped their police personnel with firearms and new police vehicles.
On Friday, March 28th, Narewec and his colleague MPs – Rainbo Paita from Finschhafen and Menyamya’s active political representative, Solen Loifa – opened and launched a number of education projects. These projects include the opening of a new 4-in-1 Grace Memorial Secondary School teachers’ house, the opening of a new 4-in-1 classroom building for Wau Primary School and the groundbreaking of a new staff house for Grace Memorial, a new science lab, a new FODE Centre and a Technical and Vocational Education and Training Centre.
Speaking under heavy downpour at the Grace Memorial Secondary School, local MP Narewec outlined the support given to all levels of education.
“For the education sector, in 2023 we started subsidising tertiary students’ fees,” said Narewec.
“In 2023, we spent about K700,000 and we subsidised the fees of over 200 students in the universities and colleges.
“In 2024, we spent about K900,000 and we subsidised the fees of over 200 tertiary students as well.
“We have only one secondary school in Wau-Waria district. This secondary school, in the first year, in 2023, we put K1 million and renovated Grace Memorial. In 2024, we spent over K1 million to construct the 4-in-1 staff house.
“For primary education, we have noted that Wau Primary School has the potential to become a junior high school, so in 2023, we spent K1 million and renovated the school. In 2024, we spent another K1 million and constructed a 4-in-1 classroom.
“Aside from infrastructure, the Wau-Waria district met all costs for primary school teachers to go for further training in 2023, 2024 and 2025 as well.
“Under TVET, we have initiated a youth empowerment program where about 51 students are preparing to graduate with National Certificate II.”
Narewec drew attention to the government’s reform in the education system, especially the Standard-Based Curriculum with the 1-6-6 structure, replacing the 3-6-4 school structure. This now involves a new framework beginning with one year of early childhood education, six years in primary school then another six in junior high school and secondary, with no dropouts.
He challenged respective school boards to prepare to cater for all students as they continue into Grade Nine – with no Grade Eight examination – and Grade 12 being their only exit.
“We want to support the national government’s education policy of 1-6-6, and because Grace Memorial is the district’s only secondary school, and all students will be continuing to Grade Nine, we will need more classrooms, dormitories and staff houses.
“We have already built a staff 4-in-1 house, and the Mineral Resources Authority will most likely open its double classroom in its own time. We acknowledge the MRA for their contribution as a development partner.”
The Grace Memorial Secondary School had been without proper running water for over a decade. Principal, Zuhukec Oting, confirmed that water has been restored after receiving funding from the provincial government’s Infrastructure Development Grant (IDG). This means students and staff can now access proper running water to cook, do their laundry and shower.
Wau-Waria’s acting district education manager, Sesinu Samandingke, said now that they have gotten their own district, they have started checking schools to make sure they are in operation, and also have implemented a monitoring system so school inspectors can do quarterly inspections.
Out of Wau-Waria’s 25 registered primary schools, only 23 are in operation. The primary schools of Tegadu and Geni have been indefinitely suspended due to their remoteness. Like other schools in the country, teachers have left their posts as life is difficult in these far-flung areas where there is no government service.
“We currently have no high school or junior high, only Grace Memorial. But under the new structure, and as was endorsed by the Morobe Provincial Education Division that each district needs to have its own high school,” Samandingke outlined.
“Next year, with the next funding, the first Grade Nine intakes will be taken in by Wau Primary School, making it Wau Junior High School.
“Another school that we will be initiating projects next year is Kasangare Primary School, which will be elevated to Kasangare Junior High School in Waria LLG, our local MP’s place. DDA has already passed K1 million to commence work.
“My job is to work with the survey department to get workers, work with our district administrator and the recently-established committee to collaborate and do groundwork until we achieve our goal.
“Garaina Primary School is also scheduled to get junior high status; close to six or seven schools are within Garaina.”
Samandingke said they have already created teaching positions for preschools, primary schools and junior high schools, including Grace Memorial Secondary School. They are now waiting for the Education Department to endorse their plan and advertise the vacancies. Additionally, new schools are to be registered.
The acting district education manager outlined that the district has embarked on an ambitious plan to ensure quality education for its people; starting from early childhood to tertiary level and youth programs."

Condolence Message from Prime Minister James Marape on the Passing of His Holiness Pope Francis,21/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4081,,Religion,Sadness,James Marape,"The death of Pope Francis on this Easter Monday is not only a loss to the Catholic faithful but to all humanity.
Prime Minister James Marape, on behalf of the people of Papua New Guinea, has sent his condolences.
It is with profound sorrow that I extend, on behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea, our deepest condolences to the global Catholic community and the Holy See on the passing of His Holiness Pope Francis.
He was a spiritual father to over a billion Catholics around the world and a moral voice of conscience in times of global uncertainty. His humility, compassion, and unwavering commitment to justice, peace, and the environment earned him respect far beyond the Church.
Papua New Guinea had the distinct honour of welcoming His Holiness during his historic Apostolic Visit from 6 to 9 September 2024, a moment of immense spiritual significance for our country.
During his time in Port Moresby and Vanimo, Pope Francis brought a message of unity, inclusion, and hope. His public Mass at Sir John Guise Stadium and his engagements with our young people and church leaders left an indelible impression on all who witnessed them. His words and presence inspired our people, reminding us to care for the vulnerable, to act justly, and to walk humbly with God.
To the College of Cardinals, to the Vatican, and to Catholics across Papua New Guinea and the world, we grieve with you. Pope Francis lived and died in service to God and humanity, and he now rests in eternal peace.
May his soul find rest in the arms of the Almighty, and may his life’s example continue to guide us—towards humility in leadership, compassion in service, and faith in action."

Madang partners with OPIC,21/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4072,,Business,Anticipation,"Francis Maneke, Ramsey Pariwa","A milestone for Papua New Guinea’s agriculture sector, the Madang Provincial Government and the Oil Palm Industry Corporation (OPIC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in Port Moresby that sets the foundation for a new era of inclusive, regulated, and sustainable oil palm development.
The MoU was signed by OPIC General Secretary Kepson Pupita and Madang Acting Provincial Administrator Daniel Aloi in the presence of Minister for Oil Palm Francis Maneke and Madang Governor Ramsey Pariwa. This is the first formal provincial partnership under the new Ministry of Oil Palm, making Madang the pilot province for an innovative model that brings together national government agencies, provincial authorities, landowners, and the private sector.
“This is a historic day for our industry and our country,” Minister Maneke said.
“For decades, oil palm has developed without proper oversight or equitable participation. Today, we are charting a new path—one that is guided by law, rooted in sustainability, and driven by our people.”
Oil palm remains one of Papua New Guinea’s most valuable agricultural commodities, contributing significantly to rural incomes and foreign exchange earnings.
Yet for over 50 years, the sector has largely been sustained by private milling companies, with minimal government involvement and limited benefits flowing directly to customary landowners.
Minister Maneke noted that the Marape-Rosso Government, in its drive to boost agriculture and reduce dependency on imports, has prioritised the transformation of the oil palm industry.
This includes:
* The creation of the Ministry of Oil Palm,
* The approval of a National Oil Palm Development Policy, and
* The drafting of a comprehensive Oil Palm Industry Bill, which is now in final consultation stages.
“Our government has made the strategic decision to reclaim ownership of this industry and build a framework where landowners, provinces, and developers work together,” Maneke said.
The MoU signed with the Madang Provincial Government includes a strong focus on customary land registration, demarcation, and mobilisation—a key challenge that has hampered the expansion of commercial agriculture in PNG.
“We will work with the Department of Lands and the provincial administration to ensure landowners gain secure titles,” Minister Maneke explained.
“This makes land bankable and ensures landowners are not just bystanders but active shareholders in oil palm investments.”
This includes support for converting vast stretches of underutilised grassland in areas like the Ramu Valley into productive oil palm plantations, with full adherence to environmental and sustainability standards.
The partnership also includes collaboration with existing milling companies such as Ramu Agri Industries, while also allowing for new investment models under OPIC’s coordination where appropriate."

Dr Gena said the approach they took to obtain further education signifies that learning does not stop.
He thanked Datec for partnering with UOT to drive the programs, which meet the government's vision of leaving no child behind."

Sinai says the structure of the local level government for elections is out of order, even though Papua New Guinea’s population is smaller than most countries.
He said he has traveled the world and seen various data management during elections in different countries, however none is suitable for PNG’s local level government structure.
“We have been given some time to hunt around the world to find the best available data management in the world and there is none,” Sinai said.

“Seeing is believing. So any mindset thinking about biometrics in PNG should stop now. If someone is saying biometric will solve our problems, they need to stop. In elections, it won’t work,” he said.

‘Keep on keeping on’,18/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4045,,Education,Hope,Nill,"It’s not the end, if you haven’t figured what to do with your life yet.
This was the encouragement from a registered valuer and alumna of the PNG University of Technology, Dr Flora Kwapena, during the university’s 57th graduation ceremony on Friday, April 11th, in Lae.
Dr Kwapena, who was the guest speaker at PNGUoT’s 57th graduation ceremony, in Lae, has served in different sectors throughout her professional career; from academia to the private sector, public service and research sector as well.
Speaking to the over 800 graduands, Dr Kwapena gave the gentle reminder that each person has his or her own timeline. And it is not the end if they have not figured out their path yet.
“I was unemployed for a year after I had graduated,” she recalled. “Then I got a job at Qantas Airways as a sales consultant; nothing to do with the degree that I got at Unitech. It wasn’t my dream job but I was getting an income. That’s the main thing.
“Every day, I tell myself: ‘Things will get better. I just have to keep on keeping on.’”
Dr Kwapena, who is currently running her own small-to-medium enterprise, highlighted that social factors such as unemployment, discrimination, lack of support and financial hardship may lead to depression for new graduates. However, she urged them to always believe in themselves and persevere.
“They just have to keep on keeping on because tomorrow is always a better day,” she continued.
“It was a year later that I got a job in a real estate company and I was the assistant valuer. From there, I started to do what I graduated in from Unitech – valuation. And that led me to the public service.
“Funny thing is, I went under the mentorship of the first Valuer General of Papua New Guinea, Mr Mark Kelep. And I became the first female Valuer General of Papua Guinea, which is a post that I am very proud of.”
Her training under Mr Kelep led to her employment as a Senior Valuer with the Lands Department. There, Dr Kwapena obtained her registration as a Registered Valuer in PNG, and was also awarded an AusAID scholarship to do a Master’s in real estate at the University of New South Wales.
Armed with her Master’s, she taught at PNGUoT, then moved on to becoming the valuer general of PNG for one term, then continued on to the research sector with the National Research Institute of PNG as a Research Fellow (in the Property Sector Program).
It was from NRI that she pursued a PhD at the University of Sunshine Coast, in Queensland.
After obtaining the highest level of academic achievement, a PhD, Dr Kwapena has “realigned, reassessed and redirected” herself towards self-employment, operating a small property valuation firm.
“It is the hard days that will challenge you to your very core and will determine who you are,” outlined PNG’s first female Valuer General.
“You will be defined not just by what you achieve but by how you survive.”"

He said the elections are part of PNG’s Constitution under the Organic Law on Elections, and thus by law, it is now being executed.

“The province has a total of 137 polling teams to cover 534 polling venues. Polling officials total 196, while there are 345 counting officials,” Voivoi outlined.
“Nomination fee is K200 across the board for both candidates contesting the Ward Member and LLG presidential seats.
“Nominations will be accepted for the first five days by the AROs at their respective LLGs, while I will be accepting nominations in the last two days of the seven-day nomination period (24th April – 1st May).”
As opposed to the previous election, East New Britain is among a number of provinces that will see both the Ward Member and LLG President voted by the people.
Ballot papers for the Ward Member are red while and LLG President ballot paper is green.
Mano has also called for quality leadership in these elections, saying the province needs leaders who are bold and can micro-manage their constituents to be self-reliant and self-sufficient.
“Amidst our current issues in the province, we need leaders at the ward and LLG who are not quick to blame others but are responsible for their own communities. And these are leaders who experience the hardships with their people and work with them to resolve issues, as they persevere to develop their communities,” he stated."

“This approach can lead to job creation, skills development, and increased revenue, as well as promote local brands in the global market.”
Bando also emphasized that the Government will continue to roll-out the freight and price support exercise through the green gold card."

The PNG Electoral Commission will go ahead to issue writs next week for the Motu Koita Assembly and the LLG elections throughout the country will go ahead as scheduled.

“Electoral roll is a prevailing issue. In Motu Koita we have 14 wards and I wish if we can identify all those people by age, group, clan, tribe, and ward, it would be good for the elections now and the Motu Koita open electoral in 2027. So, we are looking at that kind of perception in terms of data, unfortunately we are not given enough time that can satisfactorily complete the job, so we are happy about being prepared for elections.”
Sinai called on citizens to consider these facts and not to blame anyone for election related issues.
“Who are we going to blame if we are not going to prepare ourselves for the elections, at some extent we are in charge but as people we have to know where our identity is.”
Sinai said his aim is for every citizen to practice their right and vote, with proper identification.
“As the Commissioner I want to see everyone get ready to cast the vote. We have done practical changes to the roll, we are advocating face-to-the-name roll under biometric identity we trialed at Tatana in December last year, Kupiano and ward 5 and it worked there's some costs but it's working.”
His suggestion of face identification biometric database is not a solution to election issues, but a deterring factor as it comes back to database.
“These are things we need to sort out before elections, this is the right time to do it before 2027.”"

Sumkar cocoa development project makes progress,17/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4025,,Agriculture,Anticipation,Nill,"Sumkar District Cocoa Development Program is an initiative of the Sumkar District Development Authority (SDDA).
Despite it being a yearly planned activity in the sector for the past decade, funding has always been the main challenge. Though there were other factors (as the pod borer, the low pricing, lack of farmers interest, etc.) that hindered the progress of the cocoa development activities, funding was the factor that weighed more and that could have solved other limiting factors.
Opportunity for the district agriculture sector to implement those planned activities for cocoa development in the district arose when funds were made available by the SDDA in the third quarter of 2024.
The Sumkar DDA has supported a cocoa development program aimed at revitalizing the local cocoa industry. The program has begun with the distribution of a 100, 000 polybags and now nursed in numerous nurseries across both LLGs this effort is to support cocoa farmers to improve and increase cocoa production in the district, the province and the nation as a whole.
In line with revitalizing cocoa production within the district, they have engaged in various activities to enable farmer capacity in both LLGs of Sumgilbar and Karkar to benefit from the current high return rate of cocoa bag sale.
Nursery establishment
A sector Nursery with a capacity of 12, 000 polybags has been established at the Miak DPI station to not only support but to sustain the initiative of the DDA. It is anticipated that by June this year, the clonal seedlings would be ready for field planting. The clone materials would be sold to public on a favorable price just to sustain the nursery operations for the next cycle.
Cloning & Budding
Following the successful distribution of polybags, budding activities have started on Karkar Island and will slowly come across to the mainland. This involves budding high-yield clonal seedlings, which is a key step towards ensuring better productivity and crop quality.
Budding activities have commenced starting from Miak cocoa nursery last month and will continue through to August. Very experienced and skilled budders would be engaged for the 100, 000 rootstocks raised.
According to the Office of the Sumkar MP, Alex Suguman, this would be an expensive exercise but needs to be done so that all rootstocks are cloned before bound for field planting. In addition, they will be conducting necessary cocoa husbandry trainings in the nurseries to the selected participating farmers, which is also an additional cost.
It is anticipated that after three years, the cocoa trees currently nursed from the polybags distributed would have been bearing and by the fourth year, it would have started its potential yield till its 10th year of full potential.
“We will definitely have an increase of around 90, 000 cocoa trees which is around 144 hectares to the current cocoa tree population in the district after a year from planting,” said Suguman.
Additionally, a projection of the Return of Investment is calculated to be at 210.86 percent. The given ROI is derived from an estimated total revenue of K76, 400 with a net profit of K51, 850 aft the 4th year of planting.
“This gives me the opportunity to report on another similar program in our Sumkar district. Sumkar District is set to roll out another cocoa program, funded by the province. Notably, the provincial cocoa development project is well-aligned with the Sumkar DDA’s existing initiative of creating an opportunity for collaboration and synergy between the district and provincial programs.
“This` alignment is expected to amplify the impact of the overall cocoa development effort and further benefit local farmers.”"

Joy whose part East New Britain and Oro, is a third-year student on scholarship under Athletics Development program at the National Sports Institute in Goroka. The program helps students to train and study at the same time.
Joy said she's really embracing the challenge so far juggling Sports training and her studies.
""So far it's been so good for me I think for the other athletes too because everything is provided for us. But then it comes back to us. If we dedicate ourselves to it. . but so far so good,” Joy briefly reflects back on where her interest in athletics started.
“For me I think it started from school carnivals. I was in 7th grade when I started. It wasn't much of an interest for me but when there's school carnivals I just go out there to compete and somehow became good at it. That's when I realized the potential I have in athletics. As I continued to take part in carnivals my interest continued to grow as well.”
She said that it was through head coach, late Ssmu Sasama who saw her potential got her into the program. Some of her highlights so far including attending the Oceania Athletics Championships in Fiji June 2024.
""This Oceania Championships really surprised myself. I didn't think I would go and to run a good time and stand on the podium, but yes, we performed well there and I ran a PB too which I' myself so proud of and also helped to get some medals for PNG.""
Joy was always thankful for making the team to her coaches while acknowledging God for making everything possible. Her next focus and biggest challenge is the Pacific Mini Games in Palau in June.
She said training started as early as mid-February and although challenging she's committed it physically, mentally and spiritually and happy with her progress so far.
""I had to keep myself keeping on mentally, and physically training on the track, both juggling studies and training at the same time. So, for me it's been going good and I'm hoping to keep it up until the games.""
She targets for the Pacific Mini Games is to run some more new personal bests, and try beat her own times. Even breaking the national record would be a pinnacle of her journey so far but had to work really hard for it.
While she's so grateful for the support of her family it was also an emotionally moment remembering the passing of her late dad early this year which was devastating being her strongest supporter.
For him (dad) he's the one who believed in me that I could make it in athletics. Sadly, dad passed away before he could see run on the big stage.
Joy extended her gratitude to the National Sports Institute for giving her the opportunity to be part of the program especially, director Janet Gimots and the coaching staff Philip Nomane and Subul Babo, and fellow athletes for being great companions at training."

MKA Wins Court Case,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4011,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"The National Court in Waigani on Tuesday 15th April ruled in favour of Motu Koita Assembly (MKA) following an application to restrain its operations.
The application also asked the Court to issue restraining orders against current MKA Chairman and his Assembly Members from holding office. This too was dismissed by the Court.
The Plaintiffs in the matter are Veata Patana, Edward Collett and Russell Wavik among others.
The Court found that the plaintiffs had no arguable case, stating that the MKA Act has clear provisions to allow for members to remain in office until the return of the writ of the next general elections.
The Court made the following remarks, regarding the question of whether the Plaintiffs have an arguable case; “contrary to what the plaintiffs claimed to be a violation of their rights under Section 50, there is a strong defense by the second defendant that no serious issue has been established in these proceedings because Section 11(2) of the MKA Act applies in a case where regardless of the expiration of five years, elected members including the Chairman of the Assembly hold office until the date fixed for the return of the writs for the next general elections held after their election.”
After reviewing the evidence provided, Judge Makail stressed the need for continuity within MKA to avoid a vacuum and to protect the integrity of the due process until the next general elections are held.
The Court also ordered all the plaintiffs pay all of the Assembly and Dadi Toka Jr’s legal bills."
Man arrested for impersonating Madang administrator,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4006,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"Police in Madang have arrested and charged a man for impersonating the Acting Madang Provincial Administrator, Daniel Aloi an act that sought to disrupt official administrative process.
The suspect, Junior Keving, 28, from Yandra village in Usino-Bundi district, was apprehended on Friday, April 11th at 3pm. This arrest followed an investigation into a fraudulent letter intended to undermine the authority of the Acting PA.
The letter dated, April 8th and delivered on April 10th to both the Provincial Treasury Office and Bank of South Pacific Finance Limited Madang branch, cast doubt on Mr Aloi’s legitimacy, thereby misleading critical financial and administrative operations.
Madang Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim, confirmed the suspect’s arrest stating that police acted based on substantial legal evidence.
“This individual deliberately misled government institutions by using false claims to impersonate a public office holder. Our investigation revealed that the letter referenced an outdated court order that had been dismissed by the National Court on March 7th,” said Commander Baim.
He emphasized the importance of adhering to proper communication channels in administrative matters.
“There are no ongoing court matters related to this case. The suspect’s actions not only contravene the law but also pose a serious threat to the administration and financial functions of the Provincial government. Impersonating public servants to interfere with official processes is unacceptable,” he added.
Baim further warned that any individual attempting to disrupt government operations will face legal repercussions.
The suspect has been charged with one count of impersonating a public officer under Section 97 of the PNG Criminal Code Act and is in police custody. Authorities indicate that further arrests may occur as investigations continue into any additional parties involved.
Commander Baim urged the public to avoid spreading misinformation and to uphold the rule of law and administrative procedures within the province."

The man from Enga province was charged with false representations in obtaining a passport and for being in possession of a fraudulently obtained passport under section 15 and 16 of the PNG Passport Act respectively.

“I must remind our people that ICSA maintains a strict compliance to the Passport Act and its regulation and operate within the guidelines set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on the management and security of travel documents,” the Chief Migration Officer, Wellington Navasivu said.
“This act to obtain travel documents fraudulently is treated with outmost seriousness and my officers are working with police to further investigate and impose additional penalties using laws that ICSA administers”.
Mr Navasivu warned individuals who unlawfully engage in identity theft or in similar fraudulent activities to obtain passport and visa to think twice before they act.
He also warned that ICSA would soon be implementing new technologies to improve its capabilities in passport and visa systems that will soon include the mandatory rollout of biometrics, facial recognition and artificial intelligence that are aimed at improving national security, prevent travel document fraud and safeguard the borders from external threats."
Milne Bay Community Rallies for Disaster Relief,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4008,,Community,Joy,Nill,"In the true spirit of unity and compassion, the Milne Bay community in Port Moresby is coming together for the First Milne Bay Community Fun Day – Ae Kapore Island Jam Session, aimed at supporting over 3,000 people affected by recent torrential rains and king tides on Ware Island and nearby communities within the Bwanabwana Rural LLG and Samarai-Murua districts.
The event, set for Saturday, April 19 at Kamane Recreation (formerly Sportsmen Bar), Murray Barracks, will serve as a donation drive under the Ware Island Community Disaster Relief initiative. Spearheaded by concerned locals Jerome Peniasi, Jerry Mark, and Abigayle Maggio, the fundraiser is supported by wONEm Direction and the Milne Bay Community Association Inc. (MBCA).
Communities in Ware Island are facing dire conditions—subsistence gardens have been washed away, fresh waterholes destroyed, and daily survival has become increasingly difficult.
“The impact is heartbreaking,” said event co-organizer Abigayle Maggio. “People have lost not just homes, but their food, water, and sense of security. We cannot sit by and do nothing.”
The Ae Kapore Island Jam Session has grown into a beloved cultural event over the past two years, combining Milne Bay’s rich music heritage with a platform for local SMEs to sell traditional food, crafts, and clothing.
This Saturday’s edition will feature over 20 local SMEs and live performances from Kapole Stringband (wONEm Direction), Peter Philemon of Alopops, Extracts of Alotau, and surprise local artists.
The event is more than entertainment—it’s a lifeline. In previous years, proceeds supported vital causes such as:
2023: Funding local rice farming in Bou, Logea, Sariba, and Wamira through the Trukai Smart Farmers Program.
2024: Delivering more than 15 bags of essentials and 50 bags of 10kg Skel Rice to flood-affected communities in Goodenough Island.
Recognised by the National Cultural Commission, wONEm Direction—a stringband collective of youths from Suau, Dobu, Wagawaga, Nuwakata, and Misima—is also helping preserve Milne Bay’s iconic 5-key string band sound while using music as a tool for social impact.
Looking ahead, the MBCA and wONEm Direction plan to host four Community Fun Days in 2025, each supporting a different rural community in need.
“When one island hurts, we all feel it,” said co-organiser Jerry Mark. “This is about helping each other, the Milne Bay way.”
Organisers are calling on the public to donate, attend, and support this community-led effort. For those unable to attend but wishing to contribute or partner in future fundraisers, email wonemdirection@gmail.com or message the official MBCA Facebook page."
EC makes change in councilors election,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3995,,Politics,Anticipation,Nill,"Polling and counting for councilors election will take place in wards starting with this year’s local level government (LLG) elections, says electoral commissioner Simon Sinai.
When announcing the election dates for the LLG election on Monnday, 14th April in Port Moresby, Sinai said that previously, voters in the villages had to travel for a distance to a designated place for voting.
This year, for council elections, voters will have the privilege to vote in their wards. Poling and counting will take place all at the same time. It will be initiated in a ward and move to the next ward simultaneously.
“We have made a decision that we will take the ballet boxes back to you and you take ownership. It means that council elections we will poll and count at the polling place and it will be under LPV voting system not first past the post.
Counting for by elections will happen at a designated center and not at the wards and LLG level.
“For the by-elections, we will have separate counting centers but polling in the same location.
For Morobe and Highlands regions, they will vote for their councilors, who will then meet in the chamber to vote for their president.”
He said the polling and counting for the councilors, presidents, and by-elections will take place within 14 days. Therefore, he urged the community to work with the election officials to ensure transparency is upheld during the election.

Children deserve to thrive,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3998,,Health,Trust,Nill,"Papua New Guinea has faced ongoing challenges in health, nutrition, and development, leading to persistent malnutrition that impacts infants, children, women, and men at all stages of life.
This malnutrition often results in decreased productivity within communities, hindering their ability to create economic opportunities and escape the cycle of poverty.
On Wednesday, April 9, 2025, World Vision Papua New Guinea (WVPNG) signed a Sub-Grant agreement with the Department for Religion and Community Development at Sambra Haus in Port Moresby.
This agreement with the DFCDR bolsters WVPNG’s ongoing efforts to combat malnutrition and address the underlying causes of poverty and inequality as part of our Health and Nutrition Portfolio.
Present at the signing was Secretary of Religion and Community Development Jerry Ubase, Deputy Secretary Implementation- Karen Haive, Deputy Secretary- Equality and Inclusion- Jack Simbou and Component Manager, CNSP Project-Joseph Klapat, alongside the World Vision PNG team including National Director Chris Jensen, Program Operations Director Godfrey Bongomin, Program Development and Quality Director Christabel Chan, and Health and Nutrition Portfolio Manager Agnes Tal and Freda Pake - a  representative from the World Bank.
This project funded by the World Bank targets to reach 60,000 beneficiaries in key impact areas in the selected provinces.
WVPNG will begin the second phase of this project in the Western and Madang provinces, focusing on enhancing child nutrition through sustainable economic practices for 20,000 mothers and their children in the first 1000 days in 60 communities across these two provinces.
Secretary Ubase emphasized the importance of collaboration.
“We rely on partners like World Vision PNG to deliver such nutrition programs through their experience and technical expertise. We believe this project will improve the lives of children in vulnerable communities of PNG.”
In alignment with World Vision’s mission for every child to thrive, National Director Chris Jensen expressed gratitude to the donors and partners involved in the initiative.
He highlighted the significance of cooperation, noting, “No single organisation can do this alone. We are grateful to be part of this project alongside the World Bank, partner NGO, the Department of Community Development and Religion, and local authorities. Together, we can achieve meaningful outcomes.”
The desired outcomes for this project include providing families, particularly women and children, with economic and sustainable support to foster nutritional change at home. Key tangible outcomes will involve:
1. Monthly child grants deposited directly into the savings accounts of mothers and caregivers, ensuring access regardless of location, and empowering women to make informed financial decisions. By enhancing their investments and understanding of nutrition, these women will improve their children's health and well-being. WVPNG will gather data from women, caregivers, and health posts to measure the impacts of the child grant.
2.  Strengthening caregivers' resilience through improved financial management and sustainable agriculture by promoting “Savings for Nutrition.” This initiative aims to increase household cash flow for better food, shelter, education, and other essential expenses for children.
3.  Raising awareness within the community regarding climate change and disaster preparedness.
4. Establishing backyard gardens for caregivers, allowing them to cultivate nutritious food sustainably for consumption and potential income generation.
This collaborative effort represents a significant leap towards tackling malnutrition and fostering healthier futures for children and families in Papua New Guinea."

The Commissioner said the vehicles, purchased by the Marape-Rosso Government through the Special Police Assistance Program, is a cost-effective break from the past.
""This is a change from how police vehicles had been managed and is saving the country a considerable amount of money.
""The overall cost of the new vehicles is 31 million Kina and will save an estimated 54 million Kina in annual hire car costs.
""Our objective is to have a dependable fleet of RPNGC-owned vehicles before the 2027 National General Elections.

Feeder Road Delay Affects Rural Communities,14/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3972,,Infrastructure,Anger,Nill,"Residents in the Koiari Local Level Government area have raised concerns on the lack of progress on the Koitaki to Doe road.
The 25-kilometre feeder route is in disrepair—despite over half a million kina already paid for its rehabilitation.
According to locals, on December 18, 2024, the Department of Central paid K590,362.10 to a local contractor as 40 percent mobilisation funding for Phase 1 works, which was to include regrading of the deteriorating road. But today, four months later, there are still no signs of machines or workers on site.
Community leader Oga Erehe stated, “I am appealing to the political leaders to consider our concerns. The feeder roads are very important where majority of the population live and survive in rural areas.”
“Our road from Sogeri to Doe has been neglected for over 50 or 60 years. During colonial times, this was a good road. Since Independence, it went back to the 40s and 30s road conditions – very, very bad.”
The poor state of the road not only affects everyday travel for villagers but also hinders the rollout of a significant impact project by Golden Peak Limited, a 100 percent nationally owned company ready to commence work at the road’s end.
Locals are now demanding an immediate investigation by the Central Provincial Administration, Governor, and the Hiri Koiari MP, urging that the contract be reassigned to a capable, transparent contractor with machinery, manpower, and proven capacity to deliver."
A journey of resilience,14/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3970,,Education,Joy,Nill,"For the first time ever, the PNG University of Technology hosted its graduation ceremony outside its main Taraka campus in Lae, Morobe Province.
Under clear skies on Friday, April 11th, graduands in their flowing academic regalia lined up in their respective schools, in anticipation of the procession into the Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium’s indoor complex.
Leading the charge was 49-year-old Kainantu woman, Helen Osora; the only female Doctor of Philosophy graduand in applied physics.
She is one of the 54 candidates graduating from the Faculty of Postgraduate Studies, Research and Innovation; three PhDs, 11 Postgraduate Certificate in Student-Centred Teaching and 40 Master’s from various disciplines.
Her determination to accomplish that milestone saw her complete her studies within the given four-year timeframe, despite taking one year off due to severe illness.
Her thesis was on “Synthesis and Electrochemical Investigations of some Metal Oxide Based Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanocomposite for Supercapacitor Electrode Applications”.
“I did my study on battery – energy storage. But more specific on battery,” she explained.
Osora’s research looked into incorporating graphene oxide with transition metal oxides to work out the energy density. Energy density is the amount of energy that can be stored in a battery, taking into consideration its size or weight.
“I did the hybrid type because we have capacitors which store energy, and we also have batteries. Batteries have more power while capacitors have less energy density but they charge faster and discharge very fast too. So, I had to come up with a hybrid; I combined the features of the capacitors and the batteries so it will take a short time to charge car batteries. For example, Tesla is currently using the charging stations for its electric vehicles.
“So, I had to come up with a supercapacitor; that’s the name given to the hybrid type.”
The mother-of-three has been teaching physics at the University of Goroka since 2008. Prior to that, she had taught at the PNG University of Technology for four years.
She had completed her Master’s in Applied Physics, returned to UOG and worked for five years, then went back to PNGUoT to complete her PhD under UOG sponsorship.
“I’ve developed physics courses for the University of Goroka,” she beamed when asked about a highlight in her career.
“That is the most satisfactory thing that I can do to give back to my country.
“Since 2008-2019; in between that, I was able to produce several courses for the university. So, currently, students are taking my physics courses.”
Osora, who has had to raise her three children by herself, thanked the University of Goroka for supporting her Master’s and PhD studies.
She shared that she fell ill in October 2020, and was sick for the duration of 2021. Her three children – the youngest being only 12 years of age – were her pillars of strength throughout that time. She acknowledged them for supporting her through a turbulent period.
Osora also appreciated the PNGUoT vice chancellor, Professor Ora Renagi, for always encouraging postgraduate students.
“Unitech is advancing compared to other universities,” she stated.
“Most importantly, I give praise and honour to God because I went through difficulties and God was always with me.
“Also, my thank you to my supervisor, Dr Senthilkumar Velusamy. I was sick and I can remember, I wanted to withdraw and I asked him but two times, he said, ‘This is not my plan for you.’
“My supervisor was always at my back until I completed my studies so I am very thankful for him. I was lucky to have him.”"

Former Madang principal arrested for misappropriation,13/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3967,,Education,Anger,Nill,"Former principal of Aiome Anglican Secondary School Francis Kumo, was arrested last month (March) on charges of abuse of office and misappropriation of school funds. This action follows a formal complaint lodged in 2024 by teachers and school board members, alleging Kumo misused funds and engaged in fraudulent activities from 2018 to 2024.
Even through Kumo is no longer working for the school, it is alleged that Kumo reportedly continued to access the school’s operating account in February 2025, where he allegedly withdrew K21, 000 without authorization from the school chairman or administration. Investigators also noted a suspicious payment of K4, 600 to HF Trading Limited for fuel, which school officials could not account for.
Madang Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim confirmed the arrest, stating, “The former principal was arrested at the Anglican Church premises in Madang town on Sunday, 2nd March 2025. He is currently in custody facing charges under the PNG Criminal Code Act for Fraudulent Appropriation of Power and Misappropriation of Property.”
The school’s financial records from 2018 to 2024 were examined using a search warrant, aiming to uncover further irregularities including transactions with vendors like BNBM Hardware for undelivered materials.
Baim emphasized the importance of integrity in public service, urging officials to serve the community with respect. The investigation is ongoing and police have called on anyone with information to come forward.
Kumo, 49, hails from Monega village in Sine LLG, Chuave District of Chimbu Province, and remains in custody as investigations continue.
The financial mismanagement has severely impacted the school, leading to food shortages and a lack of essential supplies, ultimately causing classes to suspend in 2024 and infringing on student rights to education."

“We acknowledge the support from the National Government, RPNGC Executive Management and our policing partner PNG-APP who have contributed immensely to ensure the Recruitment Process in RPNGC continues and we are able to bring in new employees to the organization,” says Tinga."
Provinces breaking Organic law s.119,13/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3963,,Government,Anger,Soroi Eoe,"Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs Soroi Eoe is deeply concerned about the constant lack of reporting by provincial governments on their performances, and has appealed to the provinces to submit their annual reports as required by law.
Minister Eoe also reminded provincial leaders that his department still has the legal mandate to demand for the administrative and financial audit of provincial governments, including holding individual leaders and bureaucrats accountable.
Under the Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Governments (OLPLLG) Section 119, all provincial governments are required to submit their annual performance reports on time, yet this has not been happening consistently over the last 10 years. Annual Provincial Performance Reports cover Minimum Priority Activities (MPAs), Governance, Health, Works & Transport, Law & Justice, and Primary Production.
A report from the Department of Inter-Government Relations has revealed that more than half of provincial governments have failed to comply with this necessary requirement over the years, especially from 2014 to 2023.
Minister Eoe said, “It is deeply concerning that only 10 out of 22 provinces have consistently complied with these requirements over the past 10 years. This lack of compliance not only undermines the principles of transparency and accountability that are fundamental to our governance but also hampers our ability to effectively monitor and enhance service delivery across the nation.
""The consequences of this non-compliance are severe and far-reaching. Our latest consolidated Annual Provincial Governments Performance Report (APGPR) has highlighted significant declines in critical areas such as health, education, primary production, law and justice, transport, and governance. These declines are directly attributable to the failure of many provinces submitting their required reports, which are essential for identifying and addressing these issues proactively.""
Provincial governments that have been consistent in submitting performance reports from 2014 to 2023 are East New Britain, Enga, Gulf, Hela, Manus, Milne Bay, New Ireland, Simbu, Sandaun, and Western.
“I commend the provincial governments that are cooperating with us.
“But it is very disappointing to see that, year after year, certain provincial governments continue to ignore this requirement as demanded by the OLPLLG. Yet, these very same people continue to call for National Government to acquit funds, knowing very well they themselves haven't acquitted their provincial government spending. National Government cannot fully acquit without all provincial government's acquittals.”
“This culture of negligence and lack of transparency is very concerning. It erodes confidence in our provincial leadership and the provincial government mechanism. Regular performance reports are necessary for effective monitoring and evaluation, and good service delivery to all our people in the provinces.”
“In line with our government’s efforts to devolve powers to provinces, reports are vital as this exercise has to be evidence-based according to performance. Provincial leaders cannot demand for more powers when they are not doing the basic work of demonstrating they are properly managing their provinces.”
“Let me remind all provincial leaders that even if the Supreme Court has invalidated Section 51 - 53 of OLPLLC on suspension of provincial governments, it does not prevent the administrative or financial audits of, or accountability measures against individual leaders,” said Minister Eoe."
St John responds to vehicle collision,13/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3964,,Accident,Fear,Nill,"The National Ambulance Operations Centre received a 111 call yesterday at 4:20pm reporting a collision involving two vehicles at Bomana Junction in the nation's capital.
The National St John Ambulance Service immediately dispatched two general ambulance crews and a clinical response unit. The incident was initially reported as involving a casualty trapped inside an easy loader truck.
Upon arrival, ambulance crews found that bystanders had partially assisted the casualty at the scene. A passing backhoe reportedly was used by members of the public to force open the vehicle door and remove the casualty.
According to the attending ambulance clinician, HEO Wemin Kopta, the patient was semi-conscious with serious injuries. Ambulance officers worked to stabilise him at the scene and then transported him urgently to Port Moresby General Hospital for further treatment.
Ambulance Public Affairs Alvin Leka, said the National St John Ambulance acknowledges the public’s goodwill and desire to help.
“However, we strongly urge members of the public not to attempt to remove injured persons from crashed vehicles unless there is a clear and immediate danger, such as fire.
“Well-intended but untrained actions can result in further harm to the injured. Just last week, an attempt by bystanders to assist resulted in a car being flipped and rolling down a slope, putting lives at greater risk.
“We ask all members of the public in Port Moresby and Central Province to please wait for professional emergency responders to arrive. Our teams are trained and equipped to manage injuries and safely extricate patients from vehicles. Your patience and cooperation help save lives,” Leka added.
Meanwhile, Police are investigating the incident."

In support of that, the commander of NCD and Central provinces Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi has tasked all barrack officers under the command of the OIC Barrack NCD Chief Inspector Sengi Laki to ensure that these instructions are enforced.
He emphasized that police officers must comply with this directive because their wives, husbands, and children need privacy and quality time with them. He also stated that relatives and friends of police officers must adhere to this and respect their friends or relatives who are in the barracks. Additionally, he called on the senior officers residing in the barracks to lead.
""We, as commanders and NCOs, must lead by speaking to our officers who are stepping out of line in the barracks. It all starts back at our house and continues to the workplace. If we can give commands at our respective police stations or sections, it's the same that we must do in the barracks. I want officers with ranks to lead by example,"" Turi said.
Commander Turi said all barracks must adhere to the directives from the commissioner."
Ronnie Lavai’s dreams of being an engineer,12/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3959,,Education,Joy,Nill,"Motivated by family and set to graduate with a National Certificate (NC)2 in Maintenance, Fitting and Machining (MFM) at Don Bosco Technical School (DBTS) in November, it is 24-year-old Ronnie Lavai’s hope to be a certified engineer one day.
“I have a son of my own, an eight-month-old baby. He is the main reason why I’m here; I mean my mum was first, but now I do it for both of them,” he says smiling.
With roots from West Kerema, Ihu LLG, Gulf Province, Ronnie was born and raised in Port Moresby and is the second last of six brothers and sisters.
“My dad is a teacher and the principal at Kaugere Junior High School while my mum is the primary caregiver, looking after the whole family at home,” he says.
After matriculating at Kila Kila Secondary School in 2021, he was accepted to study at the PNG University of Technology but due to school fees, could not attend.
“I played basketball for two years and I even represented the country twice, in 2021 and 2022, with the Flames Basketball club,” he shares.
“I originally didn’t have any interest in playing basketball but was encouraged by the people around me and then when I started playing, everything just sort of clicked into place. I was even thinking this (basketball), might be the answer for me,” he said.
Life it seems, had other plans for him as in 2023, he decided to do a short course on basic computing at the DBTS Gabutu campus, igniting in him a passion for computing.
“I did well so I decided to stay on. I thought I would be taking computing but because they had no computing classes, they offered their trade courses and that’s how I chose MFM, since MFM deals with metals and machining,” he explains.
Ronnie is one of 80 students from the current cohort of NC2 students at DBTS under the Papua LNG TVET Scholarship program, to be sponsored by TotalEnergies EP PNG Limited (TotalEnergies), operator of the Papua LNG project.
“It’s a big help for me and my family because my dad is the sole breadwinner, providing for the family. Since the scholarship came in, it has really helped my dad a lot,” he says.
“I have really learnt a lot. I knew when I was in Grade 12 at Kila Kila Secondary school, that I wanted to be an engineer. That hasn’t changed and I haven’t thought about doing anything else, I just know I want to build, fix and repair things,” he notes letting out a small laugh.
“My brothers are doing their own thing. I’m the only one in my family, out of us boys in school, so my dad has a lot of expectations of me,” he added.
Having maintained his academic performance, the Project has continued support to him throughout his second and final year of studies. He was initially identified as applicable for the Papua LNG scholarship program when he was applying for a trade course and it had been made known that he was from Gulf.
“After I graduate, hopefully I get a job and maybe work for a while – two or three years. Just to gain the experience and after that I can apply for tradesman certificates because nowadays, those certificates are the most in demand in the technical world,” he says.
“I want to be able to provide for my family and my son. I’m sure others who are fathers and young men have the same dream,” he adds happily."
Pariwa challenges Marape to honor commitments,12/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3955,,Politics,Anger,"James Marape, Ramsey Pariwa","Madang Governor, Ramsey Pariwa has challenged the Prime Minister, James Marape and his government to honor a K10 million commitment made last year to assist the displaced Manam islanders currently living in care centers in the Bogia and Sumkar districts.
Governor Pariwa made this call when addressing Manam islanders at Yassa village located at Postdam care centre two weeks ago.
Governor Pariwa was very vocal about this unfulfilled promise and blamed the National Government for failing its responsibility to assist the displaced Manam islanders.
The Madang governor openly shed tears when expressing sorrow and sympathy toward the displaced Manam islanders currently living in three care centres at Postdam and Asuramba in Bogia district and Mangem in Sumkar district.
He agreed with the president of Iabu Local Level Government, Kenny Boli that LLG funds to assist the Manam islanders was insufficient. Furthermore, the funding from Bogia district development Authority (DDA) and the Madang provincial government are also not adequate to address the many issues faced by the displaced people.
Governor Pariwa announced publicly that he is frustrated in the manner in which the Prime Minister, James Marape and the National Government had treated the displaced Manam islanders since they were evacuated to settle on the mainland with little attention by the national government.
Pariwa said the 2023 budgetary allocation for Manam islanders that is channeled to the Manam Resettlement Authority (MaRA) was K10 million. Unfortunately all these monies were not released.  A further funding allocation to Manam in 2024 was K20 million, however, to date only K4 million was released, and K16 million is still outstanding.
“From the K20 million the National Government released only K4 million to MaRA. K16 million is still outstanding and now we’re already in 2025,” Pariwa decried.
Pariwa  further noted that another 20 million was allocated in the 2025 budget for Manam.
He added that since taking office in 2023 he had seen how the National Government had been performing and noted that only paper budgets are passed, and strongly called on the prime minister to be serious about the Manam issue because the court had already declared the government’s negligence in handling the Manam issue.
Pariwa told the gathering that the government would pay K6 million upon the court’s order with interest. However, he said that amount is insufficient.
“I disagree a little to the court decision. They are supposed to give K100 million,” Pariwa said.
Pariwa challenged the Prime Minister to honor his government’s commitment during his visit to Madang on May 24, 2024 where he pledged a K10 million assistance to Manam.
“That time I challenged him that my people of Manam island need not to be living in care centres because you are not taking care of them. They are living in what looks like settlements,” Pariwa said.
“If you can take good care of foreigners arriving as asylum seekers from Australia and host them in hotels in Port Moresby, then why can’t you look after your own citizens. That’s not right and that’s not acceptable by a responsible government,” Pariwa said."
PNG 50 years ago with Colleen,11/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3953,,History,Nostalgia,Nill,"As the country’s 50th Independence Anniversary approaches, a 60-year-old Colleen recalls her participation in the Independence Celebrations on September 16, 1975.
Colleen, then 10 years old witnessed the Australian flag lowered one last time, and the Papua New Guinea flag raised for the very first time.
Colleen said she was selected among other students from her school, to participate in a march to celebrate this significant event in the country’s history, at what is now the Sir Hubert Murray stadium.
“I went to Gerehu Primary School. Each school was given big PNG Flags to march behind. It was such an exciting time and overwhelming (too). Everything felt so different though. People had their face painted in PNG colours. Vehicles were driving around (tooting) their horns and cheering on while we were marching.”
Colleen, a grandmother to three beautiful grandchildren, shared her thoughts on life today, over what it was like 50 years ago.
She said, “Back then when the Australian Government was still in control, food prices were low, services were better and there was a better lifestyle. Comparing that to now, so much has changed over the last 50 years. Sometimes I (think of) what it would be like if we never gained Independence.”
According to the Institute of Developing Economies, the Papua New Guinean Kina (PGK) had a relatively high value compared to the Australian dollar 5 decades ago. Food prices were generally considered low, although imported food prices did increase due to global inflation.
Colleen prays for the country, sharing that one day with the help of God, Papua New Guinea will go back to its glory days, where there was no inflation, life was easy and better services.
“There is still hope for change. I pray that the country will go back to how it was where there was no inflation, the government was transparent, no credits and many more. I am just glad I got to experience the celebration of my country’s Independence,” she said."

The MPs expressed in a joint statement that the Marape-led government has invested significantly in the province’s education and health infrastructure, demonstrating its commitment to our province’s development.
“We acknowledge and appreciate the new Porgera arrangement, which is hoped to provide greater returns to landowners and the provincial government, benefiting the people of Enga.
“We also acknowledge that Enga Provincial Government and the National government have been working on Business Development grants, Infrastructure Development grants and resettlement of SML land owners on the Porgera mine.
“We are of the view that Sir Peter Ipatas and PM James Marape continue to address the ongoing Porgera issues.
“Therefore, we ask the Governor of Enga to return to the government.”
The four leaders further said that they do give credit where it is due and commended the partnership between the Prime Minister and Sir Peter Ipatas in bringing about progressive development in the province.
“However, we must honestly establish that Sir Peter Ipatas had independently solicited the support of the opposition of the floor of Parliament to secure his nomination on the motion of VONC without any Engan leader’s consent, except from the Member for Wabag.
“We respect the governor’s decision he made as a leader on his own right.
“We, as leaders of Enga representing our districts, have collectively decided on our own conscience in the best interest of our electorates and the province as a whole to remain with the government.

LLG Elections Nearing,10/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3941,,Politics,Anticipation,Nill,"As the Local Level Government election approaches, the method of voting for the LLG presidents will not be uniform across the country.
In line with the National Executive Council decision of June 2024, some provinces including Madang will have the voters elect their presidents and town mayors while other provinces will go with the old method of councilors electing a president.
Madang Provincial Electoral Manager, Sponsa Navi, the nomination fees for all LLG candidates stand at K200.
However, he thinks that the nomination fees for those vying for the president’s seat should be increased to K500 as it is a higher level compared to a town mayor and ward council members. Navi is uncertain if there will be any changes with regard to nomination fees.
He said by increasing the fees, it will deter candidates from standing unnecessarily.
“In most instances, it has become a political gimmick for several candidates being sponsored by the same person just to split votes. It is a practice commonly used in elections nowadays, hence, if fees are increased, it would likely avoid this practice,” Navi added.
Meantime, despite the Electoral Commission assuring the public that the 2025 Local Level Government elections will proceed as scheduled, no funds have been released to the provincial level yet to prepare for this important constitutional event."

Eagles Show Faith ahead of Season,9/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3929,,Sports,Anticipation,Nill,"After recording their first national rugby league title win in 25 years last year (2024), the Wamp Nga Mount Hagen Eagles are set to defend their title in the 2025 season.
The Eagles’ inspirational skipper, Henry Wan Noki, said the Eagles have retained most of its players who won the competition in 2024. They are in good spirit heading into this year’s competition. He made this statement at Digicel ExxonMobil Cup 2025 Competition launch in Port Moresby.
The Eagles captain is confident they are still a strong side despite a few off-season setbacks.
One of their biggest loss is Lynchill Kiap, who was rewarded with a Hunters selection. He made his debut last weekend. Kiap was a key member in the Eagles spine. His service out from the dummy half proved critical. However, the Eagles captain said the team is intact and will do well this competition.
“I think 80% of the boys from last are still intact. Only a few of the boys have left and joined other franchise clubs but the core group of the boys are still intact so we are looking forward a better season this year,” said Noki.
Despite showing a lot of confidence in the team, questions have been raised whether the Eagles can defend their title without ex-coach, Francis Ray. Ray’s contribution was immense for the team with his invaluable experience in PNG national rugby league.
Noki, who didn’t want to reveal the name of the franchise’s new coach, instead said the new coach has been involved in rugby league with a number of franchise clubs before and would fit in well with the club culture.
“We have a new coach; our last year coach has left. And as players, nothing changes for us,” Noki said. “Our new coach has been with other franchises and involved with rugby league teams before and has got experience. Our Eagles system and culture from last year remains and the new coach will blend with our existing culture and system.”
The Digicel ExxonMobil Cup competition kicks off this weekend in Port Moresby with the grand final rematch between the Eagles and Hela Wigmen."

He emphasised that the Government, under the leadership of Prime Minister James Marape, is implementing clear development strategies through the Medium-Term Development Plan IV (MTDP IV) and the National Agriculture Sector Plan 2024–2033 (NASP).
These strategies aim to position agriculture as the cornerstone of national development, focusing on inclusive rural growth, climate adaptation, food security, and economic diversification.
“By 2033, we aim to establish agriculture as the backbone of a diversified, self-reliant, and globally competitive economy,” Boito stated.
He called on the private sector to actively engage in the agriculture value chain by investing in infrastructure, technology, and innovation. He cited successful initiatives such as pest-resistant cocoa programmes and co-investment projects in the coffee industry as examples of how collaborative efforts can transform the sector.
The conference brings together government leaders, industry players, and development partners to forge stronger public-private sector collaboration aimed at realising Papua New Guinea’s agriculture vision.

She was one of only eight recipients worldwide to be honored in a ceremony hosted by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and First Lady Melania Trump.
Major Iga, a senior officer with the Salvation Army House of Hope, was recognized for her exceptional leadership in combating gender-based violence, sorcery accusation-related violence, and human trafficking across Papua New Guinea.
For more than a decade, she has led advocacy efforts, developed vital support systems such as the “1-Tok” counseling hotline, and co-authored the country’s first Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Training Manual.
“This award is not about me,” said Major Iga. “It’s about every woman and child who deserves a voice and a safe future. Courage means strength, determination … to help someone who may not have the voice.”
Melania Trump praised all awardees, calling them “testaments to the power of love in action” and said their efforts inspire progress for all humanity.
Major Iga’s tireless work has not only supported survivors but also influenced systemic change in PNG’s legal and social systems, ensuring better protection for vulnerable groups.
She joins an esteemed group of global advocates, including honorees from South Sudan, Israel, Burkina Faso, and the Philippines. All awardees were nominated by U.S. embassies and selected through a rigorous process.
The International Women of Courage Award, now in its 19th year, was established by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to honor women who demonstrate exceptional bravery and leadership, often at great personal risk.
Major Iga’s recognition places Papua New Guinea on the global stage—shining a light on her relentless fight for justice, dignity, and human rights."
PM Marape commends Speaker for adhering to Court’s ruling,8/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3916,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed today’s special sitting of Parliament, commending the Speaker and Members of Parliament for complying with the Supreme Court’s directive and setting a strong precedent for future leaders of Papua New Guinea.
Marape acknowledged that today’s sitting was convened under the direction of the Supreme Court and with the leadership of the Speaker, demonstrating respect for the rule of law and the supremacy of the Constitution.
“Parliament convened today not by defying the Court, but by upholding it. I commend the Speaker for allowing the sitting to proceed in compliance with the Court’s order.
“This moment stands as an important reminder that no one – including Members of Parliament – is above the law,” Marape said.
The Prime Minister reflected on the events of 2011, when a previous Parliament failed to honour a Supreme Court ruling that restored the government of the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Thomas Somare.
“We must never repeat the mistakes of 2011. Back then, Members of Parliament took actions that undermined the authority of the Supreme Court and eroded our democratic principles. Laws were passed that, in some instances, made the father of our nation a stranger in his own Parliament. That must never happen again,” he said.
Marape stressed that in a country as politically, culturally and economically diverse as Papua New Guinea, leaders must be seen to uphold the law.
“The Courts interpret the law. Parliament legislates. Each institution has its place in our democracy, and when the Supreme Court speaks, we must comply. If there are uncertainties, the law provides avenues for appeal and clarification. But we do not defy the Court – we honour it.”"

The reports were handed over to DIRD Secretary Aihi Vaki, who praised the team for their timely and transparent submission.
Koka emphasised that the acquittals reflect the district’s commitment to accountability and transparency in public fund management.
He highlighted that the reports cover major infrastructure developments, improvements in education and healthcare, law and order, and socio-economic initiatives.
“These acquittals showcase our efforts to deliver tangible outcomes for our people, especially those in remote communities,” said Koka.
DIRD Secretary Vaki commended the district’s efforts, encouraging other districts to do the same to ensure compliance under the Public Finance Management Act.
He noted that accurate financial reporting builds trust and ensures continued government support.

Criminal charges against Act NOW manager dismissed,8/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3915,,Politics,Joy,Nill,"The Waigani District Court on Monday struck out a criminal charge of identity theft against ACT NOW Campaign Manager, Eddie Tanago.
Presiding Magistrate Paul Puri Nii struck out the matter due to lack of evidence.
A prominent civil society advocate, Tanago was arrested and charged by police in December 2024 following a complaint made by the managing director of the PNG Forest Authority.
This was after ACT NOW had hosted a public seminar highlighting the abuse of Forest Clearing Authorities by foreign-owned logging companies who use the licences as a cover for large-scale illegal logging.
The charge against Tanago alleged that he had committed identity theft by reposting on social media an advertisement for an FM100 talk-back show where the Managing Director was due to appear and which included his photograph.
Tanago said he is delighted that the court has dismissed the charge against him and thanked his family and all those who have supported his fight for justice.
He has also expressed his gratitude to his lawyer, Carlos Tsora from Posman Kua Asi Lawyers.
Tanago said the criminal charge against him has only reinforced his determination to speak out against corruption, widespread illegal logging and the abuse of FCA licences.
He also says the criminal charge against him was a further example of the growing use of Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation (SLAPP) lawsuits in PNG.
SLAPP lawsuits are a misuse of the legal system by people in positions of power who want to silence their critics through intimidation and unwarranted but costly legal proceedings. While common in some overseas countries, SLAPPS have until recently been rare in PNG.
In 2024, ACT NOW was the victim of two civil SLAPP lawsuits brought by Malaysian logging companies trying to prevent the circulation of reports about their logging activities. Neither of those lawsuits was successful.
Tanago said the dismissal of the case against him is another win for freedom of speech and democracy in Papua New Guinea."
VoNC process underway,8/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3913,,Politics,Anticipation,"James Marape, Peter Ipatas, Sir Peter Ipatas","Prime Minister James Marape has confirmed that the process under Section 145(1)(b) of the Constitution is now in motion, with the Notice of the Motion of No Confidence tabled today.
“In accordance with the Constitution, Parliament will reconvene next Tuesday to deliberate on the Motion of No Confidence. This is democracy in action. I urge all citizens to respect the process and allow it to unfold without interference.”
The Prime Minister further appealed to all public servants to remain loyal to their duties and refrain from engaging in political commentary or activity.
“I urge all public servants: Keep your political views at home. When you report to work, be loyal to your role as a servant of the people. Remain productive. Historically, Motions of No Confidence have disrupted the public service.
We cannot allow that to happen again,” he said.
He cited the instability that plagued Papua New Guinea from 1975 to 2002, during which the average lifespan of a government was just two and a half years, leading to poor economic growth and a weakened public service.
“It wasn’t until the Organic Law on Political Parties and Candidates was introduced in 2001 that we experienced stability under the Somare Government. That gave our economy space to grow. We must not return to the instability of the past.”
Marape further reaffirmed his commitment to unity, the Constitution, and democratic values.
“As we move towards 2027, I urge all Papua New Guineans to respect our Constitution, our Courts, and the democratic process. If you have concerns, express them through your vote – not by undermining the institutions that hold our nation together.”
“Next week, either I or Sir Peter Ipatas will be Prime Minister. Regardless of the outcome, I call on the public service to stay focused, and on our people to remain united.”"
Magisterial services lack capacity,8/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3910,,Government,Frustration,Nill,"Papua New Guinea’s magisterial services lack the capacity to deliver, says the NCD Senior Provincial Magistrate Billy Pidu.
Pidu said this during the National Development Forum on law and order hosted by the Consultative Implementation and Monitoring Council recently.
He said the magisterial services lack capabilities in manpower, outdated laws that do not deliver service to the people, and funding constraints are some of the factors hindering progress of the magisterial services.
Pidu elaborated that the need for having more magistrates is a big factor, however, the process of employing more magistrates often is slow because lawyers have to undergo intensive training to be qualified before they are sworn in as magistrates. Training lawyers comes with funding, which the magisterial services often are unable to meet.
He said the need for effective ICT, such as the amendment of the electronic case management system, needs to be thoroughly looked into because the system is not functioning.
The Magistrate added that magisterial services play an important role in the law and justice sector, therefore, it must be properly funded and resourced to perform its duty."

Catholic Professional Society (CPS) President Paul Harricknen said that should there be a need to change the government, the leaders must consider changing the government.
He said the churches can only hope that the MPs do the right thing, exercise conscience vote and from their hearts for the good of the people and not for their political survival and expedience.
“They must vote honestly from their conscious and their hearts. If there is a need for a change in government, so be it. We can only hope and pray that our leaders do the best for the people.
“Our appeal to the MPs is that we have a national crisis that needs to be addressed through good leadership. Therefore, they must consider changing the government and choose the right leaders who will carry the country forward for the betterment of our people.

Country needs good people: MP,7/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3898,,Politics,Trust,"Rainbo Paita, Solen Loifa","Our country is in short supply of upstanding citizens.
Menyamya MP, Solen Loifa, encouraged students to learn as much as they can, and aim to be good leaders whose sole focus will be on serving their people.
Loifa, who is a first-time MP, hails from one of the most neglected rural districts of Morobe Province.
Through hard work and dedication, he managed to graduate with a degree in economics from the University of Papua New Guinea, and he is now developing his district as their political representative. He was able to achieve all these through education, and especially learning to be a better person.
Speaking at a number of education project launches and ground-breaking for Wau-Waria district on Friday, March 28th, Loifa encouraged students at the Grace Memorial Secondary School, in Wau, to not only learn as much as they can, but aim to be upstanding citizens.
“The government has invested in free education, and your political leader has also given funding to send you to school,” he told parents and students.
“Our country is crying for good men and good women. How are we going to identify people with good characters? When you come to school, learn how to be good men and women so that our country can be in good hands tomorrow.
“A lot of issues we are seeing in the country today are not because of shortage of manpower or a lack of educated people. It is because we need good men and good women. So, my challenge to you, young people, when you are in school and learning, aim to be good men and women that can change our communities for the better.”
The Menyamya MP and his counterpart from Finschhafen, Rainbo Paita, were invited to Wau-Waria to officiate at the opening of a new 4-in-1 Grace Memorial Secondary School teachers’ house, the opening of a new 4-in-1 classroom building for Wau Primary School and the groundbreaking of a new staff house for Grace Memorial, a new science lab, a new FODE Centre and a Technical and Vocational Education and Training Centre.
Despite being a district that is only two years old – after its separation from Bulolo in 2022 – Wau-Waria’s rapid growth in infrastructure, education and health has been attributed to its transparent and visionary political leadership."
Police reduce hired vehicle expense,7/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3900,,Government,Trust,John Rosso,"The Royal PNG Constabulary (RPNGC) has always been scrutinised on its excessive spending on hired vehicles, and the lack of transparency in payment to hired vehicle firms.
With the handing over of 45 new police vehicles to the Special Services Division on Saturday, April 5th, the Minister of Internal Security, Peter Tsiamalili Jnr, emphasised that almost K30 million is “being saved on hired vehicles”.
Speaking at Top Town Lae after the event, he described it as a “big save”, adding that the police department will continue with the re-fleeting, leading to another K30 million being saved.
In the next four years, the constabulary should have an excess of K120 million that could be spent on police accommodation instead.
“The lack of priority by past government has placed the police department in a position where they had no choice but to hire vehicles,” he stated.
“And because they couldn’t adequately replace vehicles at the start of every year, they used to get vehicles on credit, and then allow the national government, or Department of Finance, pay those hired vehicles at the end of the year. And it was too costly.”
Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, expressed similar sentiments, outlining that vehicles were hired out of necessity due to the lack of re-fleeting program for the police force.
“We have seen that issue and what we are doing now, to save cost, government has now budgeted to re-fleet,” said Rosso.
“We have to re-fleet nearly 800 vehicles in the RPNGC.
“We have already acquired 130 under the national government police department; 130 vehicles were delivered and distributed last year. This year, another 130 is being received, as you can see, the 45 vehicles that were distributed outside.
“Forty-one goes to the mobile squad in the highlands; they call them the Highlands Mobile Group and then the Northern Mobile Group. And then the New Guinea Islands Mobile Group. Those three mobile groups will have vehicle replacements and the Southern Mobile Group will have the vehicle replacement very soon.”
Rosso said the re-fleeting program will move on to general policing, the Criminal Investigation Division and other sectors of the police force until all fleet have been replaced.
This is similar to the manpower boost that the Constabulary is currently undergoing through recruitment and training exercises."
Biaru road blocked due to misunderstanding,7/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3896,,Politics,Fear,Nill,"A misunderstanding of the word “bypass” created a volatile situation at Biaru, in Morobe’s Wau-Waria district, on Saturday, April 5th.
Villagers of Wisini, in the Wau Rural LLG, were led to believe that the construction of a new bypass – away from Wara Biaru – would mean that they will miss out on government services and benefits that they are currently enjoying along the old district road.
In frustration, they prevented a convoy from the district headquarters, including media personnel, from continuing to a ground breaking program in Biaru that would see the construction of a number of road projects within the area. The proposed projects are Biaru Kunai-Taurins Road and Tori-Korua Road.
Their issue lies with the bypass, which is the 3km Biaru Kunai-Taurins Road.
The people of Ward 17, including their councillor, George Kaia, would not let the vehicles through until the local MP, Marsh Narewec, addresses their grievance.
About 25 minutes after the first convoy was stopped, Narewec arrived at Wisini and was quickly briefed by the district administrator and chief executive officer, John Orebut, on the situation.
“What are you all afraid of and you’re protesting about ‘no bypass’? the MP asked the group. “Who is this scared person in Wisini-Kasangare? You think this road will bypass you all? You already have a school here. Should I remove it and give it to someone else?
“We have plans to build a coffee factory in Kasangare; are we bypassing you? Small minds. Your leader, ‘Kumul blo speis’, knows,” he said, referring to a popular moniker given to him in relation to his technology company, Kumulsoft.
“That primary school will become a junior high school, and possibly a secondary school. Why would I waste resources to cut a new road to Kasangare? Is it for vehicles or people? We spent millions of Kina to build a road for vehicles to pass through. Do not be afraid. Services will reach you.”
Narewec and his team continued to their program, then returned to Wisini in the evening to listen to their concerns.
There, the Ward 17 leaders highlighted that the current road was built in 1986, and the people there have been enjoying its benefits since. The current population, which is over 3,000 people, are anxious that if the bypass starts at Kunai, everything will be rerouted to that area.
However, Narewec gave the assurance that services will still flow, and he berated the councillor for not consulting with the district about the bypass.
Wisini leaders have been given this week to give their response to the MP, who had initially planned for roadworks to begin today (Monday, April 7th).
Biaru consists of three wards; 17, 18 and 19."
NEC approves Korea model for rural development,7/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3890,,Government,Anticipation,"James Marape, John Rosso, Soroi Eoe","The Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs (DPLGA), Soroi Eoe has announced a landmark decision by the National Executive Council (NEC) to adopt Korea’s renowned Saemaul Undong (SMU) rural development model as a cornerstone of Papua New Guinea’s rural transformation strategy.
Following a successful 13-year pilot in the Eastern Highlands Province (EHP), the government has approved the expansion of the SMU model to five additional provinces, marking a significant step toward empowering rural communities and driving sustainable change across the nation.
The Saemaul Undong, or New Village Movement, is a proven community-driven development approach that propelled South Korea from one of the world’s poorest nations—an aid recipient in the aftermath of war—to a global economic powerhouse and donor country within 50 years. Launched in the 1970s, SMU transformed rural Korea by fostering a mindset of diligence, self-help, and cooperation, enabling communities to take ownership of their development. Today, PNG stands to benefit from this inspiring model as its seek to uplift its rural population and bridge the urban-rural divide.
Minister Eoe said this is more than a development program—it’s a mindset change.
“The Saemaul Undong model teaches us that real progress begins when our people take full ownership of their future. It’s about empowering communities to identify their needs, harness their resources, and work together for lasting change. After 13 years of piloting in the Eastern Highlands, we’ve seen its potential firsthand, and now we’re ready to take it nationwide,” he said.
By embracing SMU, PNG aims to replicate Korea’s success story, fostering self-reliance and collective action to improve livelihoods, infrastructure, and opportunities in rural areas. The model’s emphasis on community participation aligns with PNG’s vision of inclusive growth, where every citizen plays a role in building a stronger, more prosperous nation.
Minister Eoe extended heartfelt gratitude to the Marape/Rosso government for its visionary leadership and unwavering support in championing this initiative.
“On behalf of the people I wish to thank Prime Minister James Marape and Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso for their dedication to rural development and for recognizing the transformative power of the Saemaul Undong model. Their approval through the NEC paves the way for a new era of progress in our provinces,” he stressed.
This announcement builds upon PNG’s long-standing efforts to strengthen rural service delivery through community-driven development approaches.
DPLGA has been at the forefront of such transformative initiatives, including the Rural Service Delivery Project (RSDP), which has successfully demonstrated how communities can lead and sustain their own development through active participation and ownership.
Like the RSDP, the adoption of the SMU model reflects the government’s commitment to establishing effective mechanisms that reach rural populations, ensuring that development efforts are impactful and sustainable.
As PNG embarks on this ambitious expansion, the government will work closely with local leaders, communities, and international partners, including the Republic of Korea, to ensure the successful implementation of SMU.
Minister Eoe says this announcement is especially meaningful as it coincides with Papua New Guinea’s 50th Independence Anniversary.
“As the nation celebrates half a century of sovereignty, the adoption of the Saemaul Undong model symbolizes a renewed commitment to self-determination and nation-building.
“The golden jubilee of independence is not only a time to honor our past achievements but also a pivotal moment to chart an ambitious course for the future—one where empowered rural communities drive our National Vision of a smarter, stronger, healthier, wealthier, and more prosperous Papua New Guinea by 2050,” Minister Eoe concluded."

Nii issued this order today, after hearing submission on sentence from the defendant and the police prosecution.
It was alleged that on August 9th, 2023, between 2 pm and 3pm, police escorted Palme’s wife, Flora Singol, to the Vadavada settlement at the rental place to collect her belongings.
At the house, a policeman allegedly noticed that the property was turned into a mini penthouse with implements used for controlled substances connected in a way to cater to mass consumption of methamphetamine.
The prosecution submitted that the defendant pays the maximum penalty of K5,000 or six months imprisonment, due to the substance containing less than 10 grams.
The defendant has asked for the court's leniency due to the substance not being above 10 grams, and is categorized under simple possession due to it being weighted 0.2 grams.
“I considered both arguments and also considered the time taken in the administration of justice since the offence occurred in 2023.
“My opinion is that the offence of having in possession of controlled substance has been increasing lately in the force. Therefore, I will impose a tough penalty. Giving the maximum penalty of K5,000 and 6 months imprisonment. Six months will be suspended, but the K5,000 will be paid by the defendant. K2,500 will come out of the defendant's bail money. Therefore, the defendant will pay K2,500 as court fine within the period of two weeks, failure to do so may result in 6 months imprisonment,” Nii ordered."

When presenting the legal textbooks, the ICAC Executive Director Legal, Belinda Hughes, said the donation aims to boost the knowledge and capabilities of PNG’s legal fraternity.
“Resources are so important for legal practitioners, and it is very expensive to afford, so we are grateful to be a part of this donation,” she said.
Hughes said the New South Wales Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW DPP) has also expressed support in sharing video training materials, which will be made available at the end of this week.
“The videos consist of 80 training videos about money confiscation, asset recovery, and advocacy in general. It will be made available to other agencies such as the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, Office of Public Prosecutor, and the Department of Justice and Attorney General.
Hughes added that NSW DPP will be sending three lawyers over for training by August of this year to undertake training.

National and Supreme Court Registrar, Ian Augerea said the law and justice sector in PNG lacks adequate legal textbooks and legal training, so this support will assist the legal sector in this regard.
“I am thankful on behalf of not only the judiciary but the rest of the law and justice agencies. I will be inviting liberals from other organizations to come forward and share the distribution of these books.
“Books are important in terms of knowledge sharing, and I’m sure our lawyers will make good use of these books to guide their practice as legal officers of PNG’s law and justice sector,” Augerea said."

Member for Kompiam Ambum, Sir John Pundari in a statement said the leaders in the country have supported and elected Prime Minister James Marape numerous times through votes of no confidence.
Sir John said stability is crucial for the country right now as we only have two years to go before the National elections in 2027.
“With only two years left before the next general elections, it's essential to stand by Marape. The people will decide who they want as their next Prime Minister through the ballot box.
“As a senior brother to Marape, I'll prioritize my district's and the country's interests over personal interests, standing firm with Marape and offering advice whenever needed,” he said.
Sir John Pundari stated that any leader who aspires to change the current regime must be free of systemic corruption and thievery to eradicate corruption in the country; individuals who embody these same traits are particularly unfit for the office of the Prime Minister.
“Leaders with authoritarian tendencies, like Idi Amin of Uganda and Saddam Hussein of Iraq in their provinces or regions are unfit to govern a democratic nation like Papua New Guinea.
“Those who exploit conflicts for personal gain or rejoice in destruction and loss of life are faceless and unfit for public office.
“A leader who cannot unite their people for stability and peace, or unite fellow leaders from the same province, cannot effectively unite a country.
“True leadership requires authenticity, humility, and a willingness to prioritize citizens’ well-being.”"

“There is a lot of misconduct by the politicians, and it is the responsibility of the Ombudsman Commission to deal with those people, but they get away, so what is Ombudsman Commission doing?
“ICAC, on the other hand, was put to fight corruption, but we do not see corruption going down; it keeps increasing.
“The increase in crime and corruption are escalating and with the recent amendment of laws passed by the government, questions whether the RPNGC and Public Solicitors office are working to serve the people or are compromising with the politicians to amend these laws that are not in the interest of the people.
“These institutions belong to the people; therefore, the people have the right to question their accountability.
“These officers must understand and implement their powers, and that is to make thorough investigations when heard about a corruption information. They must not wait for complaints, rather, they must initiate their investigations,” he said.
Harricknen commented following the call made by Cardinal Sir John Ribat for the law enforcement agencies and institutions to investigate, charge, and prosecute MPs and public office holders who are caught in acts of corrupt practices, stealing, and misappropriation of public funds."
"Yangoru-Saussia, first district to establish National Court Services",6/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3881,,Government,Trust,Richard Maru,"In a historic moment on Friday, the 4th of April, the National Judiciary Staff Services (NJSS) and the Yangoru-Saussia District Development Authority (DDA) signed an Agreement to partner to build a National courthouse in the district headquarters of Yangoru-Saussia. This will make Yangoru-Saussia the first district in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to have a National Court House with a Resident Judge to be based in the district.
Both parties have agreed to partner and improve judicial services in the Yangoru-Saussia District and to extend the services to other districts in the Greater Sepik Region, including Maprik, Wosera-Gawi, Angoram, Ambunti-Drekikir, and Lumi and Nuku in Sandaun Province.
The project including the National Court House and the houses for the Judge, Magistrate and other judicial staff will be delivered at the cost of K10 million — counter funding of K5 million each by both parties.
The Minister for International Trade and Investment and Yangoru-Saussia MP Richard Maru said, “This is a historic achievement and partnership. I am pleased to announce that K5 million counterpart funding from the Yangoru-Saussia DDA is ready and will be immediately released as soon as Accounts are open next week.”
He further stated, “One of the biggest issues that has been raised in this country by the Law Society and the public is the lack of respect for the rule of law. This is because criminals are not brought to justice. To improve access to judicial services in our district, the Yangoru-Saussia DDA is investing K5 million. We are very keen to have a residential Judge to ensure that justice is dispensed to the Greater Sepik Region. These services will complement the Mobile Barracks which is about to be completed and the District Court which is already established in Yangoru Station.""
""This is a great step, and I thank the Chief Justice and his management for this historic partnership. We are extremely thankful that we have been trusted to be granted the first district in PNG's history to have a Resident National Court Judge. It is even more historical when this partnership is being announced in the 50th year of our Independence Anniversary.
“I want to assure the Chief Justice and his team and the Secretary for NJSS and his team that my DDA will go all out to support this very important project, not only with funding but we will allocate land to build the houses for the Judge, Magistrate and all the judiciary staff who will be based in the district,"" said Minister Maru.
""With the funding to be immediately made available, we expect NJSS to finalize the design, and we want to go out on tender as soon as practical for the entire project,"" added Minister Maru.
The Secretary for NJSS, Nichodemus Mosoro, on behalf of the NJSS, gave assurance to support the people of Yangoru-Saussia District with counter funding of K5 million for this project.
Secretary Mosoro said, “Having a permanent presence of a judicial officer, be it a judge or a magistrate, will streamline the whole criminal justice administration process.
“The rule of law is a key enabler for development to happen in that space.”
Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Magistrate Josephine Kilage on behalf of the Chief Magistrate thanked the district under Minister Maru’s leadership, stating, “In having this inclusive approach to developing the capacity of the judicial officers with both the higher court and lower court within your district, it shows that we will all be working together lock step to make sure that we deliver, the issues on the ground in terms of case dispensation. Thank you so much for the assistance given and the continued assistance given to the district court, not only today but in the two terms in office. And I thank you for that support, on behalf of the Chief Magistrate.”"
Heart screening program commences,6/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3882,,Health,Joy,Nill,"Operation Open Heart (OOH) Foundation has commenced its Provincial Paediatric Heart Patients Screening Program for the year, starting in Manus Province with 15 patients screened. Two have been identified to undergo heart surgery – one open heart and the other, closed heart.
Senior Paediatrician Dr Diana Olita from the National Department of Health says although thirty (30) patients were scheduled to undergo the screening, only fifteen were able to make it on time to meet the Children’s Heart Screening team this week.
The others have missed out due to bad weather conditions as it’s been raining for the past week, worsening the already poor road conditions.
The team returning from Manus on Wednesday, 2 April 2025, were met at the Jacksons Domestic Terminal by Air Niugini Chief Executive Officer Gary Seddon and Chief Commercial Officer David Glover, OOH Foundation staff, and Ambassadors from the Valley Hunters Rugby Union Football Club.
CEO Seddon underscored Air Niugini’s decade-long support for tor the work of the Foundation, stating, “We will do anything we can to make that program just a little bit more successful. And it remains our absolute pleasure to be involved and we will continue to do so.”
Air Niugini in 2024 commenced ticket sponsorship for the Children’s Heart Screening team. This support enabled the team to travel to ten provinces screening 725 children. Thirty-three (33) children have been identified as needing open heart surgery and are awaiting the visit of the Operation Open Heart team, while 25 children were identified as needing closed heart surgery.
Last year, only nine had closed heart surgery done. From the remaining sixteen, one was flown into Port Moresby last week Friday by Air Niugini to undergo the surgery through a commitment made by the airline to ensure that all these children travel to Port Moresby for treatment.
“We look forward to the 15 children to come down and have that operation,” Seddon stated.
Air Niugini Chief Commercial Officer David Glover added, “New lease of life for these children. Everybody deserves that second chance, and we’re happy to play our small part bringing them into Port Moresby for the operation.”
The Foundation’s Ambassadors from the Valley Hunters Rugby Union Football Club were also present. Willi Genia said, “We’re very privileged to establish a partnership with the (Operation) Open Heart Foundation. We are very much part of the initiative around pushing a healthy lifestyle and healthy living to prevent things like heart disease.”
Genia added that a gala dinner will be hosted on June 21st to raise funds for the Foundation.
“We’re very proud to be aligned with you guys (Foundation) and also with Air Niugini and all the good things you guys are doing as a part of the foundation. Very grateful to be here and be a part of it,” Genia said.
Next week, the Children’s Heart Screening team will travel to Tabubil, Western Province, to conduct heart screening."
PM responds to US tariff,5/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3872,,Business,Trust,James Marape,"While PNG respects the decision by the United States to impose a 10 per cent tariff on all Papua New Guinean exports into the American market, Prime Minister James Marape says PNG will look to other markets if the US market becomes more difficult due to this tariff.
Prime Minister Marape said today that the Government had been formally briefed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and recognises that the tariff imposition is a decision made under the current U.S. administration’s domestic trade priorities.
“As a sovereign nation, we respect the right of the United States Government to make trade policy decisions in accordance with its national interest,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“We have no issue with this development and do not intend to retaliate with counter tariffs, as others may have done. Instead, we reaffirm our long-standing commitment to free and fair trade.”
The Prime Minister said that Papua New Guinea values its bilateral relationship with the United States.
“The U.S. remains one of the world’s largest free-market democracies, and Papua New Guinea shares this worldview,” he said.
“We are a democratic nation that believes in rules-based international trade. While we reserve the right to protect our domestic industries when needed, in this instance, we will not respond with hostility or punitive measures.”
Prime Minister Marape noted that Papua New Guinea’s trade footprint is increasingly diversified, with strong and growing markets in Asia, Southeast Asia, the broader Pacific region, Japan, South Korea, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe.
“Our trading partners in Asia - including China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and others — have treated Papua New Guinea with respect, honour, and fairness,” he said.
“These are our closest neighbours and represent proximity markets that continue to offer growing opportunities for our producers.”
“We will continue to strengthen our trade relations in Asia and the Pacific, where our produce is welcomed. If the U.S. market becomes more difficult due to this tariff, we will simply redirect our goods to markets where there is mutual respect and no artificial barriers.”
The Prime Minister concluded by reiterating PNG’s openness to all partners, including the United States, but stated clearly that the country would act in its best interests without compromising its values.
“We remain open for trade, we remain a friend to all, and we will continue to stand by our principles of cooperation, respect, and economic diplomacy.”"
Sohe District acquits DSIP funds,5/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3871,,Government,Trust,Henry Amuli,"The Sohe District Development Authority submitted its acquittal report for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 fiscal years to the Department of Implementation and Rural Development (DIRD) in Port Moresby on Thursday 03rd April.
Sohe’s Member of Parliament, Henry Amuli while presenting the reports highlighted that the district was unable to implement major projects and submit reports for 2022 and 2023 on their due dates, due to leadership instability at the district.
Amuli said while he was battling election petitions, court ordered recounts, by-election and was out of office, former District CEO and District Finance Manager have both passed on, affecting the smooth operation of the administration.
He said the district now has in place a permanent District Finance Manager and an acting CEO who are providing administrative leadership and moving things forward.
Now that the district administration team is fully operational and the presentation of the two outstanding reports of 2022 and 2023 together with part of the 2024 report marks their commitment to drive things forward, Amuli explained.
He said part of 2024 funds were received in late December so the district will submit the reports at a later date once funding is expanded on projects.
Thus much of 2024 funding for project implementations were carried forward to 2025 and they will begin to implement major impact projects soon. These projects include upgrading of district roads and opening up new links, building school and health infrastructures, building sub-stations and relocating the district headquarter to Sohe from its current location within Popondetta District.
DIRD deputy secretary, Gordon Wafimbi commended Sohe District for successfully compiling its outstanding acquittals for 2022, 2023 and 2024 fiscal years.
He described Sohe as one of the district that is always compliant in terms of reporting and commended the Member for his strong political leadership on that."

Marape Gives Members Room to Reflect Before VONC,5/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3873,,Politics,Trust,"James Donald, James Marape, Peter Ipatas, Sir Peter Ipatas","Prime Minister James Marape left for Brisbane yesterday, April 4th 2025 and will spend the duration of the weekend there to attend a series of high-level engagements focused on strengthening Papua New Guinea’s partnerships in sports and education, while also providing Members of Parliament space to reflect freely ahead of the upcoming motion of no confidence.
Prime Minister Marape said his decision to travel is also intended to demonstrate respect for the democratic process and to avoid any perception of exerting undue influence on Members of Parliament.
“There is much political noise in the air, with accusations labelling me a control freak or a dictator,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“To respect the integrity of the process, I am deliberately stepping back from close proximity to Members of Parliament so that they can decide freely, without pressure, what is best for the country.”
He said this was not a time for campaigning, but for reflection and fair judgment.
“After six years as Prime Minister, I am placing my record before Parliament and stepping back. I’ve told my caucus, my coalition partners, and all Members of the Pangu Pati that I will not be actively present among them this week,” he said.
“Instead, I encourage them to assess both candidates fairly — myself, and the alternative presented by the Opposition,  Sir Peter Ipatas.”
The Prime Minister acknowledged Sir Peter as a senior and experienced leader, and emphasised that Members of Parliament must now exercise their judgment based on conscience and national interest.
During his visit, Prime Minister Marape will be the special guest of the Brisbane Broncos at this weekend’s NRL match against the Wests Tigers — a sign of growing interest in developing a deeper partnership with Papua New Guinea, especially in light of the incoming PNG-based NRL team.
“This is part of ongoing efforts to build strong working relationships in sport as we prepare to introduce our own team into the NRL,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“I’m honoured by the Broncos’ invitation and the opportunity to advance this important national initiative.”
He will also meet with officials from the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) this afternoon to discuss potential cooperation in education, research, and technology development.
“These meetings are vital for our ongoing nation-building efforts across sectors,” he said.
“While I’m away, I want to reaffirm that leadership is not about micromanagement. Contrary to political rhetoric, I trust my ministers and team to continue their duties. Since 2020, we’ve upheld open parliamentary processes during all motions of no confidence — with no lockdowns.”
The Prime Minister highlighted his government’s commitment to equitable service delivery.
“Contrary to some claims, we have been fair to all MPs — both in Government and Opposition. DSIP and PSIP funds have been distributed without bias. A good example is Hon. James Donald, who opened a new terminal funded from DSIP allocations my government approved.”
He reaffirmed that he will return early next week but may also take additional time away once the motion is formally placed on notice.
“I value taking short periods of reflection during moments of political pressure. It helps me reset and return focused. More importantly, I want the country to know that Members of Parliament are making their own choices, freely and in good faith.”"
PNGDF ATW makes progress on international stage,4/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3861,,Military,Trust,Nill,"The Papua New Guinea Defence Force Air Transport Wing welcomed back its aircraft to Port Moresby on Wednesday following two weeks of training and participation at the 2025 Air show in Victoria, Australia.
This year, the PNGDF Air Transport Wing (ATW) contingent, comprising 11 pilots and engineers, flew down to Avalon with the PAC750XL aircraft to display its tactical lift capabilities.
PNGDF ATW, in partnership with the Royal Australian Air Force under the Flight of Excellence program, attended the Air show and displayed a well-rounded set of skills in the airspace, landing an award for being the Best Tanker/Transport Aircraft.
This event, being one of the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, includes static aircraft exhibitions, breathtaking aerial displays, and industry-related conferences showcasing both military and civilian aircraft from countries around the world.
ATW Commanding Officer Lt. Colonel Douglas Vavar was present to welcome the crew.
Vavar expressed deep satisfaction to the crew for presenting the PNGDF and the people of PNG on the international stage.
“The platform is for training purposes and also forms the foundation for our safety framework and other capabilities of the force,” Vavar said.
ATW Detachment Commander, Captain Cameron Hosea, who led a team of nine PNGDF personnel including Australian Airforce, said they have learnt a lot from the training and also gained a lot of experience.
Hosea said the main challenge they faced was to learn how to fly big military plans.
However, the biggest contribution they imparted to their Australian counterpart was on how to fly in the rugged settings as contries like Australia do not have rugged terrains like Papua New Guinea.
“Flying in and around terrains is what a lot of air force members do not experience as much as we do. They were keen to learn from our experiences flying in PNG, and we were keen to learn from them,” Hosea added."
Unveiling of Bong’s aircraft,3/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3858,,History,Trust,Nill,"The unveiling of a museum display on American ace Richard Bong, who flew in PNG in World War II, finally had his P-38J aircraft discovered in Madang Province last year.
The display donated by Pacific Wrecks and the Richard I. Bong Veterans Heritage Centre will now be officially seen soon at the National Museum and Arts Gallery in Port Moresby.
Richard Bong who was part of the United States Army Air Force, was America’s highest scoring ace fighter pilot of World War I, with a credit of 40 aerial victories and had most of his air combat taking place in the skies of PNG.
In 1944, Bing returned to New Guinea, flying from Nadzab and was assigned a new P-38J, which was nicknamed Marge after his girlfriend.
“Well, Richard was a famous pilot, and he scored three of his 40 aerial victories flying that airplane here in the skies over PNG. But the plane was piloted by another pilot, another American named Thomas Malone, and during his mission on March 24, 1944, the plane had mechanical issues, electrical issues, and the pilot tried to fix it, but he couldn't, so he bailed out in a parachute.
“He landed safely, was helped, and found the American soldiers nearby, was rescued, but the plane without a pilot, spun and crashed into the jungle, and it was forgotten, just like so many other wrecks and relics from World War Two, Papua New Guinea is littered with them, but this airplane has a very important history. It's connected to the most famous pilot, Richard Bong, and it's still here today in Madang province,” said Justin Taylan, founder of Pacific Wrecks.
The display is donated by Pacific Wrecks and the Richard I. Bong Veterans Heritage Center. The National Museum and Art Gallery acknowledged the partnership and its significance in the museum.
“This museum also has a partnership with the Government of Madang and finding these kinds of things, tells the historical relic and tells an important piece of history and the museum has a responsibility to bring awareness to the World War II, so we protect them. These also bring benefits like education, history and more,” said Alois Kuaso, Acting director of NMAG.
Parts of Bong’s aircraft will be brought to the museum from Madang Rai Coast and the display of the aircraft will be open for public display in a few months."
Court dismissed allegations against Bernal No.8 director,3/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3853,,Business,Joy,Nill,"The Waigani Committal Court on Tuesday, April 1st, 2025, dismissed the allegations against the Managing Director of Bernal No.8 Limited, a developer of Graceville Estate due to lack of evidence.
Wesley Yanum 42 years old from Makendo village in Angoram of East Sepik Province was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud, one count of forgery and two counts of uttering.
Yannum employed over 200 Papua New Guineas, whose jobs were affected due to the court proceedings.  Now that the proceedings are over, is a satisfaction to these employees.
It was before the court that on February 21st, 2011, Bernal No.8, the developer company of Graceville Estate at 9 Mile in the nation's capital, was incorporated under the Companies Act with the Investment Promotion Authority (IPA). The core function of the business is real estate and property development.
Police alleged that the defendant and the complainant were the directors/shareholders of the company with 50 percent shares each. Both have a joint bank account.
Police alleged that on or around June 20th, 2023, the defendant falsely pretended to Daniel Mwadeda, a company examiner of IPA, that he was the sole director of the company. In the process, the defendant convinced and instructed the IPA officer to remove the complainant as the shareholder.
The company was re-registered without the complainants' particulars on the IPA records. Police alleged that the defendant's conduct was criminal, and subsequently, he was arrested and charged.
The issue before the court was to establish whether police evidence was satisfactory to make a prima facie case against the defendant for the four allegations against him. Prima facie in law means that based on initial evidence, a case or claim appears to be valid and sufficient unless rebutted by contrary evidence.
The defense submitted that there is no record of interview in the court file that the defendant was formally arrested and charged for the offences, and asked the court for the allegations before the court is defective.
Prosecution, while responding to the defense submission, says all information is in order and the charges are appropriate and hence asked the court to commit the defendant since evidence is water tight.
When making his ruling, presiding magistrate Paul Puri Nii said there was no fraud or illegality at the time when the registration charges were effected by IPA.
“However, if the witness had misguided or accidently accepted illegal documents to effect the registration but found out later after when the charges had been made then it is in my view that the witness should be the master of his tongue tied and therefore his disappointment should not be hauled to the defendant.
“Thus, there is no prima facie evidence sustaining all the four charges against the defendant, therefore, the charges against the defendant are dismissed,” Nii added.
Outside court Yannum said his employees has been without jobs for almost a year due to the court proceedings, and now that the case is dismissed, it will open the door for business to continue.
“I thanked the judiciary for upholding the rule of law and justice for Papua New Guinea citizens who are very hard working. We are now relieved with the court’s decision,” Yannum said."
Continuous flooding a threat to livestock,3/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3854,,Business,Fear,Nill,"The continuous heavy rain in Port Moresby and the outskirts of the city, including the Central Province, is a threat to livestock. The Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) has raised great concerns.
The LDC is appealing to the Works Department and the NCDC to promptly address a river blockage caused by debris flow from an old bridge that connects the Kinakon Road, located behind the Tiaba abattoir at 12mile just outside Port Moresby.
Managing Director Terry Koim said further flooding caused by the debris flow induced a river behind the property, posing potential risk to human and livestock livelihood, including negative impact on grazing grounds and property fencing caused by landslide triggered by flood waters and friction from large debris.
“Debris flow-induced river blockage can cause flooding which poses a threat to the health of people and animals and can increase the risk of contracting waterborne diseases, whilst ruining crops and or removing and or contaminating valuable topsoil and cause death of livestock,” he said.
Koim said there are more than 100 cattle at Tiaba being fattened for the slaughterhouse, and it is important that their grazing paddock is in good condition and has appropriate food sources to have healthy cattle that will produce good beef.
He revealed that the flooding has destroyed the grazing paddocks previously assigned to plant signal grass (‘popular forage grass, known for its vigorous growth and ability to spread quickly’) which is deemed suitable for being well-adapted to acid and neutral soils, tolerating high soil aluminum levels, and maintaining green leaf well into seasonally dry periods, making it a productive pasture for beef-grazing and finishing.
“However, after the flooding, the cattle are being forced to graze on para grass, a grass type that spreads quickly and has much unpalatable matter compared to signal grass,” he said.
“Livestock is an important agenda that has the potential to bring back so much revenue that is spent. About K900 million is spent annually, but we now have an opportunity to change this by doing downstream processing to cut down on this expenditure, hence, this matter must be dealt with accordingly.”
Koim said, after close observation and inspection, the continuous heavy rains will only add to the already growing accumulated debris and huge logs at the foot of the old bridge that now not only stands as a rotting structure and eye sore, but also as a great hazard to all livelihood in the area.
At the moment, LCD is closely monitoring the situation, as the water level has slowly subsided, however, the swift action of concerned authorities is needed, as the weather remains unpredictable."
No money for LLG elections,3/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3859,,Politics,Fear,Jimmy Uguro,"With only three weeks to go before the Issue of Writs and Nominations open for the 2025 Local Level Government Elections, there is still no funding given to the Madang provincial electoral office.
The provincial election manager, Sponsa Navi, said the funding would be used for logistics and support to carry out the elections on the dates set by the Papua New Guinea Electoral Commission.
All the LLG data update has been completed with polling schedules, appointment of Returning Officials done which will be gazetted shortly and the common roll is ready as preparations wind down to await the next phase of conducting the elections.
Mr. Navi is calling on the government to fund the electoral commission so that they can receive their allocation amount to run the LLG elections. He stressed that they could not afford to delay the LLG elections again.
He said Madang needs K3.7 million, which has been submitted to the Electoral Commission. Mr. Navi states that they have also sent an additional K2.1 million submission to the Madang Provincial Government for counter funding, which is currently with the Provincial Executive Committee for endorsement.
Furthermore, there is outstanding allowances not being paid to three LLGs from last year’s common roll update, which has led them to withhold their data. Gama from the Usino Bundi, Transgogol in Ambenob and Yawar LLG in the Bogia district have withheld their data updates until payment is processed, in order to release the information to Electoral Commission.
In addition, the Madang Electoral Office is also anticipating an additional K5.3 million jointly run the By-Election for Usino Bundi district after the passing of member and Minister for Education Jimmy Uguro. Mr. Navi is requesting that money be made available so that, if need be, both elections can be carried out, killing two birds with one stone.

Unexploded bomb discovered in attempted arson,3/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3851,,Crime,Fear,Nill,"In an incident, Madang police successfully removed an unexploded ordnance (UXO) bomb that was found in front of a Chinese-owned shop at the Lae Builders Company (LBC) area.
Provincial Police Commander Robert Baim said this discovery follows an attempted arson attack that occurred in the early hours of April 1st, 2025.
As to police reports, unknown individuals, believed to be from a nearby settlement, placed the UXO inside three stacked tires and attempted to ignite them, presumably aiming to cause an explosion. Fortunately for the store owner, the bomb did not detonate.
The alarming situation came to light when a vigilant security guard and a resident noticed smoke emanating from the area around 6:00 am. They acted quickly to extinguish the fire and subsequently alerted local authorities, potentially averting a catastrophic event.
Acting Superintendent Robert Baim confirmed the gravity of the situation, stating that had the bomb exploded, it could have caused extensive destruction within a radius of 100-150 meters, threatening nearby businesses, residential areas, and passing pedestrians. The potential for injury or loss of life was significant, underscoring the serious nature of the threat.
“This was a serious threat to public safety,” Baim said.
He praised the swift response of the security personnel and residents, emphasizing that their quick actions prevented what could have been a devastating incident for the community.
Following the initial response, the Madang Criminal Investigation Division (CID) and the Transnational Crime Unit cordoned off the crime scene. They requested assistance from various joint security agencies to manage the situation effectively.
The PNG Defence Force Lae-based Engineering Battalion, along with the Provincial Disaster Office and Provincial Fisheries Division, intervened to safely remove the UXO.
Upon assessment by experts from PNGDF, the UXO was identified as a 105mm high-explosive projectile. This type of ordnance is known for its hazardous fragmentation radius of up to 150 meters, with a dangerous fragmentation range extending as far as 1300 meters.
Given the substantial risks involved, the bomb was carefully transported in sandbags to the Provincial Fisheries Base at Rooke’s Marina, where it was ultimately taken 25 kilometers out to sea for safe disposal.
In the wake of this incident, police have launched a comprehensive investigation and have identified possible suspects connected to the attempted arson. Authorities have indicated that those involved could face serious charges under the newly implemented Counter-Terrorism Act, which aims to address such threats more rigorously.
“Madang is too small to play hide and seek; we will catch up with you soon, so you might as well surrender now. This act is classified as domestic terrorism,” Baim warned potential suspects.

Angoram needs increased budget allocation,3/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3849,,Politics,Anticipation,Salio Waipo,"The Angoram District Development Authority (ADDA) says it requires increased budget allocations to effectively meet the needs of its communities, especially in critical sectors such as education and health.
Angoram MP and chairman of the ADDA, Salio Waipo said this when presenting its 2024 Acquittals to the Department of Rural Development and Implementation from the District Service Improvement Program (DSIP) on Wednesday (March 2nd).
Mr Waipo underscored rural districts' persistent challenges in service delivery due to constrained funding.

“Despite the financial limitations, Angoram District continues to implement impactful projects that benefit our communities,” Minister Waipo stated.
“However, it is imperative that DIRD advocates for additional funding specifically designated for rural districts to enhance our service delivery capabilities.”
DIRD Secretary Ahi Vaki acknowledged the concerns raised by Minister Waipo and committed to discussing the issue with the appropriate ministers to highlight the pressing need for increased financial support for rural districts.

"Manning revealed 4,000 arrests made in 2024",3/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3846,,Crime,Fear,Nill,"The Commissioner of Police, David Manning, reveals that approximately 4,000 arrests occurred in 2024 for crimes committed throughout the country.
The 4,000 arrests double the number of arrests that occurred in 2022.
Commissioner Manning relieved this during the National Development Forum on Law and Order, hosted by the Consultative Implementation and Monitoring Council (CIMC), on Wednesday in Port Moresby.
He said the increased number of arrests is caused by social disorder, where Papua New Guineans are becoming more violent, involved in using drugs and other illicit activities.
Manning said the statistics call for the community to change their mindset and behaviors.
He said police contribute their part to maintain law and order, but it requires the participation of the community to help police implement law and order in the country.
Manning said the increased number of arrests is one of the many challenges the RPNGC faces.
He put forward some of the recommendations to the forum to better examine and implement.  Some of these recommendations include social changes, increasing youth population, urban drift, effective security forces, forensic science, biometric suspect identification, real-time surveillance of criminals, and geospatial mapping tools.
“I encourage this forum to examine our social challenges, youths, education, housing, population shifts, social changes as well as effective use of our security forces.
“As to our strategic approaches to law enforcement, we have discussed integration of technology and intellectual policing to participate and respond to crimes more effectively.
“Technological advancement such as forensic science, biometric suspect identification, real time surveillance of criminals and geospatial mapping tools are needed to curb crime,” Manning said.
Manning said the police force will continue to enforce its mandated role but requires the support of the community, private sector, developing partners, and the government to work with them in enforcing the rule of law in our community."

“What’s trying to be achieved is for RPNGC officers to achieve higher levels of education but primarily, help them with their career path,” said detective sgt Payton. “We look at this group, there’s a lot of future leaders that are amongst the study cadre.
“This is the group for this year and next year, when applications will open at the start of the year, and some people are completing three and four-year degrees so they’ll require ongoing assistance and other people are just starting off on their education journey.”
Lae metropolitan superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, applauded the partnership that is upskilling a good number of women in the Royal PNG Constabulary, as well as future leaders in law enforcement.
“We are fortunate to have them on board because if you look at how we conduct business, things have changed a lot,” said Kunyanban.
“The collection of data, understanding important management best practice application, which is contemporary, if you like. So, we would like to see a lot of training be emphasised on that perspective, and if you look at the batch that is currently undergoing the program, you will see most of them are taking management courses.”
Kunyanban welcomed the skills and knowledge that would be imparted on the participants through the respective diploma and degree courses they are undertaking at the Divine Word University and PNG University of Technology. This, in turn, would be a positive contribution to the Constabulary."

Unitech changes graduation venue,2/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3836,,Education,Anticipation,Nill,"The Papua New Guinea University of Technology will be hosting its 57th graduation ceremony at the Sir Ignatius Kilage indoor stadium in Lae, Morobe Province, on April 11th.
This is unlike previous years where the graduation is held at the main Taraka campus.
Registrar, Veronica Thomas, says the decision stands despite opposing views from a few graduands and students.
The decision was made following “negative experiences encountered over the past years”.
“Last year, graduands left the arena due to the heat, leaving a bad impression on our guests,” said Thomas.
“This has shown that the temporary arena on campus is no longer conducive and inappropriate to host the students, guests, and parents, due to tight spacing, poor ventilation and crowd control.
“The Council has taken the graduands’ actions and comments made by the students (in a students’ forum last year) seriously, and has, in its wisdom, resolved that the ceremony be held off campus, until a suitable facility is built on campus to host our graduation ceremonies.
“The move off campus will enhance the overall experience for our graduates and their guests. The graduands will be given two passes for their guests who will be seated comfortably within the arena to observe the ceremony, compared to the seating arrangements on campus.”
The registrar outlined that the university is collaborating with police to address security concerns, adding they believe the change in venue will greatly enrich the graduation experience for all involved."
Successful raid by Lae police,2/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3838,,Crime,Trust,Nill,"A successful raid by Lae police has seen them apprehend suspects and haul in an arsenal of weapons following an armed robbery at Tanam, along the Okuk Highway, on Tuesday, February 25th, 2025.
Lae’s National Crime Investigation Unit and Sector Response Unit worked together for a month to gather intelligence and bring the case to a close.
There was a sense of accomplishment and relief as the 17-man composite team, consisting of the National Crime Investigation Unit and Sector Response Unit, gathered this morning at the Somu Sigob Haus, along with the arsenal of weapons that were collected during their raids.
When applauding the team for their perseverance and dedication, Lae Metropolitan Superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, said this is the result of a month’s investigation into the identities and whereabouts of the eight armed suspects.
It was reported that the suspects had broken into the Homestate property at Tanam between 2am and 6am on Tuesday, February 25th.
Police reported that during the time of robbery, the suspects wore masks and were armed with a factory-made shotgun and several staple guns.
The eight suspects allegedly stole K800 in cash, a black company pistol and hijacked the company’s 5-door Landcruiser.
“These young police officers here have done a tremendous job,” said Kunyanban. “It’s not easy to obtain information to go after criminals, especially when the crime was committed and they had already escaped.
“It’s a bit complicated than doing a fraud case or straightforward case. Like, in a fraud case, you already have the perpetrator of a crime – of how they got money. But when you come to criminal matters, it’s quite hard. When they commit a crime and they go, you’ll depend very much on artificial intelligence – which was the key breakthrough – and then you have human intelligence.
“As a result, suspects were apprehended, they retrieved the firearm, the shotgun, the homemade guns and they also found a hand grenade. If they hadn’t retrieved this hand grenade, it would definitely be used in another crime.”
Aside from the weapons, 17 live ammunitions were seized, including an arrow gun with 26 arrows, a slingshot and three two-way radios.
Kunyanban said the suspects will be charged with break-and-enter and stealing, possession of unlicenced firearm, the unauthorised possession of an explosive and the unlawful use of a motor vehicle."
FAO launches National Forest Inventory Learning Journey,2/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3839,,Environment,Trust,Nill,"Forests across Asia and the Pacific region cover 740 million hectares, accounting for 18 percent of global forest cover.
These forests are not only critical for the livelihoods of more than 450 million people, but also play a critical economic role, with annual trade in primary forest products surpassing USD 90 billion. Amid the challenges posed by climate change and increasing pressure on natural resources, the need for accurate, national forest data has never been more urgent to inform sustainable policies and actions.
In this context, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has launched the “National Forest Inventory (NFI) Learning Journey” at a regional workshop in Bangkok, Thailand. This innovative, self-paced learning initiative aims to help Member Nations plan, implement, and analyse their national forest inventories. It provides ongoing access to valuable resources to improve forest data management systems and strengthen national capacities.
The launch event brought together forestry officials, technical experts, and institutional partners from 12 Member Nations in Asia and the Pacific region – Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam. Regional partners, including the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization (AFoCO), also participated.
“Forests are the lungs of our planet. Accurate, accessible, and transparent forest data tailored to national frameworks, allow countries to monitor ecosystems, track progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which is why National Forest Inventories (NFIs) are so important for collecting and analyzing this data for decision-making”, said Robert Simpson, Deputy Regional Representative, FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific.
“Reliable forest data empowers countries to take informed forest actions on the ground. It is critical that we empower those that have the responsibility to manage this precious resource, with the best available knowledge and technical solutions. By strengthening national capacities in forest monitoring, we are equipping nations with the tools they need to safeguard their forests and build a more resilient future,” noted Julian Fox, FAO Senior Forestry Officer.
This initiative is a collaborative effort, supported by key partners, including the Global Environment Facility (GEF) through the ""Building global capacity to increase transparency in the forest sector (CBIT-Forest)"" project, and the United Kingdom's Accelerating Innovative Monitoring for Forests (AIM4Forests) Initiative. These partnerships reflect FAO’s commitment to enhancing forest monitoring knowledge-sharing globally.
FAO’s Forestry Roadmap: From Vision to Action, 2024–31 underscores forests’ dual role in both protecting and restoring forests and driving productivity. The roadmap outlines strategic actions to guide sustainable forest management over the next decade, with a focus on science and innovation to scale up solutions.
FAO states that its efforts to enhance national forest monitoring systems (NFMSs) are critical for improving forest data transparency and advancing climate action in Asia and the Pacific region. As Member Nations continue to make strides in forest management, strengthening NFIs at the regional level is essential for providing consistent and accurate data. This, in turn, will help Member Nations meet their commitments to sustainable forest management, ecosystem health, and climate mitigation.
FAO encourages all relevant stakeholders—governments, forestry experts, researchers, and institutions—to explore the NFI Learning Journey and strengthen their national capacities in forest monitoring."
Jimjam health centre embraces EDEN,1/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3822,,Health,Trust,Nill,"Twenty-one community members of Jimjam Community Health Centre in Yawar Village of Rai Coast district were the first to graduate from a week-long training in rolling out the Effective Development Empowering the Nation (EDEN) program. The training is run by the Lutheran Health Services (LHS) for the Madang/Sepik region.
EDEN allows for communities to take ownership of their hygiene and health practices, avoiding preventable diseases and illnesses. It helps communities to be more aware of their surroundings and share ideas on how they can be able to manage their health with whatever resources their health facility is able to provide.
Trainings in the Madang/Sepik region began last year with Community Health Workers in Madang, and the East and West Sepik provinces. EDEN trainings are captured in four main pillars; Wholistic, Community Ownership, Development and Multiplication.
Sr. Rhondy Maso, Health Secretary for the Madang/Sepik region stated that their key priority is to work with communities, the government and LHS to ensure this program is a success. In addition, Sr. Maso said there must be government recognition, including the Madang Provincial Health Authority in support services.
Jimjam Health Centre in Rai Coast is the first to roll out EDEN. It can now source external donor funding to assist with implementation before an evaluation is carried out. The evaluation will involve an assessment of successes and challenges in order to prepare for 2026.
Fadok Matei, the Community Health Worker in charge of Jimjam health centre, commended the local community for building the health centre. The clinic was a community initiative. Matei said it was first built with thatched roofing and over the years, fundraising efforts gave the facility a permanent modern look with roofing irons. He said the Yawar people are a great example of resilience and self-sufficiency to other communities in Rai Coast.
Formerly known as the Healthy Island Concept, EDEN was not realized due to lack of commitment from relevant stakeholders. In 2014 EDEN was introduced to LHS, who have taken ownership, driving this concept under its Health Promotion Section in public health.
Sr. Maso said other health centres in the district will be undergoing the EDEN training in the coming weeks."

Marking the collaboration through the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on Wednesday 26 March, the Provincial Government, represented by Provincial Member Philip Undialu and RAA Chief Executive Officer Kim Rose Opiti, signed the agreement signaling the first phase to reviving the rural airstrips.
“Rural airstrips are basically the lifeline of the people living in our rural communities and it’s important we get to serve those that are in the rural communities because they represent at least more than 70 percent of our population of the country so it’s important we must be able to deliver services to those in the rural communities,” said Opiti.
Undialu said for many years, the focus of the provincial government and District Development Authorities (DDAs) have been on road conditions under the connect PNG program, however, the focus is shifting to cater for air transport needs.
“Over the years, we’ve been focusing on road; some areas we have reached, more areas need to be reached.
“We will commit to revive about fifteen airstrips; only few are operating and most have been neglected for a long time. Part of the reason is a lack of coordination between the responsible agencies, including the provincial government, DDAs, and others. Now, we are gathering ourselves to put our acts together. Collaborative effort in putting our resources together to get those airstrips revived,” said Undialu.
“Hela provincial government will commit money. We have a good working relationship with our DDAs, our rural members. We have done a few works together on the road. Now we are coming into the airstrip together.”
Twelve of the 15 airstrips are located in the Koroba-Lake Kopiago electorate, whose local Member of Parliament, William Bando, was also present for the signing of the MOA.
MP Bando commended the initiative of this program and is keen on seeing the work commence.
Furthermore, Undialu made a special mention, thanking the Mission Aviation Fellowship and church organizations in the province for filling the gaps not covered by the provincial government.
He said, “They’ve done a fantastic job over the years. And church organizations that are serving rural areas under difficult circumstances, they’re able to deliver where government cannot deliver. Our efforts will complement their efforts. We just want to commit that Hela Provincial Government and our DDAs are coming on board to support the RAA to help us revive the airstrips so that they serve our people better.”
In the meantime, the RAA clarified that the total cost of the investment will be revealed after it conducts surveys and develops a proper scope of work for each of the 15 airstrips."

The Lae Terminal upgrade included the installation of a bottom-loading facility to complement the existing top-loading rack. Together, this combination speeds the loading process and shortens delivery times from the Lae Terminal to its customers.
“This upgrade significantly reduces truck loading times, allowing more trucks to be loaded each day at the facility. Our customers reap the benefit of the enhanced availability of our high-quality fuel,” said Dinesh Sivasamboo, Chairman and Managing Director of ExxonMobil PNG Limited.
“Throughout its long history in PNG, Mobil has always been committed to implementing initiatives that will better serve our customers,” he continued.
“At our core, we are a PNG company with ExxonMobil’s unmatched global expertise and capabilities, and we continue to look for ways to strengthen and grow our business – and fuel stability – for Papua New Guinea.”
For more than a century, Mobil Oil New Guinea – through its network of terminals, branded retail service stations, and wholesale customers - has been committed to the country and its people and stands ready to continue to be the country’s most trusted and reliable supplier in the decades to come."

NRI on ways to address lawlessness,1/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3831,,Politics,Fear,Nill,"The rise in lawlessness in Papua New Guinea (PNG) threatens businesses, government properties, and the safety of the general public.
Besides straining the country's police force, the lawlessness also poses a critical risk to national security, economic growth, and the country's development.
The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) Development Plan acknowledges the shortage of police manpower and recognises the need to recruit more police officers. Meanwhile, the country's increasing population complicates the RPNGC's core role in providing effective policing nationwide.
In a recent paper, the Papua New Guinea National Research Institute (PNGNRI) in Spotlight Vol. 18, Issue 3, titled ""Strategies to Address Lawlessness and Strengthen Law and Order in Papua New Guinea"" by Joe Harry, examines PNG’s shortage of police personnel as a key factor hindering effective law enforcement and discusses actionable strategies for enhancing recruitment, training, and deployment efforts country.
To address this concern, the paper suggests the following actions should be taken to strengthen RPNGC's enforcement capabilities:
•	Invest in modern policing technology;
•	Establish public-private partnerships for law enforcement;
•	Initiate an effective crime stoppers program;
•	Set up additional police training colleges in each region;
•	Implement decentralized police recruitment;
•	Enhance the police support infrastructure;
•	Strengthen community-police relations;
•	Provide incentives and support for police officers.
Implementing these strategies requires a strong political will to address police manpower shortages in PNG.
The paper emphasizes that this is particularly essential for restoring law and order in both urban and rural areas, focusing more on rural places, where most of the country's population resides and where crime has recently escalated."

Among the dignitaries were representatives from the Governor’s Office, the Provincial Administrator’s Office, the Hagen Central District Administration, and the UN Migration Agency (IOM).

Through this collaboration, the community actively participated in identifying risks, setting priorities, and developing strategies to manage disasters more effectively. Farmers, women, youth, business owners, and other vulnerable groups all had a say in shaping the plan to ensure it meets the needs of everyone.
Kelua-2 Ward 3 is among the most disaster-prone areas in the province, facing frequent droughts, bushfires, strong winds, and road damage. The 2015 El Niño-induced drought had a severe impact, drying up water sources and increasing waterborne diseases, particularly among children and the elderly. In addition to these hazards, the ward has seen an increasing number of internally displaced people moving in from other parts of the Highlands, putting pressure on land, water, and essential services.
“This is a historic moment for our community,” said Kelua-2 Ward Councilor, David Kela.
“For years, we have struggled with disasters and limited resources. Now, with this plan, we have a clear path forward. Our top priority is ensuring access to clean water for the 5,000 residents and livestock that depend on it.”

•	Early warning systems and emergency response strategies
•	Infrastructure improvements, including access to clean water
•	Environmental conservation to reduce disaster risks
•	Economic opportunities for community members
•	Social cohesion programs to strengthen unity
The plan was officially endorsed by the Provincial Administrator, District CEO, Deputy District CEO, Provincial Disaster Coordinator, LLG President, Ward Councillor, and a community representative. Their signatures serve as a commitment to supporting the community in implementing the outlined projects.

He acknowledged that while all council wards are required to have development plans, many struggle due to funding limitations.
“Kelua-2 is leading the way, and IOM’s support in this initiative is invaluable,” he said.
The Western Highlands Provincial Government, through the Office of the Governor Wai Rapa, reaffirmed its commitment to making the plan operational. Similarly, the Hagen Central District Administration pledged to work with relevant stakeholders to implement the projects outlined in the plan.
IOM’s Chief of Mission, David Arnold, highlighted the importance of community-driven disaster risk management.
“Strengthening disaster preparedness at the community level is essential to building resilience and ensuring sustainable development. This plan empowers the people of Kelua-2 to take ownership of their future by integrating disaster risk reduction into their long-term development priorities.”
Local businessman and community leader, Maip, expressed his deep appreciation for the initiative:
“I am old now, and I have never seen anything like this in our community. This is the first of its kind. I encourage the youth to embrace this opportunity and support the activities in this plan.”
Similarly, community member Cecelia Paraka shared her thoughts, stating, “We are fortunate to have resources like homes and vehicles, but our biggest concern is the future of our children. This plan is about securing that future. We must all stand together and support these efforts.”

Committee confident in country’s democracy,28/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3774,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"The Permanent Parliamentary Committee on Communications has affirmed that the state of Papua New Guinea’s democracy is intact. This comes after the Royal Papua New Guinea invoked Section 16 of the Counter Terrorism Act, partially banning Facebook Monday this week.
The ban has been lifted, but not without criticism and public outcry all echoing sentiments of having their rights of freedom of speech infringed upon.
On Thursday 28 March, Police Commissioner David Manning, Chief Executive Officer of National Information & Communications Technology Authority (NICTA) Kila Gulo-Vui, and Secretary of the Department of Information, Communication and Technology Steven Matainaho were summoned by the Committee regarding their lack of coordination as demonstrated through their separate press statements following the ban.
Chairman of the Permanent Parliamentary Committee on Communications, Marsh Narewec, following the meeting with the concerned parties yesterday, assured the country that democracy remains vibrant and strong.
The Committee found that;
1.	The Committee noted that Anonymous users on Facebook were inciting threats and violence that triggered the police to invoke section 16 of the Counter Terrorism Act, the undertaking was lawful under the Counter – Terrorism As 2024.
2.	The Committee also found that there is no regulation or standard operating procedure to execute the new Counter – Terrorism Act. Because there was no regulation or standard operating procedure the NICTA CEO and ICT Minister were not aware of the shutdown. The Commissioner of Police was also under no obligation under the CTA to inform NICTA or DICT.
3.	The Committee found that the shutdown was a temporary restriction on mobile operators rather than a complete ban and there was no sophisticated technology used but a direction using the CTA by COP to mobile service providers to temporarily shut down Facebook on their network.
4.	The Committee noted that the proposed digital ID project and the Social Media policy under the DICT are the way forward to regulate Facebook but the project and the policy has been under funded up to now.
Committee Views and Directives;
1.	The Committee has directed the DICT Secretary to take charge of policy matters in the ICT sector by working with NICTA and RPNGC to come up with a Regulation for the Counter - Terrorist Act 2024 as way for executing the Act and Collaboration among different line agencies.
2.	The Committee has directed DICT to fast tract Digital ID Project and the Social Media Policy.
3.	The Committee has called upon the Treasury Department to release funding for the Digital ID project and the Social Media Policy as way to counter fake news, misinformation, cyber bullying, cyber harassment and cybercrime on the social media space.
4.	The Committee has called for the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Information Communication and Technology to fast-track PNG’s accession to the Budapest Convention on Cyber Crime by getting Cabinet approval and bringing the submission to the Parliament for endorsement in the next Parliament sitting in May.
Furthermore, the Committee has explicitly stated that it will not support any ban on social media including total ban or partial ban and urged that the responsible entities must find other means to regulate social media properly without impeding on free speech.
The Committee has called for the different agencies in the ICT sector to work in collaboration and have regular consultation.
The Committee emphasizes that they will continue to provide the oversight in the work of the line agencies including, Police Cyber - Crime Unit, NICTA and DICT and to make sure that the relevant laws are working for the people and not against them.
“We will closely monitor the execution of the Counter – Terrorist Act 2024 with respect to its enforcement in the Communications Space.”"

North Coast emerges from the darkness,27/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3771,,Local,Joy,Ramsey Pariwa,"Electricity will be restored to the North Coast region of Madang Province after four years of surviving on energy sources not powered by PNG Power Limited (PPL).
Thousands of people living along the north coast road, covering sections of Sumkar and Madang districts, were denied electricity by PPL until the Madang Provincial Government intervened recently with a cheque of K24,500 to PPL to restore power supply lines.
Governor Ramsey Pariwa responded to a letter from PPL Madang  requesting assistance in restoiring electricity to the area.
Apart from power restoration to the north coast, Governor Pariwa has indicated he will see that electricity connection goes as far as Malala Secondary school in Bogia District. He said this plan is captured in this year’s budget for rural electrification in the province.

Provinces to be linked,27/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3763,,Infrastructure,Anticipation,Solan Mirisim,"The three provinces of Morobe, Central and Northern will soon be connected.
This follows the ground breaking of the Waria-Goilala Highway on Tuesday, March 25th together with ongoing works on the Morobe Northern Highway.
The people of Garaina, in Morobe Province, and Goilala, in Central Province, are isolated from the rest of the country due to no road accessibility.
On Tuesday, March 25th, Member for Wau-Waria, Marsh Narewec led a delegation to Bapi village, in the Garaina Valley, to do groundbreaking for pilot tracks to continue for the Morobe Northern Highway.
From Bapi they got on a chopper and continued to the Sumu Airstrip for the ground breaking of the Waria-Goilala Highway.
“There are three missing links being constructed on the particular corridor; from Morobe coming in to Southern corridor,” outlined Works Secretary, Gibson Holemba, after their trip to Wau-Waria.
“We have one coming from Bulolo to Menyamya, down to Epo in Gulf. That other one that we just recently opened is from Waria coming in to Goilala then we have the other missing link, which is from Waria to Bapi; we just launched. And then, the other one is from Bapi all the way down to Simkira; a village in Sohe district (Northern Province).
“These are the three main missing links connecting Momase into Southern region.
“The scope of the work is basically, doing pilot tracks ahead then we have the next team who are doing re-graveling and widening the road. Also, building some culverts and drainage at the same time.
“We are targeting to connect Menyamya to Gulf by June of this year, before 16th September. We are also targeting to reach Garaina Station before 16th of September. And we are also targeting to reach the first village of Goilala before 16th of September.”
The Government gave K9 million in 2023 for the Morobe Northern Highway and the Waria-Goilala Highway, while an additional K5 million was allocated from the Wafi-Golpu infrastructure development grant, and K3 million from the Wau-Waria district infrastructure funds.
K10 million was budgeted under Connect PNG in 2024 but only K3 million was received, while Wau-Waria added another K2 million.
This year, the district has budgeted K2 million and has applied for another K10 million from Connect PNG.
Wau-Waria MP, Marsh Narewec, says funding is yet to be approved. That was why he had invited the Works Minister, Solan Mirisim, to accompany him to Bapi to see for himself the people’s need for accessibility, and push for funding approval.
He described the initiative as “transformative” saying “The proposed Morobe Northern Highway will bridge Wau in Morobe Province to Popondetta in Oro Province, extending further to Abau in Central Province.”"
Court ordered peace ceremony observed,27/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3770,,Local,Trust,Nill,"Further to formally apologizing to Dr Jimmy Aipit, Constable Greg Wii also paid to Dr. Jimmy Aipit and his family, the Regina Avenue community and the Engan community in Madang province as part of the court orders issued to him on the 18th of February 2025 by the Madang district court.
During the trial session, Mr. Wii pleaded guilty and requested for compensation to show his remorse to the Aipit and Engan community. In concluding the case, Magistrate Kambibel upheld Wii’s submission in his summary ruling and asked Constable Wii to ensure that a peace ceremony should be conducted.
Within the conditional orders issued under Section 165 of the District Court Act, it was specified that, on the 24th March:
•	2x life pigs to be given to the Aipit family and Engan/Regina Avenue communities
•	K1, 000 in kind (Garden food)

•	2x life cows and a pig
•	K1, 000 garden food
•	K12, 600 cash
Officer in Charge of Town police station Senior Sergeant, Steven Etna stated that as remorse for their colleague’s actions, the police in Madang stood in solidarity to uphold the court orders. Sergeant Etna emphasized about their duty to serve and protect the people of Madang, lives and properties regardless of status, ethnicity or religion and said what had happened was unfortunate.
On behalf of Constable Wii’s family, elder brother William Wii Jnr thanked Dr. Aipit and his family for containing the situation and allowing police to do their work.
Representing the government sector and his ward area where the incident occurred, Town Mayor Peter Yalsy was appreciative of the court order in maintaining peace in the community by ensuring that this peace ceremony occurred. He stressed that since Dr. Aipit and Constable Wii reside in close proximity to each other, it was crucial that peace prevails.
Dr. Aipit in turn thanked the police officers and the Internal Investigation Unit in handling their case, however, was disappointed about a few things including a lack of trial. He added that there were so many other people affected including his wife and ‘haus girl’ who should have been specifically included in the order as well.
Furthermore, Dr. Aipit also enquired why Asila Security Services had not responded to his letter, as a number of their assailants came from there, apart from Constable Wii himself.
However, the prosecutor and mediator for the event, Senior Constable Eugene Wanai elaborated that any discussions should not deviate from the court orders and that his query can be pursued at a later date.
Despite him and his tribesmen having a few issues with the manner in which the compensation was done, they accepted what was given to uphold the court orders and maintain peace in the community."

“We’ve enjoyed democracy in our country for almost 50 years, and the democracy of this nation must be respected, and the rule of law must be respected.
“Papua New Guineans do not need the terrorism bill, the people need laws that benefit them.
“It's about time Papua New Guineans look at this law and tell your leaders this is wrong. Challenge your leaders.
Challenge your leaders in the provinces, challenge your leaders in the district, tell them that the changes you are making are not in the good interest of PNG.

It doesn’t look good when the ragged vehicles are lying there. If the vehicles are there and the investigators are not doing their job, please write to us so my office can check on the investigators and find out why they are not attending to you.

Officers from the Lae Metropolitan Command and the Morobe Provincial Police Headquarters started operations at dawn today, to maintain control in the industrial hub.
While some schools have closed for the day – for the safety of students – business houses and shops remain open.
Morobe Provincial Police Commander, Jacob Singura, directed men to “monitor and contain any gatherings in large numbers”.
“We are to ensure public safety and the protection of lives and properties. There will be no protests in our command and province as a whole.”
While the organiser of the purported March 26th ‘call for action’ remains anonymous, the widely circulated message outlined two main factors behind the protest:
1.	Limiting the Vote of No Confidence; and
2.	The recent Facebook shutdown in PNG
However, police have emphasised that authorisation was not sought for the proposed public gathering, while the nation needs to remember what had transpired in the last protest that was held in January 10, 2024.
Lae residents were reminded of how Lae police had swifty and effectively responded to the January 11th, 2024, attempted riot; a spillover from the Port Moresby violence and looting on January 10th, 2024.

Madang mayor assists self-help project,26/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3752,,Community,Trust,Nill,"The Ward 08 youths of Madang Urban Local Level Government have taken it on themselves to fix the dilapidated jetty at the DCA Boat Stop after witnessing the rundown state it was in and how boats were dropping of mothers and children at unsafe locations.
Madang is a province surrounded by islands, scattered off the mainland, especially within the Madang Urban LLG. In other areas of the mainland, there are access points along the coastline which boats use to pick up and drop off passengers instead of travelling on PMVs by road.
Many of these access points have long deteriorated due to agents of weathering, exacerbated by the effects of climate change. One of these access points is the DCA boat stop which accommodates more than a 1000 people daily from ward 08 all the way to ward 10. This area hosts the former timber company of Jant, Lutheran Shipping, Divine Word University residential areas, the settlements nearby and the working class renting within the area.
To their relief, Madang Town Mayor Peter Yalsy committed to assisting them and on Tuesday (25 March 2025), he purchased and delivered six cement bags to carry out foundational works on the already constructed frame and promised to deliver meshed wires later.
Mr. Yalsy praised the youths for the initiative.
Jacob Manu, a community leader of Ward 08 stated that at times when the weather is bad, they look for ideal spots to offload passengers. He added that mothers and the elderly sometimes have a hard time getting off the boats onto tree stumps or root areas. This has prompted the youths to seek ways in which they could rebuild the jetty from what was left.
He thanked the mayor for recognizing their efforts and expressed how this will impact the lives of ordinary Papua New Guineans.
Meantime, the same amount of bags and meshed wires will be given to the Jant boat stop as well."

Morobe Northern Highway project set for launch,25/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3728,,Infrastructure,Anticipation,"Sam Basil, William Samb","They have been neglected for decades, despite the Wau gold rush in the 1920s and the Garaina Tea Plantation in the 1960s.
Today (March 25th), Bapi village, in Wau-Waria’s Garaina Valley, will host a historic and ambitious Morobe Northern Highway project groundbreaking.
This missing road link will connect the people of Waria, Ono and Goilala to Wau, Lae and the Highlands Highway.
It was described as a dream that the late William Samb (former Goilala MP) and Sam Basil Snr (former Bulolo MP) once had; to connect their people to the main highways and facilitate the movement of fresh produce from the fertile soils of Goilala and Garaina to hoteliers and shops in the city.
Wau-Waria’s MP, Marsh Narewec, is taking the lead to connect the provinces of Morobe and Northern.
He described the initiative as “transformative”, saying: “The proposed Morobe Northern Highway will bridge Wau in Morobe Province to Popondetta in Oro Province, extending further to Abau in Central Province.
“Recognised as the ‘Northern Economic Corridor’ under the PNG Development Strategic Plan 2030, this vital infrastructure will traverse the rugged hinterlands of Biaru and Waria before descending into the fertile grasslands of the Garaina Valley.”
Narewec outlined that the project builds on the efforts of past Bulolo leaders; from the late Mathew Bendum to the late Sam Basil, who advanced the pilot track to Topai Mountain.
“The Wau Waria District Development Authority Works Unit recently extended this track to Bapi Village, overcoming formidable challenges posed by the terrain, weather, and the 100-kilometre distance from Wau Town,” outlined Narewec.
“While the District Works Unit continues to forge pilot tracks, contractors under the Connect PNG program, such as Tiare Construction, are upgrading these routes to rural Level 3 standard roads.”
The first-term MP has issued an invite to the people of Ono and Goilala to join him and his electorate at Bapi village tomorrow morning to conduct an official groundbreaking for the highway."

Facebook restriction in response to Terrorist Threats,25/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3743,,Politics,Fear,Timothy Masiu,"Police Commissioner, David Manning in a statement this afternoon announced that the temporary  restriction on Facebook was in response to ongoing efforts by criminals to incite violence against communities and damage critical infrastructure.
The Commissioner’s statement does not relate to his minister’s statement yesterday that the restriction on FB was to test the innovative technology designed to regulate the use of Facebook and other online platforms to mitigate hate speech, misinformation, pornography, and other detrimental content impacting Papua New Guinea.
Commissioner Manning said the restriction was ordered under the Counter-Terrorism Act 2024 and confirmed that the direction came following recent intelligence and investigations into communications on Facebook that were intended to harm innocent citizens.
“Over the past week there have been threats to incite terrorist actions, murder and ethnic clashes using Facebook as the main means of communication,” stated manning.
“This has included provocations that were published online through Facebook for individuals to use weapons and explosives to create fear and take lives.”
Police take these threats seriously, and this temporary restriction of a single social media platform is one component of ongoing counter-terrorism investigations and operations,” he further stated.
The Commissioner expressed his appreciation for  to the law abiding citizens.
“Under the strategic direction of the Executive Government, this operation is all about saving lives, preventing the escalation of tribal conflicts and killing, and stopping incitement to damage to hospitals, schools and buildings.”
He added that this operation is restricted to Facebook and does not affect other platforms, also indicating that investigators continue to monitor the activities of criminals.
Meantime, NICTA and ICT Minister Timothy Masiu both denied having any knowledge of the restriction of Facebook."
Media Council calls for transparency,25/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3738,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"“For the government to proceed to conduct tests of new technology on its citizens without their knowledge borders on political autocracy, and an abuse of human rights,” says the President of the Media Council of PNG, Neville Choi.
MCPNG is calling for more transparency amongst government agencies in consideration of matters directly impacting free speech and freedom of expression.
It also voiced its concern that government agencies can ‘test’ new technology on Papua New Guinean citizens in community spaces like social media, without any warning, and without consideration for the democratic principles of full disclosure and transparent governance.
This is about what the police minister has described as the testing of new technology to enhance law enforcement against the abuse of social media platforms.
Inquiries by MCPNG Member Newsrooms to the Department of Information and Communication Technology (DICT) and the National Information and Communication Authority (NICTA), and a media statement released around midnight last night by the latter clearly indicate that both these agencies who should be leading any public agenda on social media were completely unaware of what the police minister was referring to.
MCPNG Media Members were also very critical of the lack of urgency by government agencies to provide credible information to the mainstream media to counter growing misinformation amongst the public.
Choi described the Police Minister’s statement as “vague”.
“The police minister in his vague statement voiced a sense of accomplishment at what he refers to as the successful testing of technology capable of combatting the abuse of social media platforms in the country.
Speaking on behalf of MCPNG, Mr. Choi said for the RPNGC to test new technology without the knowledge of both NICTA and DICT is now pushing the boundaries of jurisdiction into the private spaces of citizens, and giving too much power to one person to decide what matters constitute threats to national security and justify such action."
Cynthia's journey in keeping the family art alive,25/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3739,,Culture,Joy,Nill,"As women across Papua New Guinea come together on 24th of March, 2025 to celebrate the National Women’s day in Port Moresby, a beautiful story of passion, family and craftmanship emerges.
At 39, Cynthia Mai’s journey is one of resilience, passion, and a deep connection to her roots.
She was born and raised in Wewak, East Sepik, where her story begins in a small coastal tow. Cynthia is one of eight siblings, four sisters and four brothers, all raised by parents who were both from Angoram, East Sepik.
Growing up, the values of family, culture, and creativity were instilled in her, thanks to parents who were deeply involved in designing arts, crafts, and the sale of ancient artifacts.
From an early age, Cynthia Mai was surrounded by the beauty of handmade artifacts, and it was here, within her family, that her inspiration and motivation first took root. She would watch her family members work with skill and pride, crafting objects that carried the rich heritage of their culture. This early exposure to the world of arts and crafts would lay the foundation for what would later become her passion and livelihood.
After completing her primary and high school education in Wewak, she ventured to Port Moresby, where she pursued her tertiary studies at Port Moresby Business College. In 2010, she earned her Diploma in Financial Accounting, a qualification that led her to work in formal employment at PNG Air Freights and later, East West Transport. For six years, Cynthia Mai worked diligently in these roles, including a position as a Customs Office Manager.
Despite the stability and opportunities in her formal career, she couldn’t shake the pull towards something more meaningful, something that resonated with her heart.
In 2015, after years in the corporate world, Cynthia Mai made a brave decision to step away from formal employment. It was a leap of faith, but one that was fueled by a deep desire to connect with her culture and family in a more authentic way.
The following year, she secured a space at the Tabari Crafts Market in Boroko, Port Moresby, and began weaving and selling her own handmade artifacts alongside her sisters. This was the beginning of her journey into the world of craftsmanship.
The transition from corporate work to becoming an entrepreneur in the world of design and crafts wasn’t easy, but it was undeniably fulfilling.
Cynthia Mai, with her sisters by her side, began creating beautiful, intricate pieces that reflected their heritage. Pieces that told stories of their ancestors and their lands. Moreover, they didn’t just create and sell their own artifacts; they also bought artifacts from Wewak and resold them in Port Moresby, helping preserve and share the art and culture of East Sepik with a wider audience."

Constable Wii and his four accomplices are facing seven charges for allegedly threatening, assaulting and discharging a firearm on the 17th of January, 2025.
Wii provided a formal apology to Dr Aipit and his family, the community of Regina Avenue and the Engan Community for inciting fear in the community.
“On the 16th of January 2025, I made a grave error in judgement. I pointed my firearm at a civilian, a situation that caught the attention of the nation. This was not only inappropriate; it was a violation of the trust you place in us as law enforcement officers. I am deeply sorry for the fear and distress that I caused. No one should feel threatened in their own community, especially by someone who is meant to ensure their safety. My actions were not reflective of the values we aim to upload as police officers,” Mr. Wii stated.
“To Dr. Jimmy Aipit and family, I am deeply sorry for my inappropriate actions and word. I regret the fear instilled and I hope to make amends. Your safety and dignity are paramount and I failed to uphold that in our interaction. I also want to extend my sincerest apologies to the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, Police Commissioner, Provincial Police Commander Madang, all the hard-working men and women in blue all across the county, my family and friends, civilians and colleagues that know me personally as a person and most of all, the general public of this great nation,” Mr. Wii further stated.
Officer in Charge of the Madang town police station, Steven Etna explained to those gathered during the peace ceremony that the event was conducted to fulfil the court orders of the summary offences. The committal proceeding will take place on the 27th March. Mr. Etna also highlighted the fact that the court cases are separate from his administrative decisions which will also come into play after court cases are done.
In addition, ACPfor Northern Command, Peter Guiness stated that times are changing and so police men and women need to show the public that they are trustworthy and can be counted on for protection. ACP Guiness also urged young recruits to work towards building confidence and trust within communities so that they can better assist police better."
Waigani Police pilot community policing initiative,25/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3734,,Local,Trust,Nill,"The Waigani Police Station has piloted a community policing initiative recently to create safer neighborhoods and strengthen relationships between law enforcement and residents in the community.
Through this initiative, the Waigani Police has encouraged citizens to actively participate in decision-making, problem-solving, and public safety activities. Community members will be involved in shaping the policing efforts in their areas, ensuring that law enforcement strategies reflect each neighborhood's unique needs and concerns.
This initiative is supported by the EU-PNG Partnership for Good Governance (P4GG), which is working alongside the RPNGC to strengthen community policing as part of broader efforts to enhance security, rule of law, and access to justice in Papua New Guinea. Through P4GG, supoort is being provided to equip police with the necessary skills and resources to foster trust and engagement with the communities they serve.
NCD/Central Divisional Commander Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi said, “Through this pilot project, we aim to focus on open communication, transparency, and proactive problem-solving. Our officers will be visible, accessible, and approachable, creating opportunities for meaningful interactions with residents. There are existing programs like the community watch programs in place which the police officers need to make themselves available to those in charge of those programs so they can work together. “
Key to this community policing initiative is the presence of dedicated community police officers who will build lasting relationships by being visible, engaging with residents regularly, and attending local meetings. These officers will not only patrol their designated areas but will also focus on open communication with the people they serve. By establishing trust and fostering cooperation, the community policing model aims to improve public safety and reduce fear of crime.
The Family and Sexual Violence Unit (FSVU) is an integral part of this initiative. Community members and police are encouraged to work together to spot early signs of crimes of this nature against children and women before they escalate.
RPNG’s Director FSV, Superintendent Delilah Sandeka said, “We all play a role in making our communities safer and ensuring that victims of family and sexual violence receive the justice and support they deserve.”
By promoting shared responsibility for public safety, the Waigani Police Station hopes to create a safer, more connected community where everyone feels valued, heard, and protected."

Paita replaces Wake Goi, who’s been moved to the Civil Aviation Ministry following Walter Schanaubelt’s resignation as minister, to return to the province to participate in the leadership vacuum left behind by the late Sir Julius Chan.
Prime Minister James Marape made these announcements early this morning en route to New Zealand for bilateral talks.
“I spoke to the Honourable Wake Goi last night, and I have moved him to the civil aviation sector to be focused more on rural airstrips to ensure that our rural PNG is connected by airstrips also, as well as linking up with key priority airports that need to be attended to - Wewak Airport and Terminal, Tokua Airport and Terminal, Buka Airport and Terminal, are three priorities for us, completing Madang Terminal, completing Wapenamanda Terminal, as well as focus on Kerema and Daru Airport. These were instructions passed to him last night for him to work in this space,” the Prime Minister said.
The transport portfolio, which was also held by Schnaubelt is now being assigned to Finance Minister Miki Kaeok as Goi takes on just the Civil Aviation portfolio.
The Prime Minister said as Paita takes up this new role as Mining Ministers., he will work to deliver outstanding agreements for mining projects around the country.
“He was specially tasked to deliver Porgera CDA completion, deliver Mine Development Contract for Wafi Golpu.
“Also, certain instructions were given to him to make sure the joint study, the joint feasibility study by Kumul Minral and Ramu MCC Nickel mine, the study on downstream processing is complete. I asked him also to have a review on the process that has facilitated some of the mine permits thus far, mine licenses that has been issued, especially Oro and Mount Kare, those were asked for him to look into, progress of Frieda mine, as well as a special word has gone out that the proposed gold refinery concept that has been floating be stayed until we relook at the concept in totality. So those were instructions passed to him. “
Paita has also been issued instructions to look at the new mining regime.
“He was also tasked to look at the new regime that we've been discussing and that has been in circulation. The new regime, I just want to say, will not compromise investors' return on investment. Investors will have their place to make profit, but at the same time there will be a special look in the country, getting back more from our resources.”
The Prime Minister is also expected to review the current cabinet on his return from New Zealand with some reshuffle expected.
“And as I come back, I intend also as part of the review in cabinet performance, we'll continue run next week when I return, and after that entire cabinet review. Some reshufflings will take place with other ministers being moved to portfolios that I feel they could be better utilised in as far as their talent and experience is concerned.”
Marape said these changes are all in an effort to progress the national agenda, adding that him and the deputy prime minister are “not here to warm seats” as the nation faces its 50th anniversary."

Marape testifies against Yafai,24/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3721,,Politics,Disgust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape when testifying today told the Court that former Deputy Secretary for Finance, Jacob Yafai had defied instructions issued to him and other senior finance officials to release funds to Paul Paraka Lawyers, as there was an instruction on foot to stop the payments.
The Prime Minister is listed as a state witness as the then Finance Minister when a K41 million was paid to the Paraka law firm.
According to Marape, on October 31st, 2012, an instruction through a memo was issued to Yafai and former Finance Secretary Steven Gibson to stop outstanding payments to the law firm. Marape is the author of the Memo.
However, when made known that the first payment of K14 million was paid on November 1st, 2021, Marape held a meeting with Yafai and Gibson, to explain why the instruction was superseded.
At that time Marape had written another instruction to stop outstanding payments to the law firm.  So, it was about two instructions made at that time by Marape to stop the payments.
Gibson and Yafai were suspended from office and instructed to provide a statement as to how this payment was made.
Marape said in Court that he was instructed by former Prime Minister Peter O’Neill who was the PM at that time to stop payments.
The lawyer representing Yafai told Marape that there is evidence put before the court that the payment made to the Paraka law firm was taken out of a trust account, which the finance department used to pay Paraka law firm.
In response, Marape said that despite the payments being made from the trust account or another account, the fact of the matter is that instructions were on foot to stop payments.
After completing his evidence, Marape apologise to the court for his absence on Wednesday, March 12th for not appearing in court due to the Parliament sitting.
Presiding Judge Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika accepted his apology and adjourned the matter to a later date.

The Mineral Resources Authority on Friday, March 21 2025, donated a 10-seater landcruiser vehicle and K45, 345.00 for school fee support to three Earth Science students.
In a small ceremony, witnessed by the Head of the Earth Science Department Associate Professor, Dr Joseph Espi, staff and students, the MRA Managing Director Jerry Garry, presented the keys of the vehicle to the Acting Vice Chancellor of the UPNG, Professor (Dr) Cecilia Nembou, and the school fees dummy cheque to the students.
Mr Garry said the MRA had been a strategic development partner of the Earth Science Department for a long time, and that the partnership would continue into the future.
He hoped that the new vehicle would be of great help and value to the school and students, especially in their field and research work.
“We want to give you that mobility so that you can go as far as you can, to see the different rock types in the field. And when you come back, try to recognise them, try to understand them. Because every piece of rock on earth is of use to mankind.”
Mr Garry said it was important that the MRA continued its support to the country’s future geoscientists, as they would contribute towards the sustainability of the mining sector in the future. He encouraged the students to start thinking about the sustainability of the mining sector of the country.
“When most of the current major mines, including Wafi-Golpu and the Frieda River Mine are closed by around 2060, the country would not have any new mines to continue to support the economy of the country.”
He said it was therefore important to support and prepare young geoscientists today so that they can meaningfully contribute towards the development of the mining sector in the future.
The students were encouraged to move away from conventional geoscience thinking and be innovative in their approach to deploying mining technology, to ensure the sector is sustained
Dr Nembou and Dr. Espi expressed gratitude towards the MRA for its donation and for being a strategic development partner for many years."

Hiritano highway needs immediate fixing,23/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3713,,Infrastructure,Anger,Peter Isoaimo,"Vice Minister for Works and Highways and Member for Kairuku, Peter Isoaimo, has expressed frustration over the failed rehabilitation works on the deteriorating road conditions along the Hiritano Highway.
“The highway, now riddled with massive potholes resembling volcanic craters, has become a death trap for motorists and commuters.”
On Saturday, March March 22, while on electoral duties, Isoaimo witnessed firsthand the bd road conditions and voiced his disappointment with the construction company responsible for the rehabilitation project.
He said the company, funded through the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program by the World Bank, was tasked with restoring the national highway from Vanapa to Bereina in Central Province. However, after digging up sections of the road nine months ago, the company ceased operations near Veimauri Bridge, leaving the highway in a perilous state.
Isoaimo said the neglected road has led to numerous accidents, including a tragic collision, witnessed by the MP last night (Saturday 22nd March) when returning from his electoral visits.
The accident, involving a Central Province Traffic Authority vehicle and a local PMV truck, resulted in multiple casualties and one fatality.
He said such incidents underscore the urgent need for immediate action to restore the highway and prevent further loss of life.
As Vice Minister for Works and National Highways, MP Isoaimo has vowed to escalate the issue, stating that he will bring the matter to the Minister for Works and Highways and the Department Secretary to ensure the road is repaired without further delay.
“The Hiritano Highway is a critical transport link for thousands of commuters, businesses, and communities in Central and Gulf provinces. The current condition not only poses a serious safety risk but also disrupts economic activities and essential services,” said Isoaimo."
Concerns raised about the delay of Porgera CDA,22/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3702,,Politics,Anger,"James Marape, Peter Ipatas, Sir Peter Ipatas","Two members of parliament from Enga have taken the government to task over the prolongment of the Porgera Community Development Agreement.
Member for Laigaip, Amos Akem sought answers on the 14th of March last week from the Mining Minister about this subject. Yesterday, Enga Governor Sir Peter Ipatas directed the same question to the Prime Minister.
Governor Ipatas was concerned that the people of Enga were not benefiting from the Porgera Mine despite its reopening more than a year ago and sought answers from the Prime Minister on when the Community Development Agreement process would be completed and the people there start receiving benefits.
“Most of the cake has been cut. Now, there’s a lot of expectations – people think that there’s more to cut. I think that the CDA needs to be signed up quickly. The mine has been operating for more than a year now and people are not benefiting,” Sir Ipatas said.
“That can cause little bit of tension and problems so Prime Minister, if you can tell the people of Enga, especially people of Porgera and those affected (the riverine people) when we can conclude this.”
Ipatas questions come following similar questions that were asked on the 14th of March by the Member for Laigaip, Amos Akem.
“Wanem taim tru Community Development Agreement blong Porgera bai pinis?” Akem asked the mining minister last week.
Prime Minister James Marape explained the delay in the CDA process.
Now in that discussion of royalty as well as equity, the other three impacted sister provinces and landowners have a view that they also are entitled to a little portion of royalty and equity and benefits.
This possibly is one of the reasons why Mineral Resource Authority has been working to find out where exactly, they make the conclusion to giving respect to Western Province, West Sepik Province, Hela Province as well as the upload of power lines from Hides to Porgera,” the Prime Minister highlighted.
However, assured the governor and the rest of Enga that he would have an answer for them when he visits Enga next week to open the new Provincial Hospital.
“Governor, I want to give you an assurance – as I come for the hospital program in Wabag on 31st, if I have the conclusion of CDA, we would indicate there. If it is not, then in the moth of April,” assured the Prime Minister.
He also assured the people of Porgera that resettlement remains his government’s priority and part of the CDA will include this."
Bando highlights ambitious plans for the coffee sector,22/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3703,,Business,Anticipation,William Bando,"The Coffee Ministry under the leadership of Minister William Bando is set to revolutionize the coffee sector to ensure funding reaches small holder and block holder coffee farmers.
Minister Bando revealed an ambitious plan where a Green Gold Card concept will be introduced to realize this.
K10 million kina has been earmarked for the coffee freight and price support initiative where farmers can access through the Green Gold Card concept.
When the coffee minister was asked today on the government’s commodity freight subsidy program, Coffee Minister William Bando was a little emotional as he described how farmers are not able to reach the markets due to dilapidated road conditions and went further to call on the government to prioritize these economic roads under the Connect PNG program.
“The epicenter of coffee is in Eastern Highlands and sometimes I tend to wonder, and the questions that are being asked on this floor, on the Connect PNG program that there are places in Eastern Highlands where 70 to 80 percent of our coffee come from, similarly to oil plam, to cocoa, to copra.
These are the places where we need to connect them up with roads. Connect PNG program funding is not a funding to connect one district to another within a province,” said Bando.
He also explained where the freight subsidy funds for commodity are being kept, saying this funding is with the Agriculture Department and his attempts to access these funds have been futile.
He then highlighted his ministry’s plans to introduce programs that will help farmers access funding for freight and price support.
“We will introduce what we call a Green Gold Card. That card operates on a similar way as the visitor arrival cards. When you go out of the country or any visitor that comes into the country, they complete a form called the “Arrival Form”. It’s the same principle but we will extend it to include the name of the village, the council ward, the LLG, the district and the province where that farmer is from. We will also include bank details of that particular farmer,” the minister outlined.
Every time a farmer sells coffee, whether ist green or dried beans to buyers, he/she fills out a form that will be put there by CIC. CIC then keeps all the data and will be able to identify who the real farmers, and provide them funding from the k10 million Price Support Money. He explained how this will work.
“Every month, that form will be remitted to CIC (Coffee Industry Corporation).
“That form will be lodged at CIC and CIC will enter it into a database that we’re developing. And at the end of each month, you get a print out of who is the real coffee farmer out there, that individual by name, by account details, by council ward, by LLG, by district and by province. So we as politicians, it’s a rare opportunity that’s been created by coffee that we can tap into the CIC system and then you get a print out every month and you will see who the coffee farmers are out there. And this can be emulated into oil palm, into cocoa and into copra.”
Bando described this as a paradigm shift and is certain this will work for the benefit of rural farmers."
Solar Innovation Enriching Lives,21/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3700,,Agriculture,Joy,Nill,"Deep in the lush green hills of Nambare in the East Sepik Province, Pastor Tania Parenduo and her husband Clement meticulously sort through cocoa beans in their six-by-five metre solar dryer shed.
As they work, the air is thick with the aroma of drying cocoa. For the couple, it is the smell of success.
For years they had dried their cocoa by heating the beans above a woodfired kiln. It was hot and labour-intensive work, constantly gathering firewood and monitoring the process. And there was the ever-present risk that woodsmoke would taint the drying cocoa, slashing its value in the market.
The solar dryer shed, provided through a partnership between the Australian Government and cocoa exporter Outspan Limited, has changed all that. Now they can dry their cocoa with much less effort and expense, and with much better results in terms of quality. Pastor Tania says having the solar dryer has dramatically improved their lives.
A lift in the quality of the cocoa they sell, combined with soaring global prices, it has substantially boosted the family’s weekly income, benefiting not only them but their community as well.
In addition to being a farmer, Pastor Tania is a community leader, and the extra income has enabled the couple to build a women’s resource centre, an early learning facility for children and a church for their community.
The tuition fees they needed to pay for their daughter to continue her education at the Pacific Adventist University are now within reach and their younger children now have bicycles to get to school.
""I am a happier wife and mother,"" Pastor Tania affirms. ""My workload has significantly decreased, allowing me to fulfil my other responsibilities more effectively.""
As a result of the Australia-Outspan initiative, 35 cocoa fermentary owners across East Sepik have been equipped with solar dryers, not only enhancing the quality of cocoa produced but cutting labour and production costs, reducing tree felling and air pollution and empowering women farmers like Pastor Tania.
Outspan project manager James Suanga and other extension officers have provided valuable training and education to support the rollout of solar dryers, equipping farmers with the skills and knowledge they need to increase productivity and improve their livelihoods.
The solar dryer project embodies Australia’s commitment to work in partnership to improve livelihoods and help foster a resilient and diversified PNG economy."
Law and order awareness for Rabaul students,21/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3698,,Education,Trust,Nill,"The Rabaul District Law & Order Committee has initiated a comprehensive awareness campaign aimed at educating students about law and order.
Led by the East New Britain Senior Provincial Magistrate, Samuel Lavutul, this initiative seeks to inform students about the different types of offences, their respective charges and the legal implications of engaging in criminal activities.
The awareness is now into its third week with its awareness team, which consists of police officers, court and village courts officials and the respective LLG social development officers.
The aim is to equip young people with important information about their rights and responsibilities as students, as well as address the issue of juveniles unknowingly taking part in illegal activities.
The ENB Senior Provincial Magistrate, Samuel Lavutul, when speaking to students of Malaguna Secondary School recently, stressed on the importance of abiding by the law.
“As students, we have to make sure that we cultivate good thoughts, be careful what you think as your actions run your life,” Lavutul said.
He pointed out that a juvenile is between the age of 10 and 17 years 11 months, adding that a lot of issues in communities are mostly caused by juveniles.
Lavutul added that the students or youths are the future of this province and it is crucial that they understand how the legal framework operates.
He further said by educating them on the consequences of their actions, they hope to reduce the instances of crime and promote a safer environment for everyone.
Meantime, acting Rabaul District Administrator, Freddy Lemeki, has commended the District Law & Order Committee for carrying out the awareness and said the approach is good in promoting open dialogue between students and law enforcement officials.
He believes the program will encourage a culture of respect for the law and empower students to make informed decisions.
On Wednesday, March 19th, the team visited Iawakaka Primary School in the Balanataman LLG of Rabaul District. So far, seven schools in the district have been visited and about six more to go before the team completes the awareness."
NCC Advances Policy to Protect Traditional Knowledge,21/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3694,,Culture,Trust,Nill,"The National Cultural Commission (NCC) is taking significant steps toward safeguarding Papua New Guinea’s traditional knowledge and cultural expressions through the Traditional Knowledge and Expression of Culture Bill, also known as the Pasin Ples Protection Bill.
Speaking at the Maopa Levapuka Tovi Cultural Program, NCC Executive Manager David Taim revealed that the new policy and bill are designed to address gaps in existing intellectual property laws, which currently provide only limited protection for traditional knowledge and cultural heritage.
“By developing this policy and bill, we aim to provide adequate legal protection for traditional knowledge and cultural expressions across Papua New Guinea. This will help safeguard them from misappropriation and commercialization,” Taim stated.
Stakeholder Consultations in April, Policy Launch
The NCC is set to launch the policy in May 2025, following consultative stakeholder workshops scheduled for April. Provincial cultural officers and key stakeholders will be invited to validate the policy before it is finalized.
“By the end of this year, PNG will have a law in place to protect traditional knowledge and cultural expressions,” Taim said.
Recognizing the Maopa Levapuka Tovi Festival
Taim also highlighted the importance of cultural festivals in preserving endangered traditions, referencing the newly launched Maopa Levapuka Tovi Cultural Program in Abau District, Central Province. The festival, showcasing the rare Tovi dance, is one of the first cultural events of its kind in the district.
“This festival is rare and was at risk of extinction. By registering it with NCC and supporting its revival, we ensure the preservation of this important cultural practice for future generations,” he explained.
A Boost for Cultural Tourism
Beyond preservation, Taim emphasized the festival’s potential to boost tourism in the Abau District and the Central Province.
“The Tovi dance and this festival are rich cultural products that can be sustained and passed down to younger generations. From a tourism perspective, this can serve as a key attraction for visitors, benefiting the local economy,” he said.
The NCC has officially recognized and registered the event, committing to ongoing support and funding to ensure its continuity in the coming years. With cultural preservation and tourism development at the heart of its mission, the National Cultural Commission is taking proactive measures to protect, sustain, and promote PNG’s diverse cultural heritage."

CPEM recognize lack of teachers,21/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3689,,Education,Anticipation,Lucas Dekena,"The three-day 2025 Pacific Education Ministers Conferences (CPEM) that concluded yesterday, highlighted several pressing education challenges in the Pacific region.
CPEM Host and Minister for Education, Lucas Dekena and co-host University of South Pacific Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pal Ahluwalia highlighted the closed-door discussions throughout the 3-day conference.
""Our biggest concern has been the shortage of teachers; the ministers are really committed to supporting teachers in the region. A lot of discussion has happened, making sure that teachers are recognized for what they do, and that teaching itself becomes, as Minister himself pointed out, a noble profession; that we must improve the overall quality of teaching and that we must empower our students to be able to learn from the best,"" said Professor Ahluwalia.
He elaborated on several approaches that were discussed during CPEM and how each country in the Pacific will deal with the issue of teacher shortage.
""There are several approaches that have been taken which (are) high level. We've asked the Pacific Regional Education Framework or PacREF to prepare more detailed papers so that we can consider this,” he said. ""There are all kinds of different approaches that are being thought of. One is to increase the retirement age, accelerating teacher training for those who already have a degree to take post-graduate in teaching so they can start teaching if they are not doing anything, and encourage more students to take up the teacher profession.”
Apart from shortage of teachers’, other concerns raised include indigenous knowledge, culture and languages, Artificial Intelligence and the deployment in ICT, inclusive education, early childhood learning, and pathways to flexible learning.
The next CPEM will be held in the Marshall Islands in 2027. Recommendations from CPEM 2025 will be assessed and progress tracked in the two years leading up to the 2027 meet."

LLG Administration amended Bill passed,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3680,,Politics,Trust,"James Marape, Soroi Eoe","Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed parliament’s passage of the Local-Level Government Administration (Amendment) Bill 2024, describing it as a critical step towards strengthening governance, accountability, and service delivery at the community level.
The Bill, introduced by the Minister for Provincial and Local-Level Government Affairs, Soroi Eoe, was passed today with strong bipartisan support, reflecting the government’s commitment to empowering local governments, improving leadership standards, and ensuring better management of community resources.
Marape hailed the amendments as a game-changer for local governance, saying they will improve leadership accountability, prevent financial mismanagement, and ensure greater oversight over local-level administration.
“This is a significant victory for the people of Papua New Guinea. For too long, weak governance structures and mismanagement at the local level have hindered service delivery and development in our communities,” Marape stated.
“These amendments will ensure that local leaders are more accountable to the people they serve, ward members have clearly defined responsibilities, and misuse of public funds is prevented through stricter financial regulations,” he added.
Key Reforms in the Bill
The Local-Level Government Administration (Amendment) Bill 2024 introduces several key reforms, including:
Stronger Accountability for Ward Members:
-	Section 11 has been amended to include additional roles and responsibilities for Ward Members (Councilors), ensuring greater accountability and transparency in community leadership.
Higher Leadership Standards:
-	Section 14 strengthens the qualifications of Local-Level Government (LLG) members, ensuring that only competent and capable leaders are elected to serve the people.
Stricter Financial Oversight:
-	Section 45 removes and bans Chairmen and Board Members of Local-Level Government Special Purpose Authorities (LLG SPAs) from acting as signatories to bank accounts, preventing potential abuse of funds.
-	Section 50 grants the responsible Minister specific powers to take punitive action against LLG SPA Chairmen, Boards, and Management if they are found to be misusing public funds or abusing their authority.
The prime minister further emphasized that these reforms align with the government’s broader vision of decentralizing power, strengthening sub-national governments, and ensuring effective service delivery to the grassroots level.
“The National Government is committed to ensuring that local governments function effectively and are responsive to the needs of the people.
“This Bill gives us the tools to address governance breakdowns, improve service delivery, and restore public trust in local leaders. The people deserve transparent, accountable, and effective leadership, and this legislation moves us closer to that goal.”
Marape urged local leaders, ward councilors, and provincial governments to embrace the reforms and work together to implement them effectively.
“This law is only as strong as our collective commitment to upholding it. I call on all levels of government and community leaders to take this legislation seriously and ensure that it is enforced effectively for the benefit of our people,” he said.
He also reaffirmed his government’s commitment to further strengthening governance structures and ensuring that Papua New Guinea continues to progress towards stronger, more accountable leadership at all levels.
“The passage of this bill is a win for the people. It is a win for good governance. It is a win for the future of Papua New Guinea,” Marape said."
Lae police confirm cell breakout,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3681,,Crime,Fear,Nill,"20 remandees at the Lae Top Town Police Station escaped the police holding cell in between 12am and 2am this morning.
Lae Metropolitan Superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, said they believe a small hacksaw that was smuggled in was used to cut the wrought iron bars and wire grill on a window.
The remandees squirmed through the small, rectangular-shaped opening and dashed for freedom.
“About 20 had escaped but one was recaptured at the new temporary market downtown, today,” said Kunyanban.
“The cell is housing most of the summary (offences) cases; not notorious criminals. So, we had to verify the names and type of offences the suspects were charged with.
“As soon as that is out, we will definitely inform the public and confirm the figure of those who escaped. That will be verified later. As I am speaking to you, the team is going to double-check on the information so that it is circulated for public consumption as well as to forward to our hierarchy.”
The hacksaw that was believed to be used could potentially be attached to a makeshift handle, like a toothbrush or a small stick, and used to cut through the wrought iron.
It would have taken painstaking hours to cut through the bars.
“When you look at the opening of this cell where they had cut open, you can see that it was done over a period of time without anyone noticing until everything was ready to go and they went.
“The hacksaw that was smuggled in, how it went in, all that will fall back on the investigation. As soon as the investigation is completed, we will confirm how it actually happened and how the hacksaw was smuggled into the cell.”
Kunyanban said the discovery was made during the 2am cell inspection, outlining that the breakout was during a time when the police personnel rotate shifts.
Cells are not inspected hourly but at two-hour intervals, with Kunyanban saying the remandees knew the timing of the change in shift."

Igitoi confirms K15 million loss to January riots,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3676,,Government,Anger,Richard Masere,"The revelation by the Minister for Administrative Services, Richard Masere in parliament on Tuesday, 18th March 2025, that the National Statistics Office had lost K15 million worth of census materials last year during the January 10 riots, attracted overwhelming criticism from the public. Many questioned its validity, claiming that no official statement was released following the incident.
National Statistician, John Igitoi called a media conference yesterday and confirmed the loss.
He put the estimated value of the loss to K15.2 million. The cost included the actual cost of the procured census materials earmarked for the 2021 Census to be around K14,127.34 and the balance from other unused materials from the 2021 Pilot Census test operations and other surveys.
“We got about 15 plus million-kina worth of census materials burnt on the 10th of January last year (2024) on Black Wednesday and it brought us back to some months of preparation. To prepare for such major events, you need to do preparations a year in advance,” Igitoi stated.
NSO did a brief to the minister on the 05th of March, detailing the costings of the census materials that were burnt during the riots.
The report to the minister stemmed from a separate preliminary report compiled by NSO’s Procurement and Logistics team. In that report, it was stated that NSO has a binding Storage Services Agreement and a Logistics Service Agreement with Post PNG Limited, stating Post PNG has been a major partner in providing storage and logistics services since it was contracted to NSO in 2029.
The warehouse, located in the same yard as Deshbesh Konedobu, was leased to Post PNG by Budget Real Estate. NSO, a client to Post PNG, stored its items in that warehouse following the demolition of Post PNG’s former warehouse at the wharf.  During the January 10 riots looters broke into Deshbesh and NSO containers. They looted all items before setting the place on fire. The census materials were procured through a NPC tender in 2021. Apart from these materials, NSO also lost census-related documents and files.
Post PNG Ltd wrote a letter to NSO on the 29th of January 2024, expressing sincerity and regret over the incident, assuring NSO that they have reported the matter to police and that police were working to hold those involved responsible. However, to date, no formal announcements of the incident were made, nor of any arrests relating to the incident.
Igitoi also confirmed that NSO does not procure insurance as it is not part of its procurement process.
“So we were not able to insure those things, as a matter of fact,” he added. “But the major procurers, when they provide invoice to us, they consider the insurance part of it because they got to import from abroad and it’s a requirement that insurance is covered.”
“For us, it was distributed by our SOE (Post PNG Ltd) and we expected them to have an insurance arrangement in place,"" Igitoi said."
Neville Devete testifies against Yafai,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3672,,Politics,Anger,James Marape,"Former Solicitor General, Neville Devete in his testimony against Yafai yesterday revealed that Yafai had defied instructions issued to him and other senior finance officials not to make any payments to Paul Paraka as there was a Supreme Court order in place.
The Supreme Court had issued a stay order in 2006, stopping further payments to Paraka Lawyers and the National Executive Council also issued a memo also instructing Finance Department not to make any more payments to Paraka Lawyers.
Devete who testified via a video link from Australia said he joined the Department of Justice and Attorney General as the Solicitor General in 2007.
Devete said when officially sworn in as Solicitor General, there were a lot of controversial issues regarding brief out-of-payments to private law firms engaged by the state.
He said in March 2012, a whistleblower from the Department of Finance informed him about a K30 million that was missing from the lawyer's funding account.
Having this information on hand, he wrote a letter to the police on March 14th, 2012 , outlining that payments had been made without following the right processes. Another letter was sent to the Secretary of Finance about the missing funds.
In his letter he outlined the process of payment to private law firms, stating that the payments to law firms are done by the Department of Justice and Attorney General, through the Solicitor General’s office and once approved, the Department of Finance makes the payments.
He stated that these processes were not followed because the K30 million was paid without following that process.
Devete said when investigating the matter, it was uncovered that five different payments were made to different law firms on February 17th, 2012. All payments were done on the same day and Paraka Lawyers was one of the recipients of this payment.
Following Devete’s testimony, lawyer representing Yafai, Edward Sasingian said copies of the NEC memo and the Supreme Court Order were not attached to the letter to Finance, which Devete confirmed that he never attached copies of the memo and court order.
Yafai’s lawyer also outlined that Devete’s complaint was based on the K30 million and not the K41 million payment in which Yafai is allegedly been charged and trialed for.
Devete confirmed that he filed a complaint with the police when he was made aware of the K30 million payment and further requested the police to investigate the K41 million too.
Meanwhile, Devete completed his testimony yesterday. The court adjourned the matter to March 24th for Prime Minister James Marape to testify."

A steep, rugged bush track was their only connection to the outside world, making even the most basic necessities difficult to access. But today, thanks to a rehabilitated road supported by the International Labour Organization (ILO) under the EU-STREIT PNG Programme, life in Wautogik is changing in ways once thought was impossible.
A Life of Struggle Before the Road
Julius Yahapin, a 79-year-old retired teacher, remembers a time when every trip to town was a test of endurance.
“To buy basic things, we walked down a steep track to the main highway. Mothers struggled, carrying heavy loads—especially in the rain,” he recalls.
Farmers like Julius cultivated coffee, cocoa, and coconuts, but selling them was a challenge. Women carried their produce down the track, often waiting days for buyers to arrive. “Sometimes they never came,” Julius says.
Urgent medical situations were even more dire. “We carried the sick on stretchers down the same path,” adds Tony Nindim, a village leader.
For Nancy Watia, a mother of three, selling vegetables in town meant long, exhausting journeys. “I could only carry what I could balance on my back. I made about PGK 100 per trip, but PGK 20 went to bus fare,” she says.
A New Path to Progress
In 2024, the EU-STREIT PNG Programme rehabilitated the 7.8km Banak-Wautogik road, serving over 2,000 villagers. The upgradesincluded gravel surfacing, 22 pipe culverts, two slab culverts, a reinforced concrete causeway, and a bridge, transforming access to the village.
“Now PMVs drive straight to our homes,” says Julius. Buyers arrive bi-weekly to purchase cocoa, saving farmers the grueling journey. “Before, carrying goods limited how much we could sell. Now we sell more,” Tony says, estimating a 20-30% increase in farmers’ incomes.
For Nancy, the difference is significant. She now earns PGK 150 per market trip—50% more than before the road was built.
ILO-STREIT Chief Technical Advisor Eav Kong confirms the impact: “Transportation costs for cocoa and vanilla have decreased by approximately 10%. Villagers can now reach healthcare and trade centers more easily.”
Health, Hope, and New Businesses
The road has become a lifeline. “Mothers in labor reach health centers quicker. The sick get help in time,” Tony says. A daily PMV service connects villagers to Wewak town for trade, shopping, and medical care.
New businesses are also emerging. A village store has opened, reducing the need for long trips to town. “With more income from crops, this store will grow,” Tony says. Villagers are even exploring fish farming—an idea that was once impossible due to poor access.
A Mother’s New Opportunity
For Nancy, the changes extend beyond the marketplace. She joined the Road Maintenance Group (RMG), an initiative by ILO to ensure the road remains accessible. Since September 2024, she has earned over PGK 4,000, providing her with steady income for the first time in her life.
“Before RMG, I never made this kind of money. I bought solar lights for my home. Now I can sew at night,” she says, beaming. Her next goal? Building a proper house for her family.
A Village Transformed
Hope now thrives in Wautogik. Julius reflects on the transformation: “I’ve seen this village without a road. Now, with it, our future is bright.”
For the people of Wautogik, the road is more than just a path through the hills—it’s a path to opportunity, health, and dreams that no longer feel out of reach. “We are no longer limited by what we can carry,” Nancy says. “We can build something now.”"
CPL's Water Project Transforms Lives,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3670,,Health,Trust,Nill,"For many communities in Papua New Guinea, clean drinking water is a daily struggle. The City Pharmacy Limited Foundation Inc.'s new Water Harvest Project is more than just a corporate initiative—it’s a beacon of hope for families facing water scarcity.
At yesterday's launch of CPL Group’s Distribution Centre, CPL Foundation Chairman, Sir Mahesh Patel shared his vision of sustainability and public health. The initiative will collect and filter atmospheric water, reducing reliance on municipal supplies while promoting water conservation.
For many, this could mean fewer illnesses, safer drinking water, and a healthier future for children.
Waterborne diseases are a major threat in PNG, especially for young children. With this initiative, CPL Foundation is not only optimizing its supply chain but also proving that businesses can be drivers of positive change.
During the live demonstration, stakeholders watched as the system transformed air into clean water. For those present, it wasn’t just technology on display—it was a glimpse into a future where clean water is no longer a luxury.
""At the CPL Foundation, our mission has always been to empower communities, improve livelihoods, and create sustainable solutions to some of the most pressing challenges our people face. One such challenge—perhaps the most fundamental—is access to clean drinking water. This initiative has the potential to change lives across rural Papua New Guinea,"" Sir Mahesh stated."
Marape welcomes passage of Fire and Rescue Service Bill 2025,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3671,,Government,Trust,"Billy Joseph, James Marape","Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed the passage of the Fire and Rescue Service Bill 2025, describing it as a major milestone in strengthening Papua New Guinea’s fire and emergency response capabilities.
The Bill, introduced by Defence Minister Dr Billy Joseph, was successfully passed in Parliament on Wednesday, repealing the outdated Fire Service Act (Chapter 64) and replacing it with a modern legislative framework to address the country’s growing urban landscape and evolving emergency response needs.
The Prime Minister commended Minister Joseph for championing this crucial legislation.
“For decades, our fire service has operated under an outdated legal framework that has hindered its ability to expand, modernise, and meet the increasing demands of our communities. The passage of the Fire and Rescue Service Bill 2025 ensures that we now have a stronger, more responsive fire service capable of handling emergencies more effectively,” said Marape.
The new law introduces regulatory functions for fire safety, expands firefighter responsibilities to include rescue operations and emergency response, and strengthens coordination between the National Fire Service and other government agencies.
It also establishes a clear funding structure in line with the Public Finance (Management) Act 1995, ensuring greater accountability and resource allocation for fire services nationwide.
Marape highlighted the government’s ongoing commitment to investing in firefighting infrastructure, equipment, and training to improve emergency response times and preparedness.
“Our government is committed to building a resilient and well-equipped fire service that can effectively protect our people and businesses from disasters. This legislation provides the foundation for greater investment in fire stations, manpower, and technology, ensuring that every province—including the Autonomous Region of Bougainville—has access to professional fire and rescue services,” he said.
The Prime Minister also urged all stakeholders, including local authorities, businesses, and the general public, to support the government’s efforts in strengthening fire safety awareness and emergency preparedness.
“I encourage all Papua New Guineans to work together with our fire service to ensure a safer and more disaster-resilient country,” he stated.
The passage of the Fire and Rescue Service Bill 2025 marks a new era for Papua New Guinea’s fire services, reinforcing the government’s commitment to modernising essential institutions and ensuring public safety."
PM reaffirms commitment to building new hospitals,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3673,,Health,Trust,"James Marape, Keith Iduhu","Prime Minister James Marape has reaffirmed his government’s commitment to establishing eight provincial hospitals in Papua New Guinea.
The Prime Minister was responding to questions from the Member for Hiri Koiari, Keith Iduhu during Parliament session today. Iduhu queried the status of the proposed Central Provincial Hospital since it’s launching in 2021.
The Prime Minister clarified that funds were already allocated to the Central Provincial Health Authority for the establishment of the hospital.
He further highlighted that the establishment of these hospitals is part of a broader strategy to enhance healthcare delivery, reduce mortality rates, and provide comprehensive medical services to local populations.
“By investing in provincial hospitals, the government aims to ensure that citizens can receive quality healthcare closer to home, which is especially crucial in a country where geographic and logistical challenges often hinder access to medical facilities.”
The Prime Minister also emphasized the importance of collaboration with provincial governments and local communities in the planning and implementation of these healthcare facilities.
“The focus may include not only building hospitals but also training medical personnel, improving health education, and addressing public health challenges.
“Overall, this initiative is a key component of the government’s efforts to strengthen the health sector, promote equity in healthcare access, and ultimately enhance the quality of life for all Papua New Guineans.”"
Educate young men,19/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3665,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"As Parliament continues to debate on gender-based violence and gender equality. Many MPs highlight the challenges of the issue, calling for a real solution.
Member for Talasea, Freddie Kumai called for the education of boys and young men; He urged leaders to introduce policies and programs that will shape our boys and men into responsible, loving, and disciplined individuals in the country.
Kumai urged the leaders to educate young people from an early age on respect, dignity, and the sacred role of women in society.
“Let us establish mentorship programs, strengthen fatherhood initiatives, and ensure that boys grow up knowing what it means to be real men.”
“As we confront one of the most tragic realities plaguing our beloved Papua New Guinea-the rising tide of violence against our women and girls. “This is not just a crisis; it is a moral failure, a stain upon our nation that threatens the very fabric of our families, our communities, and our future.”
Kumai said Papua New Guinea can rise to a standard of equal opportunities but it starts with every one of us.
“It starts with holding our men accountable. It starts with teaching our boys the value of respect and responsibility.
“It starts with us saying: Enough is enough! We must no longer be a nation that buries its daughters before their time. We must no longer be a society where women live in fear. We must be a nation where our daughters walk freely, our sisters speak boldly, and our mothers rest knowing they are safe.”
Kumai strongly calls upon every leader in Parliament, every father, every brother, every man to be the generation that ends this cycle of violence.
“Let us build a Papua New Guinea where our women are honored, our men are responsible, and our children grow up in homes filled with love, not fear.”"

Enforce laws on GBV,19/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3663,,Politics,Anger,"Benjamin Mul, Gary Juffa, Lino Tom","As Parliament address Gender-based Violence and Gender Equality and Women Empowerment, Member for Wabag Dr Lino Tom has called on law enforcers to enforce the law in the country if the Government is serious about addressing gender equality and gender-based violence in Papua New Guinea.
Dr. Lino in Parliament today emphasized the urgent need for law enforcement agencies in Papua New Guinea to take decisive action to combat gender-based violence and promote gender equality.
“We cannot come into this house and present some floury statements making us look good if we are not practicing what we preached.
“Many perpetrators who commit severe crimes about gender-based violence are still roaming g freely without being arrested. “What are we doing in this house? Dr Lino asked.
His call to action reflects a growing recognition of the prevalence of such issues in the country and the role that effective law enforcement plays in addressing them.
By urging the government to prioritize these matters, Dr. Tom highlights the importance of a coordinated effort among law enforcement, policymakers, and communities to create a safer environment for women and marginalized groups.
Provincial Member for Northern Gary Juffa supported the call from Dr Lino and call for greater assistance to police officers to enforce the law in the country.
Juffa stated, “We have to enforce tougher laws. Let’s enact serious laws and address the issue, and also have a dedicated police force.”
In addressing gender equality and GBV a focus on human development was emphasised by Member for North Waghi, Benjamin Mul.
His call highlights the understanding that tackling these complex challenges requires more than just legal frameworks and enforcement; it necessitates a holistic approach that nurtures social and cultural changes within communities.
“Every crime created in regards to gender-based violence was done by a human being. If we develop a holistic human being in all its social aspects, he/she will reason out things and will at all times avoid creating crime.
“We must have ‘haus man in our society and educate our young generation on the values of human beings.”
Mul advocated for educational initiatives that raise awareness about gender equality, foster respectful relationships, and challenge harmful stereotypes that contribute to violence against women and marginalized groups.
He also stressed the importance of community engagement and empowerment, encouraging both men and women to participate in discussions and actions that promote equality and justice.
Additionally, the development of support systems for victims of gender-based violence, including access to counseling, legal aid, and safe spaces, could be vital components of this social approach.
By addressing the social dimensions of gender issues, Mul aims to create an environment where equality thrives, ultimately leading to a reduction in violence and improved societal well-being."
10 rescued after 15 hours at sea,19/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3662,,Local,Trust,"Kessy Sawang, Ramsey Pariwa","Nine adults and a baby were rescued off the coast of Bilbil Island in Madang Province after spending 15 hours adrift at sea.
The boat they were travelling on capsized near Basamuk at Tabalig Point with the passengers which included a one-year-old baby together with more than K8,000 worth of store goods after leaving Madang on Saturday at 3pm.
The store goods belonged to one Lillian Anir from Saidor who had hired the boat to transport her cargo. However, all goods perished during the devastating encounter. The boat is believed to have been overloaded at the time of the incident.
Boat owner, Kali Jerry, who is also a survivor knew the boat was overloaded and that they were behind traveling time but decided to continue the journey.
In recounting the ordeal, Mrs Anir said as soon as the boat capsized, she got her phone and called her brother, alerting him of their situation before the phone died.
According to the survivors, they drifted with the tide unsure whether they would be rescued or not.
However, behind the scenes, Mrs. Anir’s brother promptly flagged one of his niece who lived in town, asking her to source help. Fortunately, she was a member of the Madang Rapid Response Network (MRRN) watsapp group that’s dedicated to emergency situations in Madang Province. She posted the plea for help in the group.
This set the ball rolling as group founder John Ariku, and his administrators sent distress signals to the police, disaster and hospital for assistance. A similar call was made to business houses and individuals calling for assistance with a Search and Rescue operation. They were able to secure two outboard motors from Klaus Sarang and a fuel drum with assistance from Paul Rooke of Rooke’s Marine Repairs and Gary Litz of Madang Butchery. Another two boats were sourced upon consultation with member for Raicoast, Kessy Sawang.
According to MRRN, the first boat was launched in for search at 8pm and the second boat left around 8:30pm from Basamuk on Saturday. The other two boats in Madang town also headed out for the search, however, returned due to bad weather.
Search was once again launched early hours of the morning on Sunday, eventually locating them off the Bilbil islands around 6am and rescued.
They were taken in for medical examinations and according to Clinical HEO Israel Lebani at the Modilon Hospital’s accidents and emergency section, all nine adults were stable. Only the one-year-old baby who swallowed a fair amount of salt water had to be monitored but was stable too.
The survivors were thankful to the boat owner for ensuring they were all safe as most of the young men were from inland areas and were unable to swim. Mr. Jerry (boat owner) was swift in his actions resulting in everyone being safe. He managed to put two empty fuel drums under the capsized boat so that some passengers could rest atop whilst he carried the one-year-old baby on his shoulders.
They have now called on their member, Kessy Sawang and Governor Ramsey Pariwa to look into their dilemma faced everyday as this is not the first-time lives and goods worth thousands have been lost.
The survivors are currently residing at the Binan residence of Klaus Sarang and MRRN have taken the responsibility in ensuring their wellbeing. They have been taken in for counselling at the Modilon Hospital with the one-year-old and mother admitted for further treatment and observation.
MRRN is making a public appeal for donations to assist the survivors who have lost everything. Food items, water, clothing, hygiene items, baby supplies, fuel donations and even financial assistance is being sought to assist these traumatized victims return home.
Discussions are going on with Member Sawang, the disaster office and other stakeholders to better assist these survivors."

"Saii Kay Defends Music, Integrity",19/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3656,,Arts,Anger,Nill,"Renowned PNG artist Saii Kay has responded to social media criticism regarding his recent performance in the Solomon Islands, dismissing allegations of misusing taxpayer funds. He described them as ""baseless and malicious.""
The backlash stemmed from claims that the trip, organized by Aelan Riddim for a music festival, was funded by public money.
“It is truly disheartening to see such comments when the reality is that artists like us rarely receive support from our government,” he stated.
“We have built our careers from the ground up, often with our own resources, and we continue to support each other. The notion that we are misusing public funds is not only false but undermines the hard work we put into our craft.”
Beyond the performances, the tour also included engagement with local students, encouraging them to prioritize education. “We wanted to inspire the youth to study hard and strive for their dreams,” he explained. “Music has the power to motivate and uplift, and that was our goal during this festival.”
Addressing criticism of his personal style and appearance, Saii Kay acknowledged the feedback but emphasized authenticity. “I accept the criticism regarding my appearance, but I must be true to myself. I come from humble beginnings, and I refuse to pretend to be someone I’m not. My upbringing shapes who I am, and I believe it’s important to embrace authenticity.”
He also called for greater recognition and support for the creative industry in Papua New Guinea. “It’s time for our government to recognize the contribution of artists to the culture and economy. We deserve support, not scorn. I am proud of who I am and where I come from, and I will continue to represent that in everything I do.”
Highlighting the potential of the arts to address youth unemployment, he added, “The creative industry has a lot of potential to close the unemployment gap in PNG. Not everyone is going to be a doctor or a lawyer, but there are other means and ways of survival in this country, and the arts industry is one of them. If I can inspire 10 people, then to me, that’s 10 less criminals on the street or 10 less internet trolls.”
Saii Kay remains committed to his craft and stands firm against detractors while advocating for the growth of PNG’s creative sector"

Pindiu driver apprehended,18/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3652,,Local,Sadness,Nill,"Police in Finschhafen, Morobe Province, have apprehended the driver responsible for an accident that caused the death of three people.
Gagidu Rural Police Station Commander, Inspector Dominic Livar, said the 35-year-old Kote man was taken into police custody on the morning of Monday, March 17th.
Police say the suspect, from Siki village, was heading to a ‘haus krai’ in Onsesu village, in the Hube Local Level Government, on Wednesday, March 5th, when he lost control of the vehicle at Garenggareng, in Pindiu.
Initial reports said there were 17 passengers at the back of the open-back dark blue Landcruiser that was on hire. A female nursing officer at the Braun Memorial District Hospital, a 13-year-old Grade 4 student and his mother reportedly died on impact when the vehicle ran off the cliff. The other passengers had received serious injuries and were taken to the Braun hospital, while some were brought to Lae.
“There were two lots of passengers for this hire. The first lot was driven by the vehicle owner’s son,” said Inspector Livar.
“The second group of passengers had arrived in Finschhafen earlier than expected, so an alternate driver had to be called in.”
Livar highlighted that an open-back Landcruiser should not take more than 10 passengers. Despite his calls for adherence to safety, PMV operators and vehicle owners continue to flout traffic rules.
“This is total ignorance,” he stated.
“As Police Station Commander Finschhafen, I am very vocal about the overloading of PMVs. However, my pleas seem to fall on deaf ears.”
The driver is facing three counts of dangerous driving causing death."
Farmset empowers Madang farmers,18/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3651,,Agriculture,Trust,Nill,"Farmers in Madang were privileged to attend a piggery and poultry training, facilitated by Farmset Ltd at the Country Womens Association (CWA) conference room yesterday. The 30 participants were loyal Farmset customers selected at a fee of K20. 00 to enhance their knowledge of farming.
Farmset brought in their expert nutritionists, chicken veterinarian and in addition, Piggery and Poultry farmers from Australia who use their products on their farms. The sessions conducted gave vital information of the products available to customers and an in-depth knowledge on quantity and dosage of certain products.
“Farmset Farmers Training is purposely to assist farmers in livestock care and breeding. We have a lot of farmers so we are trying to assist them in whatever expert knowledge we can as we are one of the top farming shops in the country,” said Ernest Tagai, Farmset’s senior sales person in Madang.
Farmset is a locally owned company and sells equipment, feed and chemicals for piggery and poultry in the nine branches they have nationwide including one in the Solomon Island. They also have a factory in Morobe province where feed is produced and tested for local distribution. This enables them to have nutritionists and chemical experts who meticulously ensure that their product is up to standard and provide the best nutrition for livestock.
Local farmer Pius Bokorum, who started his piggery and poultry journey five years ago after retiring from Divine Word University was appreciative of Farmset’s effort to empower local farmers who are venturing into entrepreneurship. He stated that his K20 has given him the opportunity to gain so much more and wished he had known the information disseminated five years ago. He is one of the local egg distributors in Madang with his own brand.
“Food security is something that we all should contribute towards that is why I started investing. I’m grateful for this workshop in terms of knowledge gained today. I’ve learnt the dos and don’ts which will go a long way in assisting me with my livestock program,” Mr. Bokorum stated.
Mr. Bokorum encouraged youths and those unemployed to turn to agriculture and livestock as there are vast opportunities there to ensure food security, employment and stable income. However, he also stressed on the challenges that him and other local farmers have faced and calls upon the Department of Agriculture and Livestock and other relevant government agencies to look into their plight.
“I’m facing challenges with regards to stock feed for layers, our costs are high, especially for us local farmers. Our politicians are talking about big things, but they are not actually coming down to our level to provide needed support. I believe, the government should seriously look into subsidizing stock feeds for us local farmers so we are able to grow our projects,” Bokorum added.
The sessions were very interactive and farmers learnt the basics of piggery and poultry care, including daily feeds per kilo of livestock feed, disease control mechanisms, development stages and weaning of livestock and even artificial insemination which might take a few years to be practical in some parts of the country like Madang.
All participants were additionally gifted with bags of stock feed, piglet milk, shirts and information brochures on the livestock products and starting a livestock project."

Most corporate-sponsored students such as those sponsored by their local MPS and those from resource areas are yet to get computers because of payments delay from their benefactors.
Students welcomed this initiative from the college.
“I’m proud to be part of HYTARC TVET College, and I thank HYTARC for issuing laptop to those of us who had paid 70% upfront fee and I’m privileged that I’ll be part of the online training in this institution. And it’s like the first time for me to be in the online training,” said Adrian Newton from Milne Bay.
“I wanna say thank you to TVET College, especially our director for making this school a second opportunity to some of us, and I’m proud of it,” Leanne Leo, a Business Management student expressed."
NDOH staff demand appointment permanent secretary,18/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3643,,Health,Anger,James Marape,"The staff of the National Department of Health refused to work this morning over the prolonged delay in appointing a permanent secretary for the department.
The staff demanded that a Secretary be appointed to lead the department as Acting Secretary Dr Osborne Liko has been acting in that position for more than four years with no progress in appointing a new Secretary.
The staff will draft a petition and present it to the Minister for Health.
Meantime, Prime Minister James Marape in a statement yesterday said the National Executive Council (NEC) has rejected the Public Service Commission’s (PSC) submission for the appointment of a Health Secretary, citing serious breaches in the integrity of the selection process.
In response, Cabinet sanctioned an administrative inquiry into the Department of Personnel Management (DPM) and the Public Service Commission (PSC) to restore transparency and accountability in public service appointments.
NEC also directed an immediate investigation into the appointment of the Secretary for Health.
Prime Minister James Marape in a statement emphasised that public service positions must be awarded based on merit, not political lobbying or personal connections.
He revealed that some candidates had claimed to be shortlisted and attempted to use that information to lobby ministers for appointments and warned against such practices.
The Inquiry will investigate how confidential shortlist details are being leaked and whether the selection process is being manipulated behind the scenes.
It will also focus on the role of DPM and PSC in the shortlisting and ranking of candidates before Cabinet’s review."

Bugandi notes academic improvement,17/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3629,,Education,Joy,John Rosso,"The once-problematic Bugandi Secondary School in Lae, Morobe Province, has noted significant academic improvement following a change in management in 2022.
Being one of the oldest schools in Lae, it dropped in performance and management, with constant school fights, ailing infrastructure, unpaid bills and no stationery or office equipment.
In 2022, Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, intervened and changed Bugandi’s administration and board.
Bugandi Deputy Principal – Academic, Monica Samol Miapu, acknowledged a shift in students’ mindsets when the Lae City Authority started building them new infrastructure, paid off all outstanding bills and worked hand-in-hand with the Bugandi staff to clean up the mess left by the past administration.
This also reflected in their academic performance, when more students from Bugandi started securing spaces in tertiary institutions.
“That made them to focus on their studies,” she stated. “Results have improved gradually for Bugandi from 2022.
“Other than that, to change the students’ mindsets, the management of the school with the governing council had to make a commitment to actually have students begin wearing formal uniforms. That, one way or the other, added weight to changing Bugandi, with the students’ attitude, discipline – yes, we have disciplinary issues – but it has been managed.
“Students’ performance – both in school and outside – have received positive opinions and views. Indications of students performing well and advancing to tertiary institutions; all sectors of the tertiary institutions, that means technical schools, universities and colleges. Bugandi is among students progressing.”
In 2022, over 60 students went on to continue their education in tertiary institutions. That number rose to 84 in 2023, 83 in 2024 and 79 in 2025.
Miapu further noted an improvement in Grade 11 selection. She said in 2022, over 250 Bugandi students continued to Grade 11.
About 400 Grade 10 students from 2024 have continued to Grade 11 this year, with Miapu stating that they now can fill up the eight new classrooms built by LCA, compared to the previous years when only six classrooms were used."

PNG Gov’t Committed to Bougainville Peace Process,17/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3635,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"The Papua New Guinea Government is commitment to the Bougainville peace process, emphasizing the significance of the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement (BPA) and the necessity for continued dialogue between Papua New Guinea and Bougainville.
Speaking on Monday (17th March) at the opening of the First Joint Consultation Meeting with Bougainville Moderator Sir Jerry Mateparae, Bougainville President Ismael Toroama, United Nations representatives, international stakeholders, and other distinguished leaders, Prime Minister Marape acknowledged the historical journey that has led to the current stage of the peace process.
“This process was born out of the sacrifices of many, and we must ensure that the intentions of the peace agreement remain the foundation for our discussions,” said Prime Minister Marape.
“August 30 this year will mark 24 years since the signing of the agreement, and for 24 years, peace has been maintained without the firing of a single bullet. This in itself is an achievement that we must continue to build upon.”
Honouring the Bougainville Peace Agreement and Constitutional Process.
Prime Minister Marape reiterated that the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement is enshrined in Part XIV of the PNG Constitution, providing a legal framework for dialogue and post-referendum consultations. He recognised the dedication of those who negotiated the agreement, stating that their work continues to shape the ongoing discussions.
“I was not there in 2001 when the agreement was signed, but as Prime Minister, it is my duty to study the records and ensure that we honour the spirit and intention of the peace agreement,” he said.
The Prime Minister acknowledged the results of the 2019 Bougainville Referendum, in which 97.7 percent of voters chose independence, and reaffirmed that Parliament will ultimately deliberate and decide on the matter.
“Let me make this clear – my government allowed the referendum to take place, and we stand by our commitment to the process,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
“However, it is now a constitutional matter that requires Parliament’s deliberation and decision-making.”
Prime Minister Marape highlighted that Section 342 of the PNG Constitution explicitly calls for post-referendum consultations, ensuring that both parties engage in structured dialogue before a final decision is made.
“The wisdom of the 2001 peace agreement is that it does not impose a strict timeline for resolution, but it does outline the importance of consultation and agreement,” he explained.
Economic Independence Must Precede Political Independence
Prime Minister Marape urged Bougainville’s leadership to consider the importance of economic independence alongside political aspirations. He pointed out that 95 percent of Bougainville’s budget is reliant on external support, including funding from the PNG Government and international donors.
“Economic independence must precede political independence. The long-term sustainability of Bougainville must be factored into these discussions,” he added. “Today, as we speak, Bougainville generates only 5 percent of its budget. This is a serious conversation that we must address as part of the broader negotiations.”
He acknowledged Bougainville’s resource potential but stressed that economic structures must be strengthened before full political independence can be realised.
“My duty as Prime Minister is not only to Bougainville but to the whole of Papua New Guinea. We must ensure that any decision we take is in the best interest of all parties,” he emphasised.
Addressing the Risks of Regional Fragmentation
The Prime Minister also highlighted the broader national implications of Bougainville’s push for independence, warning that other regions of PNG may also seek similar autonomy if the issue is not managed carefully.
“Papua New Guinea is the most diverse nation on earth. We have over 800 languages, 20 provinces, one National Capital District and the Autonomous Bougainville Government. If we do not manage this process responsibly, we risk opening the door to similar movements in other parts of the country,” he cautioned.
He stressed that PNG must preserve national unity while respecting Bougainville’s aspirations, urging diplomatic partners and the United Nations to continue supporting a structured, peaceful transition.
Commitment to Continued Dialogue
Prime Minister Marape reassured all stakeholders that the PNG Government remains fully committed to dialogue and consultation, as stipulated in the Bougainville Peace Agreement.
“We have held multiple rounds of consultations, and we will continue these discussions in good faith. There is no rush, as the Constitution does not impose a deadline. Our goal must be to reach a decision that ensures peace, stability, and prosperity for both Bougainville and Papua New Guinea,” he said.
The PNG Government and Bougainville leadership are expected to continue consultations in the coming months, with further discussions on the political and economic future of Bougainville."
Newcastle ends 70-year drought with win over Liverpool in League Cup final,17/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3630,,Sports,Joy,Nill,"Newcastle United has ended a 70-year domestic trophy drought, beating holders Liverpool 2-1 to win the League Cup and spark a Geordie party at Wembley Stadium.
Local hero Dan Burn gave Newcastle a deserved lead in the 45th minute when the defender thumped in a header from a corner.
Roared on by a sea of fans clad in black and white, Newcastle took complete control of the match seven minutes after the break when Swedish forward Alexander Isak swept a shot past Liverpool keeper Caoimhin Kelleher.
Premier League leaders Liverpool finally mustered a response when Federico Chiesa halved the deficit in stoppage time but the damage was done and the day belonged to Eddie Howe's Newcastle, which won the club's first domestic trophy since 1955.
Newcastle was beaten two years ago in the League Cup final by Manchester United but from the start on Sunday it looked likea team determined to stamp its name in the city's folklore as it plugged into the energy from fans.
Liverpool on the other hand looked flat and appeared to be suffering a Champions League hangover after being knocked out of Europe by Paris St Germain on penalties on Tuesday.
After a cagey opening, Newcastle looked the greater threat although it had little to show for its efforts apart from a Sandro Tonali effort that flashed past the post.
Liverpool seemed happy to reach halftime all square and looked like achieving that modest ambition until Burn, called up by England for the first time this week, sent the Newcastle fans into raptures in the 45th minute.
The towering centre back, who returned to his local club in 2022, found himself marked by the diminutive Alexis Mac Allister and it proved a no-contest as he met Kieran Trippier's corner to plant a header inside the far post past the diving Kelleher.
It was Burn's first goal of the season and Newcastle's first at Wembley for 25 long years since Rob Lee scored in a losing FA Cup semifinal against Chelsea.
They did not have to wait long for their next goal and it came from a much more likely source.
Seven minutes after the break, just after Isak had a goal ruled out for offside, Jacob Murphy headed a cross into the path of Isak who quick as a flash swept a shot past Kelleher in front of the massed ranks of black and white.
Liverpool's first shot on target saw substitute Curtis Jones force Nick Pope to beat away his fierce drive but it almost got worse for a stunned Liverpool with Isak denied from close range by Kelleher.
After such a long wait it was never going to be drama-free for Newcastle and Chiesa's neat finish, allowed after initially being ruled offside, ensured a few thousand chewed fingernails before the final whistle ended decades of despair.

“By this action of the Parliament of Papua New Guinea, to amend the Constitution in 2001, PNG was probably the first independent state anywhere to have accorded the UN Charter right and principle of self-determination of peoples to its people under its domestic laws and regulations.
“We recognize that the sessional order is a process that will happen in the national parliament and while we appreciate the engagement in this particular subject, it has diverted our attention from the core agenda of the political settlement on independence.
“The referendum Independence result must be endorsed. In the spirit of the Bougainville Peace Agreement, the two governments can jointly decide as part of the consultations to reach an agreement on a bilateral relationship for independence for Bougainville outside of parliament,” Toroama said.

“Therefore, I expect that the moderation process will have to address the Bougainville independence issue,” Toroama stressed."

Police funds queried,15/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3615,,Politics,Fear,James Nomane,"The Opposition yesterday raised concerns about the safety of citizens as the crime rates in the country continue to soar.
Deputy Opposition Leader, James Nomane the government cannot guarantee the safety of its citizens and asked Police Minister what he is doing with the significant funds he is receiving, amounting to millions of kina.
According to Nomane, in 2023, the government allocated 549milllion kina to the police department. In 2024, it increased its funding to 629million kina,  an increase of 15%. Total allocation in the two years is 1.178 billion kina. In the 2025 budget, police was allocated 703million, totaling up to 1.8billion kina for the police department throughout the 3 years.
“We haven’t seen an improvement in discipline, improvement in professionalism and standards in the RPNGC. We haven’t seen any solutions in police housing, improvement in police capacity equipment and conditions and solutions to the fleet management. We are still hiring. We are not confident we will meet the manpower targets of 7000 by 2026. We have lost trust and confidence, police minister.
“What are the problem that is affecting the Royal PNG Constabulary that is seeing a spike in violent crimes throughout the country and what are u doing about it?”
Police Minister, Peter Tsiamalili Jnr again attributed the declining law and order standards to years of neglect and called for an  increase in reservists at the provincial level.
“The culmination of what is happening today is because over a period of time we have not necessarily as a government addressed our policing. And so at this point in time, our priority is to increase manpower. We created the Bomana Centre of excellence to increase our police numbers, we have now graduated over 500 young police men and women and in the short intervention we’ve also started engaging with provincial governments to increase our reserve numbers. The increase of funds to police was the increase manpower - our personal emoluments must also be the same. K200million is for PIP and K400million went to personal emoluments.”
For the question of police using hired vehicles, Tsiamalili said it was a challenge from the supplier’s end.
“Our challenge with hire of vehicles we use one source of supply which is Ela Motors and they have a huge challenge with vehicles coming into the country. So, while we have purchased we are still waiting for vehicles to be in the country and therefore puts us in a position where we are still hiring.”
Provincial Member for East Sepik, asked a supplementary question related to the impact of the significant funds given to the police department.
“The correlation of the increase of our numbers and the interventions that we are doing as a government will not happen overnight. It takes consistency and efforts to address and get results not overnight. The policy is to increase our numbers,” he said."
Non-functioning of National Lands Board a concern,15/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3614,,Politics,Frustration,"James Marape, Rufina Peter","There has been delays to attending to land matters in the Central Province and the Provincial Member for Central Province, Rufina Peter, raised this concern  during question time in parliament yesterday. She shared that the Central Provincial land board members immediately began work since their swearing in  last year, however  they are yet to be formally inducted, leading to delay in addressing crucial land matters in the province.
“I am aware that the terms of the national board chairman and its members have expired creating a significant administrative vacuum that is negatively affecting land administration processes across the country including the operations of the CP Lands board.
“How soon the chairman of the lands board will be appointed? What measures have been put in place to ensure that the absence of national lands board does not continue to disrupt land administration processes at the provincial level?
“Are there future plans for the government to consider amending the law to allow provincial land boards to function independently in such circumstances?”
Minister for Lands and Physical Planning was not available during the parliament sitting yesterday, however Prime Minister James Marape, assured Provincial Member, Rufina Peter to take action about this.
“I want to give assurance to her that at the very earliest we shall fill the vacancy and get the appointment worked on and the subsequent work as far as provincial land administration. Put in writing.”
Central Provincial land board members were sworn in on the 28th of March 2024, however due to the delay in re-appointment in the Ministerial level, central provincial land board members have not gone through a formal induction. Provincial Member Rufina is hoping this is acted upon quickly so land matters in the province are addressed."

The initiative has helped distribute over one million books to more than 800 schools and communities, giving children the tools they need to improve literacy and learning outcomes.

As Hastings Deering’s outgoing General Manager, Andrew Dare, prepares to return to Australia, Buk bilong Pikinini has acknowledged his key role in supporting this initiative.
Under his leadership, the company has played a critical part in ensuring books reach the hands of children who need them most.
To continue this vital work, BbP and Hastings Deering have signed a new five-year Memorandum of Understanding, securing the future of this literacy program.
This means thousands more children will continue to receive books, opening doors to a brighter future through education.
Buk bilong Pikinini has extended its gratitude to Andrew Dare for his commitment to education in PNG and remains dedicated to providing children with the resources they need to succeed."
Late ToBaining Senior farewelled,15/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3610,,Politics,Sadness,Allan Marat,"A special East New Britain Provincial Assembly was held yesterday (March 14), at the Degenhardt Conference Centre in Vunapope, Kokopo city, to allow provincial leaders to pay tribute to the late Ereman ToBaining Senior, the province's first premier and former regional member.
The casket of the late Ereman ToBaining Senior arrived in the province earlier that day, to a brief reception program at Tokua airport, to allow a formal handover of the casket, from his son and Kokopo MP, Ereman ToBaining Junior, to the ENB Provincial Government.
The late Ereman ToBaining Senior's entry into politics was said to have been rooted in his activism, as he was a firm advocator for indigenous rights and decolonisation, under the Warbete political group in the province during the 1960s.
His political career culminated with his election as the province's first premier in 1977; two years after the country gained independence.
The late Ereman ToBaining Senior served as the Regional Member for East New Britain province for a decade, from 1982 to 1992, under the PANGU Pati banner.
Chairman of the Provincial Assembly and Provincial Member, Michael Marum, in his acknowledgement, said the late ToBaining Senior is one of the rare leaders in the province and thus the province is fortunate to have had such a great leader.
“Under my government, let us also lead our people in a such a manner, with dignity and perseverance, as our predecessors,” Marum stated.
Among the provincial leaders who paid their tributes was Rabaul MP, Dr. Allan Marat, who said the purpose of the life of the late Ereman ToBaining Senior, was for him to be a leader.
“Late Senior ToBaining was blessed with a wealth of information he absorbed through his own observations and initial discussions and interactions with colonial masters and fellow leaders from the province,” said Dr Marat.
“Later he established contacts with other fiery leaders of Kokopo district like late Oscar Tammur, Sir Alkan Tololo, Melchior Tomot, Sir Rabbie Namaliu and others in East New Britain Province, to enter the political arena.
“After his election, he established himself as one of the most distinguished pioneer leaders, committed and always having deep spiritual convictions for service delivery to the people in our province. And he was most respected for that.”
Political heads of Kokopo City and Sinivit LLG also paid their respects, while Kokopo MP Ereman ToBaining Junior acknowledged all those that attended the program, including former leaders who worked with his late father and are still in the community today.
“My father faced a lot of challenges in his political career, but he stood firm and tried to bring unity among warring political groups in the province. Governor, let’s leave something here to capture our province's rich history, not just about the government but also about those in the private sector that helped to shape this province,"" he said.
The speeches were followed by laying of wreaths and public viewing, before the casket of the late Ereman ToBaining Senior was handed over again to his immediate family.
A program was also held at Malapau for a cultural tribute and vigil, while a funeral service will be held at the Bitapabeke United Church today, Saturday, March 15th.
The late ToBaining Senior will finally be laid to rest on Sunday, March 16th, at his home at Malapau in the Kokopo Vunamami Urban LLG.
Late Ereman ToBaining Senior, who hails from Balanataman ward of Raluana LLG, Kokopo District, died at the tender age of 92, just 4 months short of his 93rd birthday."
ENB police challenged,15/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3609,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"The police department in East New Britain has been challenged to use resources at their disposal to improve law and order in the province.
Kokopo City Authority (KCA) Chairman and Kokopo MP, Ereman Tobaining Junior, highlighted this at a recent law and order press conference in Kokopo this week.
Tobaining Jnr said since resuming public office in 2022, KCA has supported the police department with six vehicles and accommodation.
While commending the police department for the festive operation which saw a reduction in lawlessness, the MP also raised concerns with the Assistant Commissioner of Police  for New Guinea Islands, Naua Vanuavaru, about public concerns over the lack of arrest in many reported cases in the district.
“We spent around K2.7 million in assistance towards the police department. The problem is that no arrests has been made on criminals. We can build infrastructure but when there is lawlessness, then it is a waste of resources when facilities like schools get burnt down,” said the MP.
Tobaining was also concerned about the misuse and abuse of donated assets to the police department, and the actions of some suspected rogue officers working with criminals, tipping them off about movements by the police force, saying this is not helping to address the escalating law and order issues in the province.
The district has been riddled with community fights and armed hold ups over the past few years and the MP is concerned on the lack of progress on most of the reported cases.
“We need to put in an operations order and get those suspects arrested. The KCA has financed past operations already and thus, needs the support of the police department to address the continous lawlessness in the communities.”
Tobaining Jnr further called on the provincial and station commanders to “tighten up their belts” and provide leadership for their officers.
Meanwhile, he said KCA will also use the KCA Act to put up measures to assist the provincial government in its strategies to address law and order issues in the province.
Likewise, Tobaining Jnr called on parents and community leaders to take responsibility for the youths and juveniles in their wards.
“Law and order is not the responsibility of the government, but it starts from the family home,” he iterated.
He further said KCA supports the initiatives and decisions by the provincial government, and has allocated funding for programs targeting youths and communities.
The KCA also has committed to assisting the Kerevat Correctional Services with K200,000, awaiting the public accounts to be opened this month."
Aloi takes office,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3606,,Politics,Trust,Ramsey Pariwa,"Following months of infighting over the Madang Provincial Administrator’s role, Daniel Aloi has finally taken office following the dismissal of the stay order that was preventing him from taking office. He arrived in Madang Thursday and was welcomed by government department heads, landowners, the public and Governor Ramsey Pariwa. A welcome ceremony and handing over of the keys to the Administration building was hosted at the Madang Provincial Government Park.
Last year, the national Executive Council terminated the contract of Frank Lau as the Provincial Administrator of Madang Province and appointed Daniel Aloi to replace him. However, Lau obtained a stay order against this NEC decision, preventing Aloi from taking office and he continued to act in this role.
Aloi then filed an application to set aside this stay order. His application was successful early this week with the court setting aside this order, which automatically rendered the NEC decision active, making Aloi the acting provincial administrator of Madang.
Mr. Aloi in thanking NEC was also mindful of the time lost and how it had severely impacted negatively on the provincial indicators for health and education amongst others. . However, he plans to work in partnership with the government of the day through the integrated development plan 2023-2027.
He reminds public servants that time to relax was over as from today and onwards, major changes will occur to steer Madang into the right direction.
Madang Governor, Ramsey Pariwa who was never in good terms with the outgoing administrator Frank Lau, welcomed Aloi and assured the people of Madang that he will work with Aloi to deliver services to Madang.
District Administrator for Madang district Albert Ului, is optimistic that Madang the change in administration signifies a new beginning for Madang province.
Representing the business sector in Madang, Andrew Thorne the manager for Andersons whilst welcoming Mr. Aloi and highlighted what the sector’s needs to the new administrator."
Unemployed face more violence,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3602,,Society,Sadness,Nill,"According to the National GBV Strategy 2016 to 2025 Review Papua New Guinean women who work for SMEs, live on subsistence livelihoods and unemployed women face more violence.
Senior Advisor and Chief Technical Advisor to the United Nations, Vilupti Corlis, emphasized the emerging trend on which type of women in the country who face more violence.
“Women who work for SMEs face more violence or live on subsistence livelihoods face more violence probably due to the economic dependency it could also mean women who are running SME have to travel far with their goods and selling in vulnerable areas, which causes them to have a higher risk. Unemployed women also face more violence which is also due to financial instability,” Corlis said.
Corlis added that those aged 30-39 are most likely to experience GBV, whereas those aged 40-49, although fewer in number, experience the highest severity and frequency violence.
The statistics show higher education increases the likelihood of being wealthier by 98.6% but also increases the likelihood of experiencing GBV by 58%.
She explained, “So, the more educated you are the more you are likely to experience GBV. Those who are married at 25 to 29 are at higher risk of violence and those who are single at 25-29 are at lower risk. From a theoretical point, as we earn more income and educated, we are more likely to stand our ground.”
In comparison to 2020, there have been some important improvements;
– 20 provinces have current GBV strategies and 8 are PEC approved.
–  20 provinces have GBV focal points, and
–  12 provinces include GBV in their budgets, bringing the total of all provincial GBV budgets to K8,845,000 per annum."
PM delivers ministerial statement,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3607,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape in Thursday’s Parliament sitting presented a ministerial statement highlighting five years of the government’s achievements since assuming office in 2019.
Marape said on taking office, he pledged for his government to restore a robust relationship with their departments and agency heads.
“This was necessary in order to make all of us accountable to the advancement of our agenda to improve services and services delivery to our people by aligning plans to resources,” stated Marape.
He underscored that on the 28th of June 2019, a list of priorities that aimed to articulate the government’s broad priorities and indicators taken from the Loloata Resolutions was issued to all ministers as part of the strategic plan to guide efforts towards achievement of the same goals.
These indicators included economic, state enterprise, social, law and order and administrative services sectors.
“Heads of departments and agencies in these respective sectors were requested to develop practical, manageable and achievable implementation plans and to progress them accordingly. My department – Department of Prime Minister and National Executive Council, which was included under the administrative sector was of no exception.
“It has been six years since these interventions were initiated by my government. Today I am pleased to inform this honorable House of the achievement of the ones that directly relate to my role as the head of government and Chairman of National Executive Council.”
Marape highlighted that his plans were to;
•	Restore effectively whole of government coordination
•	Promote best practice for policy implementation
•	Review and update National Executive Council procedures and legislative requirements
•	And digitalize National Executive Council processes.
In order to achieve the above, Marape explained that it was important that a clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities were needed to be established between the Prime Minister’s Department and the Department of Prime Minister and NEC.
The Department of Prime Minister and NEC structurally has three department heads;
1.	Secretary of the Department, who is also the Chief Secretary to Government,
2.	Secretary to the National Executive Council, and
3.	First Legislative Council.
Unlike the Chief Secretary to Government and the First Legislative Council whose positions are established by an Act of Parliament, the position of the NEC Secretary is established by the constitution, Section 150.
Thus, following the prime minister’s ministerial statement, Marape presented a Bill for an act to amend the Prime Minister and National Executive Council Act 2002.
The bill was passed in a vote of majority by eighty (80) Members of Parliament effectively enacting implementation of Section 149, Subsection 5, of the Constitution to provide for the implementation of the decisions of the National Executive Council; and implementation of Section 150 of the Constitution in providing the functions and responsibilities of the Secretary to the National Executive Council.
Prime Minister Marape said, “National Executive Council Bill 2025 strengthens the process of bringing submissions to the council by giving legal effect to the National Executive Council handbook and its implementation.
“In addition to this, the National Executive Council 2025 also addresses the recurrent issues of unauthorized disclosure or access to NEC decisions. Often times this causes stress and anxiety among members of the council the government and the public at large. It could be perceived as a matter of national security when confidential National Executive Council decisions and national interest matters are disclosed to the public or those who are not meant to be seen.”
Prime Minister Marape further stated that the NEC Secretary has the functions of managing and coordinating all affairs of the NEC, assists the Prime Minister in formulating, monitoring and reporting on the ministers’ key result areas, receiving all NEC submissions and ensuring compliance with NEC procedures and assisting in the coordination and implementation of NEC decisions among others.
He clarified that these functions are already being performed by the NEC Secretary and the bill passed in Parliament on Thursday was merely an affirmation that gives recognition to the purpose of the NEC Secretary’s Office.
Prime Minister Marape concluded, “It is the firm view of the Marape-Rosso government that by capturing the NEC procedures together with the functions and powers of the NEC Secretary in an act of parliament, this will eventually lead to whole of govt coordination, bets practice policy implementation and achieving the interventions we made when we took office in 2019.
“Reform and restructure is what we must do.
“We must construct a government structure that is fit for purpose to carry our country.”"
GBV attitudes worsen,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3600,,Society,Disgust,Nill,"The attitude towards Gender-based violence has worsened according to statistics. This was pointed out as an emerging trend at today’s National GBV Strategy 2016 to 2025 Review.
From the review, 5000 plus national surveys, 22 provincial questionnaires, and a 4-region Listening Tour talking to more than 1000 people, tells the country violence is an epidemic and a whole-of-nation pandemic approach is needed to abate the rising tide.
Senior Advisor and Chief Technical Advisor to the United Nations, Vilupti Corlis, during her presentation shared those attitudes towards GBV has slightly worsened and 64% of women in PNG stated they experienced intimate partner violence.
“Even though many respondents understood what gender-based violence is and that couples should not beat each other, some think violence in relationships are still condoned,” Corlis said. “Some say they hit their wife because of burnt food, children neglection and forced sex. 83% of men and 77% of women believe men have the right to beat their wives.”
According to the statistics that were shown, of the nearly 4000 GBV Survivors in the survey, 58% said they told someone, but only 12% said they had reported the crime to the police and only 8% of those resulted in a conviction.
It showed that although 8% resulted in a conviction, the response pathway is ineffective and perpetrators cause further trauma.
Despite these alarming results, 90% of women and 86% of men believe ending gender-based violence is important to PNG."

CEFI bridging the financial gap,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3594,,Business,Joy,Nill,"On Friday, March 7, the Centre for Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI) celebrated International Women’s Day with a special milestone, the graduation of 25 participants from its Financial Literacy (FL) Training of Trainers (ToT) program.
This celebration aligned with the 2025 International Women’s Day theme, “Accelerating Action,” emphasizing the need to equip more individuals, especially women with the financial literacy skills to train others.
The five-day program, conducted from 3 – 7 March, was designed to train individuals not only to improve their own personal financial management skills but also to become financial literacy trainers within their respective communities and organizations.
Among the graduates, 10 were women, reinforcing CEFI’s commitment to bridging the financial literacy gap for women and marginalized groups. The participants represented various organizations, including Commerce and Industry (East Sepik), Niugini Health Link (Western Highlands), Tuhava Town Management Limited (Central Province), Rhodes PNG Limited, Ipili National Limited, Taragai Enterprise Limited, PNG Eco Solutions, and Women’s Microbank Limited, while six participants were self-sponsored.
In his keynote address at the graduation ceremony, CEFI Acting Executive Director, Peter Samuel, highlighted the significance of empowering women as financial literacy trainers.
""Instead of having separate events, we chose to combine this graduation with International Women’s Day because empowering women in financial literacy is a key step in accelerating economic empowerment,"" said Samuel.
""Women play a crucial role in building strong families and communities, yet their contributions are often overlooked. Today, we celebrate their achievements and their potential as change-makers in the space of financial literacy and financial inclusion.""
He challenged the newly trained participants to apply their knowledge by training others in their communities.
""Now that you have completed this training, the real work begins. How will you take what you've learned and implement it? How will you teach others about budgeting, saving, and responsible financial decision-making? This program is about more than just learning, it is about becoming trainers and advocates for financial inclusion.""
Representing the graduates, Sharon Woruba emphasized how fitting it was that the training concluded on International Women’s Day.
""CEFI has done tremendous work in promoting financial inclusion, particularly for women. The theme, ‘Accelerating Action,’ perfectly aligns with CEFI’s mission, providing financial literacy that enables women and girls to take charge of their economic future,"" she said.
Other graduates shared their personal transformation through the training as well.
Rita Kari, from Manda village in Western Highlands Province, admitted that before the training, she lacked awareness of her financial habits.

""This training opened my eyes to the importance of financial planning. I am now more mindful of my spending and ready to teach others how to manage their money wisely,"" he stated.
The program’s core objective is to “’Building a Nationwide Network of Financial Literacy Trainers” by developing a network of skilled trainers who can deliver financial literacy training in their respective organizations and communities.
By focusing on savings, budgeting, and responsible personal financial management skills, the program ensures that participants do not just gain knowledge for personal use, but become advocates for financial inclusion, particularly for women, youth, and rural populations."
Opposition seeks legal redress on Section 145 amendment,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3591,,Politics,Anger,James Nomane,"Members of the Opposition are taking the latest amendments to Section 145 of the Constitution to court next week in the hopes the Supreme Court will invalidate what has taken place.
Deputy Opposition Leader, James Nomane, expressed on behalf of the alternate government, that the move by all those who voted in favour of the amended law, are restricting members of parliament and prohibiting them from exercising their right to move a Vote of No Confidence (VONC) against a Prime Minister.
“We’re also announcing now that we will be taking this matter to court and will be filing next week to oppose these changes as being oppressive and not in the spirit of the constitution,” Nomane said during a media conference following yesterday’s sitting. “(It is) restricting members (of parliament) and prohibiting them from exercising their right under their mandate to move a Vote of No Confidence in the prime minister and in that, holding the executive government accountable and ensuring that we have an opposition in the whole process of parliament and parliamentary debate.”
The Marape-led Government, using its numbers in Wednesday’s parliament sitting, passed an essential amendment to Section 145 of the Constitution that now demands an 18-month grace period after a VONC motion has been moved against the sitting prime minister and government, and proven unsuccessful.
The Leader of Opposition said, “So if there’s another Vote of No Confidence and this prime minister successfully defeats that, then the amendment to section 145 comes in and he will have 18 months protection before another Vote of No Confidence can be moved against him.
“By that time, it won’t be relevant anymore, because it will be 12 months before the issue of writs for the next election,” Nomane said.
Parliament voted 81 to 4, in favour of the bill, which, as a constitutional amendment, requires a two-thirds absolute majority of over 79 members for it to be passed.
The prime minister addressed a media conference that afternoon. He said emphasized the importance of stability in the work of government and public service without the continued interruption of VONC motions.
He said, “This amendment provides stability. It is halfway between completely doing away with the VONC provision and allowing it to remain.
“I am a proponent of keeping VONC according to what our constitutional fathers wanted. It is an important instrument in keeping governments in check.
Meantime, the Opposition has filed a Supreme Court application on the validity of the Private Business Committee’s decision preventing a Vote of No Confidence on 27th November, 2024. The substantive hearing gets underway at 1:30pm today.
“Court will decide whether to recall parliament for Vote of No Confidence or declare that parliament was right in its actions,” Nomane said.
The Opposition anticipates a recall of parliament."

Government borrowings not reckless,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3589,,Politics,Trust,"James Donald, James Marape","Prime Minister James Marape announced that funds borrowed last year was not reckless and used within last year’s money plan, after an unsatisfied Member for North Fly, James Donald, questioned the government about their “empty promises” in his district, to ministerial heads and also about the money his government borrowed externally last year.
Member for North Fly, James Donald recalled that in the previous years, several ministers who committed their assistance to the district, never honored them.
“About four or five ministers I approached to follow up on their commitment and they always respond saying they are running on air and they don’t have money. Several ministers are saying their departments don’t have money. Why are these ministries functioning without money? Is this an indication that this country does not have any money? How comes we borrowed plenty money and this problem is still coming up?”
Prime Minister, James Marape in response shared that all districts are given funds, and encouraged the Member for North Fly to not rely on the government only but work together to attract private sector as well.
“Whilst we have budgeted for programs, sometimes funds are delayed and not remitted. I want to dispel the accession that we are not credible and trustworthy in honoring our commitments to departments, districts and provinces.
“Government funding alone is small in respect to these sectors to be worked upon. We allocate funding to facilitate the office and assist partners to have investment in the economic sector. Key partner is districts were land and people can participate in this sector. Every district has a 10 percent allocation from there service improvement fund for economic sector. Sometimes sectors get delayed funding or lesser funding.”
Marape also defended his government’s borrowings.
“Last year’s borrowing was not reckless it was within our last year’s money plan. Stick to this government to see that by 2027 we come back to a surplus or not. The last time this country had a surplus budget was when I was Minister for Education in 2010. Since then we have been running deficit budgets till now. To turn a big economy to clear water will take reconstruction in the economy. We borrow cheaply to refinance expensive debt. We’re maintaining a fiscal consolidation pathway to come back to responsible balance budget by 2027.”"
Semoso praised,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3586,,Politics,Joy,"Francesca Semoso, William Nakin","PNG’s first provincial woman minister and prominent activist, Matilda Pilacapio, expressed how proud she was when she saw the Member for North Bougainville chairing Parliament today.

With voice breaking, Pilacapio said: “I congratulate her from the bottom of my heart. I say this with emotion. I’m very emotional to see her on TV today.
“All I can say is, she learnt the tricks of her trade when she was in the Bougainville government. She was a speaker back then.
“Certainly, she made history because no other woman held a speaker position in the provincial government system, only her. And then, to make it today at the helm, I had mixed feelings. I was surprised but not at all shocked. I was happy and I was on top of the world. It made my day.”
Pilacapio, who was the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries from 1982-1986 in the Milne Bay Provincial Government, recalled the days when Semoso was a young broadcaster who would invite her into the studio for an interview.
“I can tell you that she was very fluent, very alert, very articulate with whatever issues that were trending at that time,” said the human rights and environmental activist.
“When I saw her today, I was proud of her, very proud. I say this because we come from a matrilineal society, where women are in charge of the land. Milne Bay, Bougainville and New Ireland. I knew she had it up her sleeve.
“It’s five days after International Women’s Day that we had this historical moment come into play. And also, our golden jubilee; 50 years of independence.”
Just like Pilacapio, Semoso is a trendsetter; becoming the first Bougainville woman to be elected into Parliament in October 2023. Semoso won the North Bougainville seat in a by-election following the death of William Nakin."
Polye queries 2024 revenue target,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3582,,Government,Anticipation,"Don Polye, Ian Ling-Stuckey","Member for Kandep, Don Polye, in parliament today, called Treasury into question on whether Treasury or the Internal Revenue Commission has reached its 2024 revenue target of K17.3billion and what was implemented afterwards.
Treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey highlighted that IRC did well, however non-tax components let them down.
Commissioner General of the Internal Revenue Commission, Sam Koim, announced last December that the IRC collected K17.3billion at the end of 2024, a milestone achievement.
In parliament today, Polye queried the Treasurer, “If the target revenue was met by the treasury, were the funds sent to all implementing agents to implement the budget appropriation as per 2024 allocations to various implementers like provincial governments etcetera? Why did all the institutions not receive the implementation funds and rectify any issues with the target revenue?”
Minister Ling-Stuckey was happy to shared that the IRC did well and highlighted on the components.
“I can say that they just about did with some very large revenue assumptions that were placed for 2024, they did pretty well,” he said. “IRC were projected to collect K16,158 million, the 2024 outcome numbers still need to be finalized.”
“IRC collected K16,094million a short fall of K164 million they were tasked to collect.
“Customs had projected their budget revenue collection to be K2,537million they were able to collect K2,482million shortfall of K55million.
“Tax revenues one of the two revenue components in our annual budget at K18,695 we collected K18,576million a shortfall of 119 million,” the minister said.
The Treasurer highlighted that tax components of revenues did very well, however it was the non-tax component that was a let-down. He explained and this is why several departments and provincial governments did not receive implementation funds.
“When you look at it, overall, revenues which we had projected excluding grants was K21,189 million, we collected K19,774 and therefore last year’s budget revenues were down 1400 and K14 million.
“So that was the many reasons why we’re slow to meet some of the commitments for various government and provincial governments.
“But the good news is as we close our accounts for this year, we were able to close those accounts in a way that was in line with our 13-year plan and without exceeding our deficit target,” Ling-Stuckey said.
The minister said Treasury and the Department of Finance have a detailed implementation plan and can report to parliament after the budget management committee meeting.
“From the total outstanding expenditures from 2024 which summed up K3,608million of outstanding from last year, we paid out K1,825million,” said the minister.
He said the break-up is summed up to K704million and leaves a total of K1,783million to pay out from last year. Treasury and finance have a target of paying all outstanding by May this year."
Parliament declares PNG a Christian nation,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3580,,Politics,Trust,"Allan Bird, James Marape, James Nomane, Pila Niningi, Puka Temu, Rufina Peter","Eighty (80) Members of Parliament (MPs) have voted to amend Papua New Guinea’s Constitution, declaring the country a Christian nation in the parliament sitting on Wednesday 12 March, 2025.
In Parliament, commending the successful passage of the declaration, Minister for Justice and Attorney General, Pila Niningi said, “Parliament made it its business to establish Papua New Guinea as a Christian country. Christianity came to this country, and that’s why stability is established. Now that Parliament has spoken, that one of the important religions for this country is Christianity, may God bless Papua New Guinea.”
Prime Minister James Marape commended this historic amendment to the Constitution in a press conference after the sitting said, “This law does not stop people of other faiths or religions from practicing their faith and religion.
“We place God in His rightful place. When we look into Christian ethos and theology it recognizes God as creator of the universe, world and our country. It recognizes God as the creator of the resource we have and the creator of our lives so this law acknowledges God and places God in His rightful place.”
Marape further highlighted that Christian churches have long supported the development of the country.
“I am happy. “This constitutional amendment finally recognises our country as a Christian country. This reflects, in the highest form, the role Christian churches have played in our development as a country,” said Marape.
Only four MPs voted against the constitutional amendment declaration of PNG as a Christian nation. These MPs from the opposition ranks included Deputy Opposition Leader and MP for Karimui, James Nomane, East Sepik Province Governor Allan Bird, Abau MP Puka Temu and Central Province Governor, Rufina Peter.
Allan Bird took to social media airing his views in a Facebook post stating, “Congratulations PNG 81 MPs voted to make PNG the Richest Christian Country on Earth.
Adding in the comment section of that post, “All our problems are now fixed by Parliament. You may celebrate.”
The passing of this amendment now introduces a declaration in the preamble of the Constitution, stating, “(We) acknowledge and declare God, the Father; Jesus Christ, the Son; and Holy Spirit, as our Creator and Sustainer of the entire universe and the source of our powers and authorities, delegated to the people and all persons within the geographical jurisdiction of Papua New Guinea.""
Additionally, Christianity will now be reflected in the Fifth Goal of the Constitution, and the Bible will be recognized as a national symbol."
PPL Faces Multiple Unplanned Power Outages,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3583,,Infrastructure,Fear,Nill,"PNG Power Ltd is responding to multiple unplanned power outages caused by Cyclone Alfred, which has severely impacted electrical infrastructure across several regions.
Acting Chief Executive Officer Ivan Pekaea confirmed that Port Moresby experienced partial power outages due to adverse weather conditions.
Affected areas included Gerehu, Downtown, 7 & 8 Mile, and parts of Boroko. The outages resulted from fallen trees damaging power lines, a faulty transformer, a burnt high-voltage bridging cable, and other related faults. These incidents highlight the vulnerability of the city’s power supply during extreme weather.
In Rabaul and Kokopo, strong winds caused damage to power poles and lines, leading to outages. The Ramu Grid, which supplies electricity to the Highlands, Madang, and Lae, suffered a total outage at 11:23 PM on March 11, 2025.
While Lae and Madang were fully restored on March 11 and 12, respectively, restoration efforts in the Highlands continue, with isolated areas still affected.
Pekaea urged the public to avoid fallen power lines and report faults to PNG Power. He emphasized safety as the top priority, with technical teams equipped with proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) before conducting repairs. Restoration efforts will continue as weather conditions permit.
PNG Power remains committed to ensuring reliable electricity supply and appreciates public patience as crews work to restore power safely."

Major amendments passed in Parliament,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3577,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"The Government in a show of strength passed two major amendments in Parliament on Wednesday 12th March.
The first was an essential amendment to section 145 of the Constitution that now demands an 18-month grace period after a Vote of No Confidence motion has been moved against the sitting Prime Minister and government, and proven unsuccessful.
Parliament voted 81 votes to 4, in favour of the amendment, while the second one, which recognizes PNG as a Christian Country was also passed with the same margin.
The amendment has been a long time coming and is part of extensive work carried out by the PNG Constitutional Law Reform Commission in 2022 throughout the country consulting communities, churches, provincial and local leaders, and the civil society who have all agreed to have the Constitution make these important declarations.
Prime Minister Marape, who has always been vocal about the role of Christian churches in the PNG in tandem with government service pre- and post-independence, said today (Wednesday) was “happy” to finally see the bill passed.
Parliament voted 81 to 4, heavily in favour of the bill, which, as a constitutional amendment, requires a two-thirds absolute majority of over 79 members to go through.
Soon after the passing of the amendment to section 145, Prime Minister Marape addressed a press conference after Parliament rose to commend Members of Parliament for agreeing to the change. The Prime Minister emphasised the importance of stability in the work of government and Public Service without the continued interruption of VONC motions against the sitting prime minister.
“Our MPs voted in big numbers. This shows that a VONC motion can be moved but the grace period applies both ways. “This is a good law according to the advice given to Government by the State machinery, congruent with our Constitution.
“This amendment provides stability. It is halfway between completely doing away with the VONC provision and allowing it to remain,” stated Prime Minister Marape.
“I am a proponent of keeping VONC according to what our constitutional fathers wanted. It is an important instrument in keeping governments in check.
“But at the same time, this amendment will stop those without numbers from making disruptive attempts at changing government. In my case, I have stood up to seven VONC attempts in a very short period of less than one year.
“The MPs who voted for this law know the importance of it. They know that political instability has disturbed them and the Public Service machinery from working effectively.
“So as the Opposition, if you are successful in taking over the government, your 18 months grace period starts; but if you are unsuccessful, the 18 months grace period restarts for the sitting government.”
Prime Minister Marape remarked that his government had the voting ability to completely remove the VONC provision, but has chosen against it and settled for the aforementioned amendment instead.
“We could have chosen to completely remove the VONC provision with the voting ability we have, but as a responsible government, we acknowledge that Section 145 is placed for a purpose – to provide a check and balance,” he said.
He said the Opposition had its right to go to Court to contest the amendment if they choose to do so."
Paraka’s bail application rejected,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3573,,Law,Sadness,Nill,"The Supreme Court yesterday dismissed an application filed by convicted lawyer Paul Paraka seeking his release to pursue medical treatment overseas.
The application filed by Paraka on February 17th sought release from custody and grant of bail on medical and humanitarian grounds to undergo medical treatment overseas.
Paraka was convicted by the national court on five counts of misappropriation and sentenced to 20 years. He appealed to the Supreme Court against both conviction and sentence. His appeal against conviction was dismissed, but his appeal against sentence is still pending.
In the meantime, he was advised by his cardiologist that his coronary illness required urgent medial surgery overseas. He lodged a request to the Correctional Services Commissioner to grant him leave of absence from custody, and he also applied to the chairman of the License Committee and the Minister for Justice to consider him being released from prison on license to attend to the recommended surgery. After two months of waiting for a reply to his request, he filed an application for enforcement of his constitutional rights, seeking orders that he be released from custody, or release on bail, or that the relevant state authorities decide his request.
The relief the applicant seeks is about enforcing his constitutional rights under section 57 of the constitution, which he alleges have been breached, and has sought the court's interpretation. Order 6 of the supreme court rules regulates the practice and procedure for filling an application to enforce constitutional rights under section 57 of the constitution.
A three-man bench consisting of Justice Kinsley David, Era Kariko, and Derek Woods presided over the matter.
The bench dismissed the application for being incompetent as it was not properly filed within the order 6.
As to the first order for relief sought to be released from custody, the court has no power to order the early release of the convicted offender; that power rests with other authorities, such as the Minister for Justice under section 50 of the criminal code.
Bail is considered pursuant to the bail act, which was not cited in the application. To be allowed bail and travel overseas, the applicant must apply for probation to leave the country at the same time as applying for bail. This the applicant did not do. Therefore, the court dismissed his application.
Meanwhile, his co-accused Jacob Yafai’s trial will continue on March 19th, 2025."
Parliament passes bill to establish new authority,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3576,,Business,Trust,Jimmy Maladina,"The National Parliament on Wednesday 12 March 2025, passed the Oil and Gas Amendment Bill 2025, effectively allowing the establishment of the National Petroleum Authority that will now replace the Department of Petroleum and Energy.
Eighty-four (84) Members of Parliament voted in favor of the bill, an absolute majority.
Minister for Petroleum Jimmy Maladina when making his statement in Parliament during the second reading speech stated that the amendment bill is part of the overall national government’s key reforms in the petroleum sector to strengthen the institutional capacity of the regulating agency to better administer and manage the oil and gas industry in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
Minister Maladina highlighted that talk of transforming the Department of Petroleum and Energy into a regulatory statutory authority to be a more effective and efficient regulator of the petroleum industry has been around for over a decade.
“In 2013, National Executive Council Decision No.145 of 2013, the National Executive Council approved and directed the establishment of the petroleum and energy authority. Following that policy directive from the government, a separate energy authority was created in 2021 – the National Energy Authority.
“Consequently, NEC decision 156 of 2020 directed the establishment of the National Petroleum Authority. That in 2020 decision was made together with the proposed production sharing framework which involves the Kumul Petroleum Holding,” underscored Maladina.
He said without having to subject the regulator to various fiscal regime models at this point of time, Maladina is prioritizing the creation of the National Petroleum Authority as an independent, effective, and efficient regulator.
“This will bring industry confidence, while the authority play a key role in implementing policies such as production sharing contracts, downstream processing and domestic market obligation amongst other policies of national interest for our country,” he emphasized.
The proposed structure requires the authority to anticipate a budget of K80 to K120 million.
Maladina added, “Revenue generation from petroleum projects are anticipated to maintain and grow two to three folds. That is where the proposed National Petroleum Authority will enhance its role to facilitate more investment projects and policies to create more benefits for the state of Papua New Guinea and its citizens.”
Maladina stated that as minister he plans for the new authority to champion the state’s agenda by creating more investment to support PNG’s socio-economic development.
Emphasizing, “In order (for the) successful implementation (of) the proposed petroleum authority will require adequate reliable funding to conduct its operations and work program on behalf of the state and the people of Papua New Guinea.
The authority’s proposed funding streams are:
1.	Parliamentary budgetary allocation and support from treasury
2.	PIP allocation from the Department of National Planning and Monitoring
3.	Fees and charges, proceeds from the petroleum industry subject to Non-tax Revenue Administration Act of 2020 and determinations
4.	National petroleum levy at a rate of 0.5 % on the gross value petroleum product exported to be paid by the National Petroleum Authority by petroleum only produced similar to the mining sector.
The new authority will be governed within the framework of the Public Finance Management Act and the Tax Revenue administration act of 2022.
Maladina further assured Parliament that, “The proposed National Petroleum Authority is a key enabler for the better management of the oil and gas industry of Papua New. The establishment of the National Petroleum Authority will be the catalyst for the implementation of the government medium-term development plan four – 2023 to 2027 for the petroleum sector of Papua New Guinea.”
Prime Minister Marape remarking on the bill in Parliament commended the minister on his efforts to ensure the passing of the bill, stating, “We came into office in 2019 with a clear agenda, take back PNG.”
He also assured that although replacing the Department of Petroleum and Energy, the new authority will not duplicate functions or create a new organization, and no need for new staff. The department will only be renamed.
“This set up of the authority is not only timely because we are now 50 years on. As a country known for hydrocarbon extraction. We need to move into this space, structures that carry us that doesn’t go well in as far as resource accountability is concerned must be relooked at,” said Marape."

NEC approves Palm Oil Policy,13/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3574,,Business,Trust,James Marape,"The National Executive Council (NEC) approved the National Palm Oil Policy 2025-2030 during its meeting on Monday, 10 March 2025.
Prime Minister James Marape acknowledged the contributions of smallholder farmers, industry stakeholders, and development partners who played a role in shaping the policy.
The comprehensive policy framework provides a clear regulatory direction for Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) thriving oil palm industry, which contributes K2 billion annually to the national
economy and employs thousands of Papua New Guineans.
Marape said the policy is a critical milestone in the government’s broader agenda to achieve a K200 billion economy by 2030, with K30 billion expected from the agriculture sector.
“For the first time in our nation’s history, the oil palm industry will have a structured national policy that ensures landowners, smallholders, and investors operate under a fair, transparent, and well-regulated framework.
""This is about putting Papua New Guineans at the centre of economic growth and ensuring that the wealth from our land stays with our people,” PM Marape stated.
Key Features of the Policy:
• Empowering Landowners and Smallholders – Creates opportunities for greater equity participation and direct financial benefits from oil palm cultivation.
• Stronger Regulation and Compliance – Establishes a dedicated regulatory authority to oversee industry operations, licensing, and environmental standards.
• Fair Pricing and Market Stability – Introduces transparent pricing mechanisms to protect
smallholder farmers from market fluctuations.
• Investment in Infrastructure and Research – Implements levy collection reforms to fund smallholder support programmes, pest management, and rural infrastructure.
• Sustainable and Inclusive Growth – Encourages responsible land use, conservation, and climate-smart practices for long-term industry sustainability.
Marape emphasised that this policy aligns with his ""Take Back PNG"" vision, ensuring that Papua New Guineans are the primary beneficiaries of the nation’s natural resources.
“This policy places resource owners in a stronger position within the industry, enabling them to participate as shareholders rather than just leaseholders.
“We are setting the foundation for PNG to become a leader in sustainable palm oil production while protecting our land and environment,” the prime minister said."
Five new chambers opened,12/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3562,,Government,Trust,Nill,"About five new chambers of the National and Supreme Court refurbished by local contractors were officially opened today by the Australian High Commissioner John Feakes and PNG Chief Justice, Sir Gibbs Salika.
The project was implemented in partnership with the PNG and Australian government through the Australia High Commission and the National Judiciary Staff Services. It cost about K1.7 million to complete the project.
The project began in December 2024 and was completed in February of this year.
The official program started with a keynote address by Mr Feakes and Justice Salika, followed by the unveiling of the plaque and a tour of the chambers.
According to Justice Salika, the objective of initiating the new chambers is due to the shortage of chambers that can accommodate judges. Currently, there are about 10 chambers, which cannot cater for the 42 judges of the national and supreme court.
“I suggested this project because we recruit additional judges and for the other factor that when judges come here for the supreme court sitting, we don’t have enough chambers to cater for them.
“More than two judges are sharing one chamber while the supreme court is sitting, so having additional chambers will cater for them too,” he said.
Salika thanked the people of Australia for the support that will contribute meaningfully to the development of the law and justice sector of PNG.
Australian High Commissioner Feakes said the partnership between Australia and PNG through this project signifies an unwavering commitment to justice and the rule of law.
He said the collaboration reflects Australians' mutual desire to strengthen judicial systems in Port Moresby and other provinces in Papua New Guinea as well."
Coral bleaching evident in ENB,12/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3567,,Environment,Sadness,Nill,"The devastating effects of coral bleaching have already reached Papua New Guinea.
With global warming, over 90 percent of the earth’s heat is absorbed by the oceans. This stresses the coral reefs, and when under stress, they expel the microscopic marine algae that live in their tissues. They then lose their vibrant colours, leading to coral bleaching.
Local conservation group, the East New Britain Sea Keepers, have confirmed what has been predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
“NOAA sent out an alert, warning us of the severe coral bleaching event unfolding on our reefs,” said marine biologist and the founder of East New Britain Sea Keepers, Emma Oliver.
“Now, we are seeing the devastating impact firsthand at Ialakua Village. Coral bleaching is not just a future threat, it is happening right now.
“The once-vibrant reefs are turning white, struggling to survive under extreme ocean temperatures. Fortunately, most of our coral nursery fragments have managed to survive.
“This crisis also presents an opportunity to identify resilient coral colonies that didn’t bleach and incorporate them into our nursery for future restoration.
“The next few weeks and into April will be crucial as our team works tirelessly to save what remains.
“It’s heartbreaking to see the little kids swimming in waters where corals are being wiped out. What does the future hold for them if our reefs disappear?
“The time to act is now. Every effort counts in the fight to protect and restore our marine ecosystems.”"

Witnesses say payment records missing,12/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3565,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"The trial into the Paraka scandal continued today at the National Court. Five witnesses testified yesterday.
They are former Deputy Secretary of Department of Justice and Attorney General Miriam Kias, National Fraud and Anti- Corruption Chief Sergeant Basi Sopata, National Fraud and Anti-Corruption Chief Sergeant Timoty Gitua, former First Assistant Secretary to the Internal Audit and Compliance Division, Tress Wingi and Department of Attorney General Case Management Manager, Christine Gemos.
It was before the court that a few of the witnesses provided an update as to how the allegations of misappropriating payments were made to private law firms including Paraka Lawyers.
The Department of Justice and Attorney General (DJAG) is the authority responsible for paying outstanding legal claims to private law firms. DJAG would send the payment to the Solicitor General for approval before the Department of Finance makes the payout.
The lead investigator in this matter is Chief Sergeant Gitua and the arresting officer is Chief Sergeant Sopata.
According to Gitua, a search warrant was taken out to access Paraka Lawyers’ account with Bank South Pacific, following a complaint laid with police over the allegations.
Gitua testified that they found that the payments were made to Paul Paraka’s personal account and not the law firm’s.
Wingi, former First Assistant Secretary in the Internal Audit and Compliance Division of the finance department, said the accounts payable section could not locate records of these payments, even though the payable officer stated that payments were made to the law firm.
Other key points the witnesses highlighted are:
•	The distributing of bills that were paid to Paul Paraka Law firm did not follow the right processes of payment as stated above.
•	There was a Supreme Court Order that stay the payment of outstanding bills to Paraka law firm in 2006. This stay order was not attached to the letters issued to DJAG, the Solicitor General, and the Finance Department for making the payment. Hence, the payment was made without the knowledge of the supreme court
•	Audit investigations found that the original documents of the cheque payments were not located at the accounts payable files because it was issued to Mr Yafai.
•	The Case Management System records show that there was no record of outstanding bills owned by the state pertaining to the Paraka law firm.
State witnesses are testifying against Jacob Yafai, former Deputy Secretary for the Department of Finance, who was implicated in the Paraka saga.
Yafai faces one count of abuse of office and four counts of misappropriation for the alleged misuse of over K41 million, allegedly paid by the Finance Department to Paraka Lawyers.
The four courts of misappropriation are;
1.	K14 million, on November 1, 2012
2.	K13.8 million on December 20, 2013
3.	K6 million on March 15, 2023, and
4.	K8 million on May 3, 2013
Of the 23 witnesses, 7 are deceased."

The prime minister instead, attended to parliament duties. He was listed to testify today against Jacob Yafai, former Deputy Secretary for the Department of Finance, who is implicated in the Paraka scandal.
Lawyer representing the state made an application to the court, stating the reasons why the prime minister was not in court, and asked the court to allow Mr Marape to appear on March 24th, 2025.
The Chief Justice said, “That (has) never been my plan to extend this trial to the 24th. My plan was to complete this trial on Friday of this week. I will not extend for the convenience of the state or sit around for the next two weeks. In my court, once a matter is started, it started; I do not do start stop business.
“You had Monday to call him in. Parliament will meet on Tuesday of this week. To bring him now, it's not going to be possible because he is in parliament,” Salika said.
Also on the state witness list is Neville Devete, the complainant in the matter. Devete is in Tennant Creek, Australia, and will give his evidence via Zoom on March 19th, 2025.
According to the state, it will take Devete a week to travel by road to Darwin to utilize the office of the Public Prosecutor to give evidence over the internet.
The state further stated that Sinasina Yonggomugl MP, Karenga Kua, will be called in to testify as well.
Due to the unavailability of witnesses, the state submitted for an adjournment. However, the defendant’s lawyer objected to the submission, stating that his client was charged in 2013 and has a right to a fair trial.
After hearing submissions from both parties, Salika adjourned the trial to March 19th, when Devete will testify. Sir Gibbs said Mr Marape and Mr Kua will testify on March 24th."

The passport office at the Nambawan Super building, in Top Town Lae, within the PNG ICSA Morobe Regional Office, was officially opened on December 23 last year by the Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso.
To date, it has printed and issued 1,386 passports.
“Passport applications are being received from Morobe Province, and other provinces including those from the Highlands,” said Rosso.
“Lae is our country’s second largest city, and is in a central location that is more easily accessible by many provinces, and for this reason, it was selected as the first place outside of Port Moresby to print passports.
Rosso, who is also responsible for the Immigration and Border Security Ministry, said government services must be decentralised to reach as many people as possible.
In 2016, the Chief Migration Officer, Wellington Navasivu, was the Assistant Manager of the Morobe Regional Office.
“I played an important role in establishing the Morobe Regional Office in Lae about nine years ago, and in 2024, as the Chief Migration Officer, to also be able to set up and open the Passport Office there is special,” Navasivu stated.
“The new facility is helping to address any delays that may have been experienced in the past because all applications for standard passports lodged in Lae can be registered and printed there instead of in Port Moresby.”"

Sawang shines light on a grim truth - education and opportunity in PNG,11/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3547,,Education,Trust,Kessy Sawang,"Education is a rare privilege and must be embraced. This was the message from the Labor and Employment Minister, Kessy Sawang to the graduating students of Divine Word University last Friday.
“Yes, less than one percent - let that sink in. You belong to an extraordinary minority. The most recent census, conducted last year, will reveal whether we have made progress, but the reality remains, education is a rare privilege in Papua New Guinea,” said Member for Raicoast and Minister for Labor & Employment Kessy Sawang who was the keynote speaker during the 43rd Divine Word Graduation at the Pope John Paul Hall.
She drove home this message to the graduands about their privilege and responsibility in having tertiary education and qualification, adding that the knowledge gained must be utilized to serve, uplift and transform the nation.
“Let me share with you the weight of the honor that has been bestowed upon you. Many in our beloved Papua New Guinea experience poverty in opportunities to pursue education. Consider these sobering statistics from the 2011 Census:
•	Only 6.6% of the population (aged 5 and above) attained a grade 12 qualification
•	Those with a tertiary qualification (vocational, teacher’s colleges, health, business, technical, apprenticeship) account for merely 3%
•	And here is the most staggering figure, less than 1% of Papua New Guineans hold a university degree,” she added.
Minister Sawang encouraged the 761 graduating students that there is greatness that comes with having the responsibility. That in some instances there will be a few that may be required to do more in their field of work more than others. She advised them to take on whatever challenges their role portrays in each workplace and rise to the occasion as patriotic citizens of the country.
Furthermore, she encouraged them to see the opportunities that lie ahead despite the uncertainties, by showcasing their knowledge, values and spirit of service that can transform their communities and nation.
“I urge you to live with integrity, lead with compassion and embrace the richness of your cultural heritage and Christian faith. The true mark of a leader is not in how high they rise, but in how many others they uplift along the way. Be the generation that fosters unity, drives progress and ensures that no one is left behind. In a world that often prioritizes personal gain over collective well-being, you must be different. The Christian principles instilled in you of integrity, humility, compassion and service must guide you as you step forward. Carry them with pride and let them shape your actions, decisions and leadership,” Sawang stated."

CLRC to preserve iconic Constitutional House,11/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3544,,Government,Anticipation,Nill,"The Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) is currently in discussions with the University of Papua New Guinea regarding a potential restoration and redevelopment of the historic Constitutional House located on Motupore Island.
“These discussions are still in the infant stages, and no final decisions, or agreements have been made at this time,” Secretary Dr. Mange Matui said.
Secretary was responding to a news article that appeared in a daily newspaper recently, concerning the state of the Constitution House. Secretary Matui, acknowledged the concerns raised in the news article, and agreed that something needs be done about the building.
CLRC’s negotiation with UPNG as the caretaker and owner of the site and building will hopefully result in a formal understanding between the two institutions, aimed at preserving the site for educational purposes and to honour its historical significance for future generations.
This collaboration with UPNG is important to ensure CLRC has the necessary space and organize resources to begin restoration work of the building.
As the country excels towards its 50th Independence Anniversary, it is fitting that such high esteem building be recognized and declared as a monument of historical importance while featuring as part of the Independence celebrations.
The CLRC recognizes the historical importance of the Constitutional House, given its inspiring nature as the designated site where the forefathers as members of the Constitutional Planning Committee (CPC) normally met and crafted the Constitution before it was adopted by the Constituent Assembly in September 1972.
The CPC was instrumental in guiding and facilitating the creation of a Constitution that would serve as the legal foundation for an independent Papua New Guinea, as well as designing legal, political and governance structures, and consultations and the decolonization process, tasks CLRC continues to carry out daily as part of its mandate as the only law reform agency of PNG."
French Navy vessel makes a memorable stop on Yule Island,11/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3542,,Local,Trust,Nill,"On Saturday 8th of March, a French navy vessel based in New Caledonia, the Frigate “Vendemiaire”, anchored at Yule Island in Central Province to carry out a memorial action through the cleaning and restoration of the grave of Lieutenant Léon Bourjade, a French flying ace in the First World War who died in 1924 on the island where he later became a missionary.
Famous for his ""acrobatic"" landings, his name is still associated with aviation through the expression ""landing like Bourjade"".
A ceremony was held in the presence of European Union Ambassador Jacques Fradin, French Deputy Head of Mission Khouira Drault, Managing Director of TotalEnergies Arnaud Berthet, Operations Director for TotalEnergies Eric Casse, Captain of the “Vendemiaire” Gauthier Guillaumat and his crew, and dignitaries of the island and their community leaders. The island's residents also turned out to attend the event.
It was not the first time that French officials and militaries paid tribute to the Lieutenant on Yule Island, many military vessels used to stop over there in the past. Last year, this tradition was revived when the French Navy Vessel “Auguste Benebig” came.
This year, it was the 101th year of Lieutenant Bourjade’s death on Yule Island. Captain Guillaumat, the officers and sailors of the ""Vendemiaire"" were very touched by the warm welcome they received and are proud to have been able to perpetuate this tradition of the French Navy.
The French Navy is part of the French Armed forces in New Caledonia (FANC); FANC enable France to have permanent military presence in the South Pacific in order to protect French interests in the region and maintain France's military partnerships in this area of strategic interest. With more than 1,650 military personnel, the FANC provide regular support for missions involving government action at sea. They have the capacity to intervene in the event of a security or climatic crisis affecting the area. The FANC regularly share their expertise in the field of HADR and maritime security with the security and defense forces of partner countries in the South Pacific.
As such, France, alongside PNG, is an actor of the regional security, for a free, safe and secured, prosperous and sustainable Pacific, and in particular South Pacific."

ENB loses pioneer premier,11/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3539,,Politics,Sadness,Nill,"East New Britain province has lost one of its most prominent and respected figures in politics with the passing of former Premier and Regional Member, Patuana Ereman Vin ToBaining. He died peacefully at his residence in Malapau, Kokopo, on February 24, 2025, at the age of 93. ToBaining's legacy lives on through his youngest son, Ereman ToBaining Jnr, who currently serves as the Open Member for Kokopo.
ToBaining's political journey began when he was first elected as the Premier of East New Britain province in May 1977, although he was soon replaced due to a compromise with the powerful Mataungan hardliners, who exerted significant influence over the Provincial Assembly, ToBaining continued to make his mark in the assembly, serving as Minister for Finance, Transport, and Works. He was later elected Premier again in September 1979, serving until his resignation in 1980.
His commitment to public service did not wane, as he continued to represent the Raluana district until April 1982 when he set his sights on national politics.
In June 1982, he was elected as the Regional Member of Parliament for East New Britain province, securing re-election in 1987 and serving until June 1992, when he was unable to garner the support of the Pangu Party for his continued tenure.
Tragedy struck ToBaining in 1988 with the passing of his eldest son, Kepas, followed closely by the loss of his beloved wife, Relvie, shortly after his election defeat in June 1992. These personal losses deeply affected him, leading him to withdraw from the political arena and allowing the younger generation to take the reins.
In his later years, ToBaining chose a quieter lifestyle in his home at Malapau, where he lived peacefully until his death. He left behind a legacy of political integrity and dedication to his province and its people.
Born to humble beginnings, Patuana Ereman Vin ToBaining was the son of Vin Ereman Tene, who served as a village police officer (Luluai) under both the German and Australian colonial administrations. ToBaining's early experiences with colonial governance instilled in him a sense of discipline, order, and a commitment to public service.
He completed Form 3 education at Bitapetep Lukbuk School but ultimately chose to follow in his father's footsteps rather than continue his academic pursuits, focusing on community service and leadership.
ToBaining was a father to seven children—five boys and two girls—Kepas, Piniana, Michael, Robert, Rubbie, and Ereman ToBaining Jnr. He also leaves behind a legacy of 30 grandchildren and 45 great-grandchildren.
His political aspirations ignited in the 1960s as he actively promoted indigenous causes and supported decolonization through the Warbete political group in East New Britain. His activism gained momentum, leading to his election to the first East New Britain Provincial Assembly in 1977, where he represented the Raluana local level government.
The passing of Patuana Ereman Vin ToBaining marks the end of an era for East New Britain, and the community remembers him as a dedicated public servant and a champion for the rights and aspirations of his people. His contributions to the province's political landscape will not be forgotten.
The body of the late ToBaining is currently placed at the Port Moresby funeral home, where it will remain until being repatriated to Kokopo this Friday. Upon arrival, it will lay in state, allowing family, friends, and community members to pay their respects before the casket is officially handed back to his clan.
A funeral service for ToBaining will be held at the Bitapetep United Church on Sunday, followed by his burial at his family tomb in Malapau. This gathering is expected to bring together many who were touched by his leadership and dedication to the community, as they honor his memory and legacy."
Sawang highlights importance of women in development,11/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3537,,Society,Anger,Kessy Sawang,"In the PNG labor market, workforce participation rate for women is 50.6 percent compared to 53.1 percent for men.
However, they face a much larger gap in formal employment, where only 25 percent of the workforce are women.
Additionally, there is an average earnings gap of 13.7 percent between men and women, which is both unjust and economically counterproductive, says the Labor Minister and Member for Raicoast, Kessy Sawang.
She added that studies suggest that if women participated equally in the labor market, the national income could be 20 percent higher.
“With Papua New Guinea’s real national income estimated at K75.7 billion in 2025, this means we are forgoing an additional K15 billion due to gender disparities. “
“This is not just a call for fairness, it is a call for national prosperity. As part of my ministerial duties, I will be advocating for labor law amendments to eliminate workplace discrimination and enhance opportunities for women in business enterprises,” Sawang stated.
Sawang shared these data during the Divine Word Graduation in Madang last week Friday, 07 March 2025 as Papua New Guinea joined the rest of the world to observe and celebrate International Women’s Day.
Minister Sawang highlighted that the issue of gender equality ‘demands attention’, adding that the graduation was timely to reflect on the state of gender representation in the country.
While progress has been made, she said there is still a long way to go. Taking female representation at the National Parliament as an example, where there are only three women representatives among 118 members, she said this represents just 2.5 per cent despite women making up 47.9% of population.
Sawang concluded saying, “Gender equality is not just a woman’s issue; it is everybody’s business. Men must be active allies in creating an equitable society."
Counter-terrorism operations set to transform law and order in PNG,11/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3536,,Security,Trust,Nill,"As the nation grapples with rising law and order issues, Police Commissioner David Manning has assured the people of Papua New Guinea that they will make this place safer as soon the counter-terrorism operations take place.
Manning provided this assurance after the Counter-Terrorism Joint Security Task Force (CTJSTF) had a meeting and set in place initial plans to combat current terrorist threats that present against the people of Papua New Guinea and overall national security.
At the first CTJSTF Meeting on the weekend in Port Moresby, the Task Force leadership headed by Police Commissioner, David Manning, and senior RPNGC and PNGDF, articulated operational requirements for the coming year.
“The creation of the JSTF, under the Counter-Terrorism Act, gives security forces stronger legislated authority to take down the criminals that terrorise, kidnap, rape and kill in our communities,” Commissioner Manning said.
“Terrorist acts are hurting our people and the Counter-Terrorism JSTF is tasked with assessing and planning counter-terrorist operations to apprehend the people who commit these atrocities. “The first JSTF meeting reviewed the legislative framework, considered current threat assessments, and examined immediate upskilling necessary to achieve proactive operational outcomes to stop terrorist activities.
“While details of what we agreed and the plans that are now in motion remain are classified for obvious security reasons, the people of our country can rest assured that they will be safer as these operations take place.
“Terrorists will be identified, located and arrested. The formation of tactical, intelligence and technical elements under the command of the JSTF will ensure that our operations are intelligence lead and conducted with surgical precision.”
The CTJSTF Executive is comprised of five members, with Commissioner Manning as Commander, a deputy from the RPNGC and the PNGDF, and three other senior uniformed personnel.
“Working together, supported through the authority provided by the Counter-Terrorism Act, we will turn the tide against those who terrorise communities and commit acts of terror.
“I thank the Marape-Rosso Government for its confidence in strengthening the laws of the Nation so that security forces can effectively deploy to remove terrorists from our streets.”"

Minister Peter commended the Acting Director of NOCFS, Jerry Wap, for his leadership in taking the necessary steps to address child protection concerns.
“This is a milestone achievement for the Marape-Rosso government in safeguarding the safety and welfare of our children.
“The government through the NOCFS is working hard to tackle issues affecting street children and child welfare. But every time, parents and guardians must take responsibility. Children are not just our future; they are our present, given by God. We must take good care of them,” Minister Peter said.
He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to working with provincial and district authorities to decentralize child protection services starting from the National Capital District.
In his opening remarks, Wap acknowledged the minister, agency heads, development partners, NGOs, and other attendees. He delivered an emotional tribute to the late Simon Yanis, the former director who played a key role in establishing NOCFS.
“Today, we launch the achievements made during my three-month tenure as Acting Director. For too long, children have suffered from abuse, neglect, and exploitation. We cannot continue to ignore these issues.”
“Our theme is ‘Change a Generation, Shape the Future.’ We will start by identifying street children, collecting data, and integrating them back into their families.”
“NOCFS, in partnership with stakeholders, would begin identifying and processing street children in the National Capital District (NCD) from March 10, 2025, before expanding to other urban areas.
“We have no time to wait. Our hotline is now active to respond to street children and all child protection issues nationwide,” Wap said.
Department for Community Development and Religion Secretary, Jerry Ubase, provided insights into the governance structure of NOCFS, highlighting its alignment with the Lukautim Pikinini Act.
“The Council reflects a collaborative commitment to addressing child welfare issues. I thank development partners like UNICEF, Save the Children, government agencies, NGOs, and churches for their efforts,” Ubase said.
UNICEF Chief Child Protection Officer, Paula Vargas, praised the initiative, citing alarming global statistics.

Combating GBV in the workplace,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3531,,Social,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed a new partnership with the PNG Trade Union Congress (PNGTUC) in a collaborative effort to combat workplace harassment and gender-based violence (GBV).
The initiative aims to introduce stronger policies, advocacy programmes, and legal frameworks to protect women and girls in the workforce and beyond.
At a high-level meeting, PNGTUC General Secretary Clemence Kanau highlighted the critical role of trade unions in addressing GBV and workplace harassment, stating that this issue has never been formally tackled in employment contracts before.
“GBV is a serious problem. As unions, we have fought for workers’ rights for many years, but this is one issue that has never been properly addressed in our workplaces,” Kanau said.
“We want to collaborate with the Employers’ Federation and other stakeholders to develop a policy that will make workplace harassment a dismissible offence. This is something new, and we are committed to making it work.”
Kanau further outlined PNGTUC’s nationwide approach, which includes advocacy in schools, workplaces, and rural communities to educate young boys and girls about the importance of respect, safeguarding women, and rejecting violence.
“We must train boys and girls in classrooms so they understand why violence is wrong and learn to protect their sisters and mothers,” he added.
“This will not only empower women but also create a generation of men who stand against violence.”
Prime Minister Marape commended PNGTUC’s initiative and agreed that legal amendments may be necessary to incorporate anti-harassment and anti-violence clauses into employment contracts.
“This is a powerful and necessary step,” Marape said.
“We already have workplace policies that address harassment, but they are often confined to specific organisations. It’s time to expand these protections across all sectors and make them a national standard.”
The Prime Minister reiterated that combating GBV is not just about workplace policies—it starts in the home.
He noted that abusive behaviour, whether by men or women, must be addressed at its root cause to create a society where violence is unacceptable in every form.
“Leadership starts in the home. If a person is found to be abusive—whether it’s a man towards a woman or vice versa—there must be consequences. We must change our national mindset,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
Kanau also emphasised the importance of engaging international organisations, diplomatic missions, and development partners in this effort. PNGTUC plans to work closely with the United Nations, employers’ groups, and civil society organisations to ensure this initiative is well-resourced and effectively implemented.
“Unions have been fighting for workers’ rights for years, but often governments do not listen to us,” Kanau said.
“However, because of our democratic foundation, unions remain a critical voice in society. This collaboration is our first major step towards institutionalizing protections against workplace harassment and GBV.”
PNGTUC’s strategy includes:
-	Developing curriculum-based advocacy programmes in schools to educate young people about gender equality and violence prevention.
-	Strengthening link with rural communities to ensure that anti-violence messages reach all Papua New Guineans, not just those in urban centres.
-	Incorporating GBV protections into labour laws and workplace policies to ensure victims are protected and offenders are held accountable.
As part of PNG’s 50th anniversary of independence commemorations, the Prime Minister emphasised that addressing GBV and workplace harassment must be a key part of the country’s long-term development goals.
“This issue is not just about workplace policies—it is about creating a safer, more respectful society.
“As we reflect on our nation’s journey over the past 50 years, let us make a commitment to ensuring that our next 50 years are defined by equality, justice, and respect for all.”
The government, in collaboration with PNGTUC, will work towards legislative changes, workplace reforms, and national awareness campaigns to ensure that violence and harassment in any form are no longer tolerated in Papua New Guinea."
Female police officers commended,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3517,,Community,Trust,Nill,"The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary NCD Command joined hands with the rest of the world to celebrate International Women's Day on Friday, March 7th.
This year, the command changed its location to host the event at Gerehu Police Station due to the many deaths involving women that are occurring in the Gerehu area.
Under the theme Accelerate Action for gender equality, the celebration headed by the PNG-Australia Policing Partnership (APP) brought together women of the force, both uniform and non-uniform, to remember and value their contribution to the police force.
The event was witnessed by NCD/Central Commander Benjamin Turi and representatives of the APP.
According to Turi, a proactive approach must be taken to address issues affecting women not just on special occasions but daily.
Turi said women in the police force have contributed enormously to the growth of the force over the years and have continued to do so despite facing challenges with their male counterparts or facing violence at home.
“Their efforts are a testimony to the positions they are holding in the force, such as the FSVU directorate and recent promotion of two female officers who are now second in charge of Boroko and Waigani Police Station,” said Turi.
He encouraged all female officers to work hard and excel in whatever role they hold in the force and not be discouraged by their male counterparts.
The ACP further urged male officers to respect female officers and work collaboratively with them to serve the community in the law and justice sector."
Cocoa Board focuses on expansion,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3528,,Business,Anticipation,James Marape,"The Cocoa Board presented an ambitious 2025 strategy, focusing on expanding production, improving quality control, and enhancing export opportunities.
A key initiative in 2025 will be establishing a regional hub for cocoa development in Jiwaka Province.
""For the first time, we are introducing a large-scale cocoa development project in the Highlands,” Chief executive officer for Cocoa Board, Jesse Anjen announced.
""We have signed a MoA with the Jiwaka Provincial Government to establish a seed garden, a clonal budwood garden, and a regional cocoa distribution centre.”
This project aims to:
-	Increase cocoa cultivation in the Highlands region.
-	Provide improved planting materials to farmers.
-	Develop nurseries in key Highland provinces like Simbu, Eastern Highlands, and Western Highlands.
The Cocoa Board also plans to shift the industry towards more local processing and value addition.
“Instead of just exporting raw beans, we must invest in downstream processing to produce cocoa liquor, butter, and premium chocolate products locally,” Anjen stressed.
He said more funding will be sought to establish processing facilities that support local cocoa-based industries and public-private partnership is encouraged to build chocolate and confectionery processing plants.
Anjen said PNG will continue to expand its presence in global fine-flavour cocoa markets.
“Our goal is to increase PNG’s market share in the premium cocoa sector, particularly in Europe and North America.
“We will work with international partners to promote PNG cocoa in high-end chocolate industries.""
Therefore, Anjen said the Cocoa Board is requesting K20 million in funding under the Development Investment Programme (DIP) for 2025 to support its expansion plans.
“Government support is critical to helping our cocoa farmers thrive. We need more investments in research, extension services, and value chain development.”
""We are building a sustainable cocoa industry that benefits both farmers and the national economy. “With the right investments, infrastructure, and policy support, PNG can become one of the world’s leading producers of fine flavour cocoa,” Anjen said.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister James Marape acknowledged the Cocoa Board’s impressive progress and ambitious vision for the industry.
“Cocoa is a key revenue earner for Papua New Guinea, and we must invest in its future.
“The government will support efforts to expand cocoa farming into new regions, build better processing industries, and improve market access for farmers.”
He commended cocoa farmers and industry leaders for their resilience and commitment, urging more collaboration between government agencies and the private sector to drive growth.
With a clear roadmap for 2025 and beyond, the Cocoa Board of PNG is determined to expand production, improve quality, and enhance value addition."
New ablution for Butibam primary,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3527,,Education,Sadness,Nill,"It has been years since Butibam Primary School saw a new building in the schoolgrounds at Bumbu.
Despite being located in Lae City, the school has termite-ridden buildings, no proper teachers’ resources and a lack of student learning materials. Even the blackboards in some of the classrooms have been eaten by termites.
School is suspended when it rains, while students are sent out of the classroom on windy days, in case the double-storey building comes crashing down.
The Butibam Pipeline Landowners Association came to the students' aid with the construction of a K350,000 ablution facility that was officially opened on Friday, March 7th.
The association, which is one of six impact landowner groups of the Wafi-Golpu project, has prioritised education and health using the infrastructure development grant from the State.
“We’ve focused on education institutions within the catchment areas,” outlined the chairman of the Butibam Pipeline Landowners Association, Peter Kesu-Sayama.
“So, Busu Secondary School, Amba Demonstration Primary School, Butibam Primary School, we’ve got Butibam elementary inside the village; we’ve allocated funding for infrastructure development.
“Busu, we’ve given them a bus with a total donation worth K200,000. Amba Demonstration we’ve built the same ablution facility for K350,000. Butibam elementary, we’ve allocated K200,000 to rebuild a rundown classroom.
“We’re also looking at the health sector within the community. We feel there’s a need for an aid-post in the village so we’ve put some money aside to construct a facility as well as look at the procurement of medication.”
After tax, the landowner association was left with an IDG value of K2.7 million from the gross value of K3 million.
Head teacher of Butibam primary, John Jigembe, said the school is looking forward to celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and the project was timely.
He said the primary school has been unable to maintain its infrastructure because the Government Tuition Fee Subsidy is insufficient. Furthermore, since he started in 2017, he attributed the school’s neglect to the lack of school fee payments by parents."
SDP launches Morehead Health Centre,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3524,,Health,Joy,"Elias Kapavore, Sekie Agisa, Taboi Awi Yoto","The newly upgraded Morehead Health Centre in South Fly District, Western Province opened recently and is ready to provide vital health services to rural communities.
Morehead is one of the most remote communities in Western and in the country, with the hospital providing essential health services for over 30,000 people within the Morehead catchment area.
Over one thousand people including government and development partners gathered to witness the official opening of the SDP-funded newly upgraded Morehead Health.
The opening of the Morehead Health Centre reflects the vision of SDP’s Gutpela Community Strategy 2025-2030 to anchor its efforts and priorities in Western Province complementing the efforts of the local government and other key stakeholders.
In her address to the Morehead people, SDP Board Director Dame Meg Taylor expressed her gratitude to those who came to celebrate the occasion, including Minister for Health Elias Kapavore.
The health centre which was approved for construction in 2022, is a testament to the Public-Private Partnership between SDP and the Western Provincial Health Authority (WPHA).
“It has taken two and half years, 15 ship voyages, and 121 employees to complete this health facility at a total cost of over K52 million,” Dame Meg said.
The health centre boasts a suite of modern facilities, including a labor ward and maternity services, general inpatient care, laboratory services, a pharmacy, a central sterile services department, dental care and an operating theatre for minor surgeries.
As well as improving the range of healthcare services available to the Morehead community, the facility will also reduce referrals to Daru, ensuring more accessible treatment for the people.
Minister Kapavore, in his keynote address, applauded the effort of SDP, and stated that the facility was aligned with the government’s health vision of “all citizens having the fundamental right to accessible healthcare wherever they are”.
The Minister also stated his commitment to support SDP’s request to upgrade the facility to Level 4
accreditation elevating it to district hospital status. The centre is staffed with two doctors, two Health Extension Officers, and twenty medical and support staff. However, the Level 4 certification will mean further support from the government in allocating more health workers and doctors to the hospital.
South Fly MP and Minister for Livestock, Sekie Agisa was grateful for SDP’s partnership, voicing his confidence that the facility and its staff will be protected.
“It is our privilege to take ownership of this property”, he said, responding to Dame Meg’s comments about safeguarding the centre for future generations.
SDP’s health program is focused on strengthening drug supply chains, essential medical equipment, and health worker capacity through a new Nursing School in Balimo. SDP’s preventative health intervention employs health workers on 12 patrol teams serving 74 rural river and airstrip communities and reaching over 78,000 people across all four districts of Western Province.
Meantime, Western Province Governor, Taboi Awi Yoto recognised SDP as a key development partner, acknowledging its new strategy of investing in the people of Western Province."

"Five suspects arrested, three released",10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3514,,Crime,Anger,Nill,"Five suspects who were involved in the alleged rape and murder of the late Margaret Gabriel in Baruni in Port Moresby recently have been arrested and detained at the Boroko Holding Cell.
NCD/Central Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi confirmed this.
Turi said the five suspects are separate from the three suspects, who were arrested earlier as police found no evidence and were released.
“Gerehu police picked the three suspects from the street and brought them in. After screening, we released them due to lack of evidence. But we are positive about the involvement of the five suspects,” Turi said.
Meanwhile, Turi said the PNG Defence Force Soldier Mileng Kapli is still on the run. Despite notifying the police of his intention to surrender, he still did not turn himself in.

The ACP added that the police are still searching for the suspect who escaped while in custody following the willful murder of late Edwina Aiba Oa in Bereina, Central Province."
Riverine communities call for CEPA’s interventions,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3518,,Environment,Anger,Nill,"The Porgera Riverine Landowners have again called on the government and the Environment & Conservation Protection Authority (CEPA) to honor its commitment made to the Porgera Riverine Communities during the transfer of the environment permit.
The government of PNG and the CEPA are facing mounting criticism for their failure to conduct an environmental audit for the riverine communities adversely affected by the discharge of mine waste into the Porgera River.
According to a local leader representing the riverine communities and chairman of the Porgera River Alluvial Miners Association, Peter Papo, this negligence has been a source of ongoing concern, particularly in light of the controversial environmental permit issued in 1988, which was granted without a compensation agreement, and the recent transfer of this permit from Barrick to NPL without even conducting an Environmental audit to verify and assess complains raised by the affected communities.
Mr Papo said “During the transfer process, CEPA MD acknowledged and admitted past mistakes and committed to conducting an environmental audit before the recommencement of mining operations but, this promise now appears to be another instance of empty assurances, further exacerbating the distress of affected communities”
“We have raised environmental concerns since 1989 when the Porgera mine first began discharging waste into the river. The people of Lower Porgera, as well as the river communities, rely on this river for their survival, including the practice of alluvial mining. The government must not continue to ignore the plight of the river people”
“For over three decades, CEPA and the government of PNG have neglected the needs and rights of the Porgera River people, failing to conduct a comprehensive environmental audit despite repeated requests from affected communities,” Mr Papo emphasized.
He said “Three different Chief Secretaries to the government have issued explicit directives for CEPA to prioritize this audit, yet the agency continues to let down the landowners and communities that depend on the river.”
Considering these ongoing issues, Mr Papo is appealing to CEPA to urgently fulfill its commitment and conduct an environmental audit without further delay.
The health and livelihoods of the Porgera Riverine communities hang in the balance, and the government must take immediate action to address these critical environmental concerns.
“We call upon CEPA to act decisively and transparently to restore trust and ensure the well-being of the communities that have suffered for far too long.”"
ENB youths graduate with Commercial Fishing Operation Certificates,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3523,,Business,Joy,Nill,"Six young women are among 35 trainees in East New Britain who recently graduated with certificates in Commercial Fishing Operations Level One (CFO1).
Provincial Division of Fisheries and Marine Resources acting advisor, Enoch Pabon when speaking during the graduation at Rabaul Waterfront recently said the prerequisite for the CFO1 training follows an established MOA with the ENB Government and National Fisheries Authority (NFA) for fisheries management and training development in the province, and to pave way for formal employment.
The 6-week training held at Rabaul Waterfront in Rabaul town was facilitated by the National Fisheries College (NFC) for students from Woolnough, Milamila and Namatanai Vocational Schools. This is the second batch of students in ENB to graduate from this collaborative arrangement.
Mr Pabon said the CF01 is a competent course targeting trainees to seek employment on board fishing vessels and merchant ships either working as seafarers or deck hands and eventually make their way up to be captains or work in the engine room as motorman or chief engineers.
The CFO1 training packages include Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), first aid, seafarer’s handbook and fishing on board NFC MV Pokajam.
Team leader for NFC’s Commercial Fishing Operation Program, Captain Jerry Bagat highlighted similar trainings at NFC and ENB has seen more than 95 percent of students now working on vessels.
“Many females that underwent the CFO1 training are now working on vessels. This current batch is privileged to have 6 female trainees,” Cpt Bagat said.
“This field is dominated by males and I encourage our young women, if you want to become sea women, you must speak the same language as your male counterparts. To become a captain or a chief engineer is not impossible.”
According to the Provincial Division of Fisheries and Marine Resources, they will continue this partnership through the MOA to build capacity as ENB prepares to deliver fisheries investments projects such as the Rabaul Tuna Terminal, Rural/district jetties and onshore facility development that will ultimately create job opportunities."

PM Marape underscores important role of women in society,8/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3504,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has called on all Papua New Guineans, especially men, to respect, protect, and support women in all aspects of life as the nation marks International Women’s Day 2025.
Reflecting on the significance of this global occasion, Prime Minister Marape emphasised that respect for women is the foundation of a strong and progressive society.
He reminded the nation that Papua New Guinea’s national anthem calls for ""all arise, sons of this land,"" and stated that now, more than ever, men must rise to defend, love, and protect the women of this country.
“It is our duty as men to look after our women, our girls, our mothers, and our sisters,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Leadership begins in the home, and the strength of our nation is measured by how we treat our women.”
Citing the biblical story of Adam and Eve, Prime Minister Marape underscored that women are equal partners in the home, workplace, and national development. He reiterated that men and women are one, and true progress can only be achieved when women are respected, valued, and empowered.
“As Papua New Guinea stands at the threshold of its 50th anniversary of independence, I call on all men to reflect on their role in ensuring that women are safe, supported, and given equal opportunities to contribute to our country’s growth,” he said.
Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed his government's commitment to gender equality and women’s empowerment, stressing that without fundamental respect for women, all other efforts for national
development would be meaningless.
“Women are the foundation of our society-they give birth to our population, they nurture, they lead, and they contribute immensely to our communities. We must ensure that our country is one where women can thrive without fear or discrimination,” he added.
On this International Women's Day, Prime Minister Marape urged every Papua New Guinean to not just celebrate the achievements of women but to actively promote respect, equality, and safety for all women."
Overcoming challenges: Lillian Gurina,7/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3489,,Business,Joy,Nill,"Starting out cleaning office spaces on minimum wage, to now overseeing a G4S fleet team of 56 staff and 48 vehicles, Fleet Coordinator for TotalEnergies, Lillian Gurina, is a brilliant example of how hard work truly pays off.
Having worked in Construction, Transportation and now Oil and Gas, Lillian is no stranger to being the only female in male-led teams. She is an all-rounder who constantly challenges herself and those around her to aspire for more, believing that there is no limit to how much one can learn.
“When it comes to my work, I apply this saying: you don’t wait for things to happen to react to them - you have to foresee, so when you are planning, you have to take those things into consideration,” she says.
Proud of her Koiari heritage, Lillian is the second youngest of five siblings, raised by her older sister after their dad passed away when she was younger.
Completing all of her schooling in Sogeri, she attended Sogeri Elementary and Primary School, Iarowari High School and continued on to Sogeri National High School for her Secondary School diploma.
She had attended College in East New Britian, studying building and architecture, but was unable to complete her course.
After keeping herself busy with baby sitting and side jobs, Lillian participated in a short course, to upgrade her knowledge on computer hardware and obtained a diploma in Information Technology (IT) in 2014.
“In 2015, there was a Construction company, NC Civil Works, building our road and they were looking for someone to clean their office and I was recommended for the job,” she shares.
“I worked as an office attendant for a month and then the Managing Director noticed I was capable of doing more so decided to try me out for an admin assistant position. I did that from September 2015 to April 2016 and then I became Project Admin, until I left in 2018,” she adds.
Through her project admin role, she grew comfortable learning more about the roles of everyone involved in construction and engineering because she had a hands-on involvement on all administrative related operations.
“In 2019 I joined China Railway Construction Engineering. I was the Project site Admin HR and the only national woman (at the time), out of a project team of 100+ men from Indonesia, China and Papua New Guinea that built the Able Computing Office complex,” she states.
Taking a break in 2020, she returned to NC Civil Works in 2021 to help out for a few months, feeling grateful to her former boss Nicholas Constantinou for helping her with her starting position and credits him for shaping her into the professional she is now.
“He is the reason why I am, where I am. We were trained tough – he was a very tough boss but I got used that leadership style and appreciate it because it prepared me to always be on top of things and plan ahead,” she says.
While she was back with NC Civil works, she applied for the position of Fleet Coordinator with TotalEnergies after noticing it on LinkedIn. Although she was asked to go in for an interview, she was not successful but did receive a favourable offer from Ela Motors, so joined in late 2021.
Working as a Fleet Support officer with Ela Motors for one year and credits her time at Ela Motors for learning more about vehicles in general and the processes in place for fleet customers, which has come in handy for her current role.
“It was challenging (at Ela Motors) because of the number of branches and customers but I enjoyed my time there, I learnt so much. I was part of the team that looked after fleet customers and then we also provided guidance to the service departments of the 16 branches,” she says.
Joining TotalEnergies in March 2023 as Fleet Admin, she was promoted to the position of Coordinator in October 2024, working closely and learning as much as she can from the Fleet Superintendent.
“My job is to make sure that the vehicles are safe, that the staff are transported to and from, the drivers are happy and to make sure that the people who help us by providing us drivers are paid,” she says.
“It has been interesting thus far, my time with TotalEnergies. This is my first Oil & Gas job, which is what enticed me to apply in the first place so I’m enjoying learning from all my colleagues,” she affirms.
Grateful for all of her experiences, she would like to believe that she has left an impact during her time within the different companies.
“I’m not an avid Church goer but the main thing is that I have faith in the Lord and in where he is leading me. Learn to accept failure and rejection and rely on God to lead you to where he needs you to be,” she says."
Raicoast commits to develop center,7/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3492,,Development,Anticipation,"Jason Peter, Kessy Sawang","The Rai Coast District Development Authority (DDA) this week officially signed a contract with the Department for Community Development and Religion for the construction of a District Community Development Centre (DCDC).
Following the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 2024, the contract was signed by Minister for Labour and Employment and Rai Coast MP Kessy Sawang; Youth, Religion, and Community Development Minister, Jason Peter; Department Secretary, Jerry Ubase; Rai Coast District CEO, Hans Tanguri; and Linguan & CO Limited Managing Director, Yunlin Guan.
Minister Peter thanked Minister Sawang and her team for supporting the project, which aims to serve vulnerable groups, including women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.
“This project aligns with the government’s broader goal to strengthen services in rural areas through the ‘Going Rural Initiative.’ We are focusing on rural development and aim to build more such centers across the country,” Minister Peter said.
Secretary Ubase highlighted the importance of bringing government services closer to the people.
“Similar to other DCDCs, the new two-story facility will feature over 50 workstations on the upper floor, with conference facilities on the ground floor. The office spaces will be allocated to community development officers, various ministerial agencies, government departments, and partner organizations.
“We will also build a transit lodge to provide a safe house for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) and sorcery-related violence. The facility will be securely fenced, with a standby generator and water storage tanks,” Ubase explained.
Minister Sawang acknowledged Minister Peter and Secretary Ubase for their leadership and support in establishing the DCDC project.
“Rai Coast has lacked a proper district office for over a decade, making service delivery challenging. This new building will help bridge this gap and establish a stronger government presence in the region,” she said.
She also urged the contractor and the department to complete the project by September 16, in time for the country’s 50th Golden Jubilee celebrations.
“I want to give this building as a 50-year Jubilee gift to the people of Rai Coast. Now that the department and contractor are here, we must complete it before September 16 so our people can see that the government cares,” she added.
Once the district funding component is paid, the department will counter-fund the project and give the green light for the contractor to begin mobilization and construction."
"Claribel Waide, championing education equality",7/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3501,,Education,Joy,"Kinoka Hotune Feo, Lucas Dekena","As the world marks International Women’s Day on March 8, 2025, PNG Partnerships for Improving Education (PNG PIE) celebrates the remarkable journey of Claribel Waide, a dedicated advocate for Gender Equity and Social Inclusion (GESI) in Papua New Guinea’s education sector.
Hailing from Oro and Morobe Provinces, Claribel’s educational journey began at Okapa Community School, where her father was a teacher. She later attended Kafetina Community School before completing Grade 10 at Henganofi High School.
Inspired by her father, she pursued teacher training at Balob Teacher’s College in Morobe Province. However, during her second year, tragedy struck-her father passed away.
“As the eldest, I was devastated. I wanted to quit, but I remembered his words: ‘Study hard, secure a job, and look after your siblings,’” she recalled.
Determined to honor his wishes, Claribel persevered. After graduating, she returned to Oro and taught for over eight years, financially supporting her four younger siblings through university.
Inspired by their success, she pursued higher education, graduating from the University of Papua New Guinea with a degrees in Arts (Education) and Business Management (Public Policy Management).
With her qualifications, Claribel secured a role in the National Department of Education’s Human Resources Division as a GESI Officer. She spearheaded training, advocacy, and policy integration to mainstream gender equity across the education system.
Her efforts culminated in the launch of the GESI in Schools Policy at the Teachers Expo in September 2024, officiated by Pat Conroy, Kinoka Hotune Feo, and Lucas Dekena.
“I feel a sense of satisfaction, as it was a long and challenging journey,” Claribel said, acknowledging the support of colleagues and the Australian Government’s Partnerships for Improving Education program.
Claribel’s work focuses on breaking barriers for marginalised groups, including girls, children with disabilities, and students from remote areas. She conducts training workshops for teachers and community leaders, ensuring culturally inclusive and gender-sensitive teaching approaches.
Additionally, she supports research and data collection to inform policy decisions and track progress towards inclusive education goals.
Excited about the policy’s impact, Claribel believes it will promote accountability among stakeholders, ensuring all children-especially girls and those with disabilities-attend school and complete their education.
“This policy will hold everyone accountable for supporting children’s education,” she said.

These workshops, held across the country’s four regions, in Port Moresby, Mt. Hagen, Kimbe and Wewak, provided an inclusive platform for sub-national stakeholders to contribute to PNG’s funding proposal under the GCF RBP Pilot Programme.
Participants included representatives from national and sub-national government agencies, civil society organizations, the private sector, academia, and development partners. The discussions focused on PNG’s REDD+ achievements, the GCF RBP funding proposal, and jurisdictional REDD+ opportunities, including ART/TREES and the LEAF Coalition.
The workshops also addressed environmental and social safeguards, gender action plans, and grievance redress mechanisms. Stakeholders provided valuable feedback, which will be incorporated into the final funding proposal submission to the GCF Secretariat.
CCDA’s Acting Managing Director, Debra Sungi, emphasized the significance of these consultations in ensuring a transparent and inclusive approach to climate finance.
“The engagement and contributions from stakeholders at the regional level have been invaluable. These discussions have strengthened PNG’s position in securing funding that will drive sustainable forest management and support our national climate targets,” she stated.
With the workshops now complete, CCDA and its partners will finalize the funding proposal, integrating stakeholder insights to strengthen PNG’s application will be submitted on the 30th of March 2025 and await approval by the GCF Board which will sit for their bi-annual board meeting mid this year where PNG will host in June 2025 in Port Moresby.
CCDA emphasizes that they remain committed to advancing climate action and securing financial resources to reinvest in sustainable development initiatives."

EU provides grants support women’s empowerment,7/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3496,,Global,Anticipation,Peter Tsiamalili Jr.,"The United Nation’s campaign around International Women’s Day this year, emphasizes the need to Accelerate Action to achieve gender equality. The theme, “For ALL women and girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment” underlines the increased momentum and urgency in addressing the systemic barriers and biases that women face, both in personal and professional spheres.
Globally, significant progress has been made towards achieving gender equality and women and girl’s empowerment. Despite the progress, women and girls’ rights continue to be violated around the world including in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
To address these ongoing challenges, the European Union (EU) has developed the Roadmap for Women's Rights, a strategic plan focused on advancing gender equality by combating gender-based violence, protecting women’s and girls’ rights, and ensuring equal opportunities in all areas of society. This is reflected in the EU’s targeted support, which provides funding exclusively to PNG Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) working to promote and protect human rights.
The EU sees CSOs as crucial for human rights, democracy, and stability, helping to improve livelihoods, support small producers and women, and shape policies that reduce inequalities. CSOs promote accountability, human rights, and transparency by providing free information and monitoring governance, corruption, and policy impact.
In 2024, the EU Delegation launched a Call for Proposals focused on 'Women’s Economic Empowerment and Leadership,' aiming to remove barriers to market access, investment, and business development for women, including marginalized groups, youth, and those with disabilities. The initiative promotes inclusive economic opportunities and supports the transition from informal to small or medium-sized businesses.
Today, the EU Delegation signed two new contracts supporting women’s economic empowerment in PNG, while commemorating International Women’s Day 2025. These two projects will be implemented by World Vision PNG and the Specialty Coffee Association of PNG.
World Vision will receive a 3.5 million kina (EUR 818,750) grant project to support 150 women entrepreneurs in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville. This project called, “Sapotim Strongpla Meri: Empowering AROB Women in Business” will support inclusive and equitable economic opportunities for women and youth by enhancing their knowledge, skills, capacity, and access to the market system in Central Bougainville.
The Specialty Coffee Association will receive a 3.5 million kina to enhance access to skills development, entrepreneurial training, financial services, and business leadership for women and girls in the specialty coffee value chain, including in the Highlands.
The ambassador thanked World Vision, the Specialty Coffee Association of PNG, the Government of Papua New Guinea, and civil society as a whole for their strong collaboration in advancing protect human rights, equal opportunity and gender equality.
The event was witnessed by Minister for Security and Bougainville Regional MP, Peter Tsiamalili Jr. and representatives from the civil society."
Collaborating to combat malnutrition,7/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3495,,Health,Trust,Nill,"The Child Nutrition and Social Protection (CNSP) Project Component Management Unit 2 (CMU 2) under the Department for Community Development and Religion signed a partnership contract with Save the Children on Tuesday 4 March, 2025.
The contract signing ceremony was witnessed by the Department’s Secretary, Jerry Ubase, CMU 2 team members, senior managers of the department, and Save the Children Country Director, Lisa Piper and her team.
CMU 2 Manager, Joseph Klapat, thanked Secretary Ubase and Deputy Karen Haive for their leadership in driving the rollout of this nutrition-sensitive project.
“It has taken extensive negotiations, but we are finally here to sign this agreement and formalize our partnership with a key organization that will help us move this project forward. We are very pleased to work with Save the Children,” said Klapat.
“Last year, we registered 1,760 beneficiaries (pregnant mothers and children under 2 years) across 11 wards in the four pilot provinces - East New Britain, Madang, Simbu, and Western, where a total of K115,530 in Child Nutrition Grant payments were disbursed.
“With this signing, we now look forward to expanding the scope of the project to new provinces and districts,” Klapat said.
Ubase commended Klapat and his team for their commitment to supporting children and mothers through the Child Grant initiative and also thanked Save the Children's Country Director, Lisa Piper, and her team for finalizing the partnership.
“Child malnutrition remained a challenge in PNG since independence, and the government has struggled to address it.
“With the National Social Protection Policy 2022-2030 now endorsed by the National Executive Council and set to be launched this month, we have a strategic framework to reduce stunting and improve the lives of marginalized and vulnerable people.
“With Save the Children on board, I believe the scope of the partnership would help expand the CNSP project’s impact in reducing child stunting in PNG,” Ubase said.
Piper thanked the CMU 2 Project team and the Secretary for the partnership, expressing her commitment to supporting efforts to reduce child malnutrition and stunting in the country."

Mine operations remain undisturbed with the general situation in the pit reported quiet and normal."
ENB works to address crime,7/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3494,,Government,Anticipation,Nill,"A meeting was held this week in East New Britain to address its persistent law and order issues.
It was facilitated by the East New Britain Provincial Member, Michael Marum, and ENB Provincial Administrator, Levi Mano, to discuss the government’s strategies.
In attendance were also Kokopo MP, Ereman Tobaining Jnr, Assistant Commissioner of Police – New Guinea Islands, Naua Vanuavaru, Kerevat Correctional Services Commander, Superintendent John Poris, and provincial church representative, Pastor Anthony Kivung.
Provincial Administrator Levi Mano reiterated the three main strategies by the provincial government to look at law and order in the short, medium and long term basis.
He said the immediate response on law and order obviously lies with the responsible government agency on the ground, which is the disciplinary forces, who respond on a daily basis to law and order issues.
“The short term strategy is how we assist the disciplinary forces. We have a specific program where we assist the police department with resources, as in fuel, logistics and also rations. But the execution part of it belongs to the police department, the courts and then the Correctional Services,” he stated.
He said apart from the support to the police department, the districts are conducting awareness in schools to target juveniles, especially in Rabaul district, with Kokopo district to follow suit.
The medium term strategy depends on the type of programs and their duration, and one of them is the rollout of training programs through the Division of Community Development.
“In 2024, we signed eight Service Level Agreements with service providers to engage them to conduct life skills training for youths in the wards. Those training needs were submitted by the LLGs in the province. And one of those service providers has been engaged to collect data on Grade 12 school leavers, from 2022 up to last year,” Mano added.
A report on those service providers is expected by the end of this month (March), to see how they have fared in the provision of the training, and that report will be further provided to the provincial government.
Mano said this year, they are engaging the Tertiary Students Christian Fellowship (TSCF) to do awareness among students in educational institutions.
Long term strategies are captured in the ENB 10-year Strategic Development Plan (2023 - 2033), under sectors such as land mobilisation, agriculture and livestock, tourism and fisheries, apart from infrastructure, commerce via SME support and education through reforms.
In this year’s budget, the family and community empowerment program, which comprises of funded micro-programs for family units, has been progressed under the law and justice sector.
Also under the government’s long term measures are church run programs, and the establishment of four police posts targeting hot spot areas for criminals, especially at the Gelagela resettlement, and then around the Nangananga-Vunamurmur area in Kokopo District, Pere at Melkoi LLG in Pomio District, and along the north coast road between Gazelle and Rabaul districts.
The province will also have a police reservists program running this year, co-funded by the provincial government and the Police Department.
Mano said the provincial government also recently endorsed 36 by-laws to be executed by the LLGs.
“These by-laws give the power and authority to the LLGs and the wards to create a law in their locality to address and maintain good peace and order.
“Those bylaws would be executed by the LLG, Ward Development Committees and the village courts, but awareness would be done by the districts on how to execute them, from issuing a order to police then to CS.”
The PA iterated that law and order is a shared responsibility, and is not entirely the provincial government’s job. Hence, decisions made are implemented by the public service into communities as the recipients, who also contribute to the law and order issues.
“I urge the people of ENB to help the provincial government and the administration execute these strategies, so that we all can say that we have worked together to ensure we have a peaceful community.”"
Inspirational Women in Leadership: Jean-Marie Yalibu,7/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3486,,Business,Joy,Nill,"Overcoming quite a lot to be where she is today, Jean-Marie Yalibu’s story serves as an inspiration to those currently going through a difficult situation that the Lord always provides and sees you through.
“Growing up in a mission home, I never thought that I would experience some of the struggles I went through in my life, so I firmly believe that God provides always and that the best teacher is life,” she says smiling.
Born and raised in Eastern Highlands, the Southern Highlands native and single mum of two is the General Services Manager for TotalEnergies.
“I’m the youngest of four and the only girl; I have three older brothers. My parents were missionaries, so I was born and raised in mission compound run by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), where missionaries come from all over the world, live and dedicate their life to the local communities by educating, training and translating the Scripture. SIL is in the outback of Eastern Highlands,” she explains.
Having been educated for most of her formative years in the quaint little mission compound, she went on to complete her secondary school at Aiyura National High School in 2009 and then moved to Lae to pursue a Diploma in Civil Engineering at the National Polytechnic Institute of PNG.
Completing her course in 2012, she got her first job with Shorncliffe 1965 Limited shortly after graduating, as a Site Engineer.
“I had the choice of whether I wanted to work or continue with my studies, but I chose to work because of the situation I was in at the time. My first job as a Site Engineer was for routine and emergency road maintenance works on the Highlands Highway from Lae Main Wharf to Yung Creek,” she said.
“I was pregnant with my first born and it was tiring but fulfilling to be out on the highway, in the hot sun during those ‘Road Doctor’ days, she added smiling.
Leaving Shorncliffe after a year and a half, she joined Regional Engineering and Construction (REC) Ltd in 2014 as a Site Manager working full time on site, for the construction of classrooms at Balop Teacher’s Training College in Lae Morobe Province.
“During that time that I was with REC, I wanted to continue my studies, and my employer granted approval to take courses at the International Training Institute (ITI) Lae campus. So, I worked during the day and studied at night – I took night classes,” she said.
In 2016, she was hired as Special Projects Manager at the Pacific Adventist University (PAU). Relocating to Port Moresby, she was with PAU for four years as a newly single mum, following the birth of her baby, even managing to complete the course she had started in Lae at ITI and graduated with a Diploma in Business Management from the Port Moresby campus.
“I chose to focus on my career and it became the support that I needed during the difficult times – I had found a purpose and a way to block out all the negative. Even if things were falling apart in my personal life, I would always show up to work on time and dedicated myself 100% to my career,” she explains.
She eventually moved on from PAU and joined Brian Bell Group under the Property Division. She continued her passion for her studies and decided to get her degree. Accumulating all her entitled days off, she studied at Divine Word University and graduated with a Bachelor of Business Management.
Noticing an ad for her current position posted on her social network page and then recommended to her by friends, she felt compelled to apply.
“I was interested but hesitant at the same time because I did not have experience in the Oil and Gas industry. I was encouraged to apply nonetheless so I took it upon myself to do research on TotalEnergies globally and the type of work they were doing in PNG,” she says.
As part of a fully national team, led by a national female director, it is her job to ensure a safe and healthy working environment, overseeing all office related matters in terms of residential, commercial building, critical equipment and housekeeping for the Upstream Logistics site in Gulf, the office in Port Moresby and the logistics site out at AES.
“There’s a common respect of how far someone has worked to be where they are and so I appreciate that. Working for a big company such as TotalEnergies has really helped take me out of my comfort zone,” she attests.
She credits God for bringing her this far in life, her children as being a huge driving force, and her parents, to be better for them.
She shares a reminder that when you join an organisation, if you have the right attitude and are willing to learn, you will go far in life.
“My educational journey is not over yet; I am planning to pursue my master’s in management by God’s grace and timing. I am grateful to be in a conducive working environment; there are colleagues here that have extensive knowledge in their own profession with Oil & Gas and I am privileged to work with them,” she says.
“I have good support from my managers and the team around me, everyone is supportive, it excels me to want better for myself and the services I manage here at TotalEnergies,” she added."
Women in STEM: Hua Morea,7/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3485,,Career,Joy,Nill,"The only female in a technical, male led team, Geographical Information System (GIS) Officer at TotalEnergies, Hua Morea, is completely in her element.
“I never feel challenged or like I have to compete with the guys. There is so much respect, understanding and support within the team and everyone has different strengths and we all work together to build that up,” she says.
“That’s what contributes to my growth, both professionally and personally. From the beginning of my time here, I would say that I wasn’t as professionally equipped, but the team has helped me sharpen the edges, they have helped me improve/grow so much,” she adds.
The 29-year-old from Hanuabada, is the first of four siblings in a family of six. She began her early childhood learning in her village, then went on to the Institute of Christian Academy, before graduating from Marianville Secondary School in 2015.
“I was at Marianville and then the following year I moved to Lae to pursue my degree in GIS. It was a completely new experience for me, I’m a family girl, so it was my first time to really be exposed to a new environment and different way of life,” she reveals.
“All my decisions up until that point, were or had been essentially centred around that (my family) so when I was away, I had to learn to take care of myself for the first time,” she added.
She attests that, even though she had not seriously thought about what she wanted to be, she knew that she had a passion for geography after finishing from high school and saw that as her deciding factor when she was choosing a path for university.
“I would say that my education, from high school all the way to completing my bachelors, I did that for my family and I think I did well. Right after me, my cousin sister followed and that made me proud,” she said.
“I’d like to feel that what I did was more than just attain a degree, I was out there breaking barriers, building a pathway for the next generation of my family to be inspired to go to school, all the way to tertiary and maybe beyond,” she added.
After she graduated in 2019 with a Bachelor of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) from the PNG University of Technology (UniTech), she had been hit with the stark reality of finding a job during the pandemic.
“Covid-19 was also happening, making it really hard to find work, but around the same time, there was a need for greater awareness on Covid, so I was paid to volunteer and raise awareness in the Motukoita villages,” she shares.
“We would go set up in the heart of the villages, in the public spaces and people would be invited to come and listen. It was a new experience and it was nice because it was in our language so I feel like the message was well communicated,” she added.
Following this she joined Darkon Consultancy firm as a GIS officer, working there for a few months, building up her professional capabilities before joining TotalEnergies initially as a GIS intern in 2021.
“The working environment here is great, being the only girl is not something I’m intimidated by. I believe, when you find your purpose in a team, you won’t let others diminish your value according to your gender; you know that your contribution matters,” she shares confidently.
She notes that her goals have changed since transitioning from an intern to GIS officer, as it is no longer just about job experience, she seeks to learn and contribute to her colleagues in any way that she can.
“I challenge myself on a daily or weekly basis, asking myself what I learn from this opportunity, in a company like this, with what is being offered to me at this point. How do I contribute in small ways, because over time, one person’s small contribution is going to leave a big impact,” she says.
“I have learnt so much, especially from the people I work with. This company has offered me opportunities, which I may have never been exposed to elsewhere, so I am and will always be grateful to TotalEnergies, because I get to take this knowledge with me,” she adds.
She views her role as a Sunday school teacher of over five years to children between the ages of 10 and 11 as a beautiful way of serving her community.
“It is also a challenging job because you’re not only a teacher to them, but you also become a role model, teaching them about life. I have to keep that in mind and try to apply it in all aspects of my life, even at work,” she says.
She advises that it’s okay not to have everything figured out at first or all at once, and to be pressured by external opinions, but that one should take time to sit with themselves and reflect on what’s really important in life to them.
“Do not take for granted the opportunities available to you, it will lead to what is meant for you. Take full advantage of all the opportunities, make use of everything, learn, grow, develop and be kind to everyone because you don’t know what they’re going through,” she says.
“God first in everything. Pray for it, pray through it and pray at it! Phil 4:13, I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength,” she affirms."
Rabaul private sector concerned,7/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3484,,Business,Fear,Micheal Marum,"The business community of Rabaul Town has expressed deep concerns over the escalating law and order issues that have recently plagued both the town and the wider province.
During a Rabaul Business Community meeting held on Tuesday, March 4th, at the Rabaul Hotel, business owners, together with provincial and district leaders, discussed ways to effectively address the issues.
Present at the meeting to receive the concerns and suggestions of the business houses was the East New Britain Provincial Member, Micheal Marum, acting Rabaul District Administrator, Freddy Lemeki, and Town Mayor, Changol Manuai. Also present was the ENB Senior Provincial Magistrate, Samuel Lavutul.
Rabaul Hotel owner, Susan McGrade, who hosted the meeting, said the business houses in Rabaul employ around five thousand to six thousand employees. She further said though they are assisting in terms of employment, their businesses and employees are also at risk.
Also speaking at the meeting was chairman of the Chinese community in Rabaul and representative of the Hongland Group of Companies, Tom Tong, who also voiced similar concerns.
“As an employer, we are struggling to keep our staff or have stable employees. Most of our workers leave out of fear. Though we provide good security, we are still at risk as we can only do so much,” Tong outlined.
Meantime, acting Rabaul District Administrator, Freddy Lemeki, said they are working with the provincial administration, provincial government, police, magisterial services, Correctional Services, churches and relevant stakeholders to address law and order issues.
Lemeki said a police reservist training is scheduled for the month of April, and added that this would assist in beefing up manpower, which is a major challenge for police in the province.
He said from this program, the reservists can be deployed to hotspots and do footbeats.
Lemeki also announced that an eviction exercise is planned for the coming months to evict illegal settlers in Rabaul Town."
ADF/PNGDF improving interoperability through soldier training,7/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3483,,Security,Trust,Billy Joseph,"Australia and Papua New Guinea have longstanding defence ties that see them regularly work and train together. An Australian Defence Force Mobile Training Team (MTT) is at Taurama Barracks, Port Moresby, where the PNGDF and ADF soldiers are developing their ability to work side by side.
Over the next three months, the ADF MTT will be supporting the PNGDF with foundational training to qualify new soldiers, sailors and aviators.
Yesterday (06 March 20250, PNGDF’s First Royal Pacific Island Regiment (1RPIR) and members of the ADF’s Third Battalion Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR) welcomed a visit from Australian Army Commander 1 Division, Major General Ash Collingburn to Taurama Barracks to observe a joint training activity and see first-hand how the two defence forces are working to build their cooperation skills.
Australian Army Commander 1 Division, Major General Ash Collingburn (second from left) speaking with 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) members and members from PNGDF 1 Royal Pacific Island Regiment (1RPIR) during his visit to Taurama Barracks.
Major General Collingburn commenting on this visit said, “It’s wonderful to be back here in this beautiful country (PNG). I was last here in the middle of last year (2024) so its great to be back to visit our training team here.”
Underscoring the purpose of his visit, he said, “I command Australia’s 1st division so the training teams that we send over here are from my division.
“The training that’s occurring here today is foundation soldier training. So, what you’ll see is a section attack occurring out on the grass but really what our people are doing is enhancing the capability within the PNGDF and improving interoperability within our two forces.
“That’s the real focus.”
The Major General highlighted that ADF historically sends out three training teams every year. The ADF MTT that are facilitating the current training are the first team for the year. Each training duration is three months.
“We’ll send three training teams out throughout the course of this year. Our focus for this first Mobile Training Team will be very much on officer training and then as we progress throughout the year we’ll do more advanced training, including advanced combined arms training.”
Major General Collingburn used the opportunity to highlight Australia and PNG’s close and enduring defence partnership.
“It’s a natural partnership across the Australian Defence Force and the Papua New Guinean Defence Force – we have a shared history, we share a maritime border, we have shared customs and traditions, and we have really strong people-to-people links,” said Major General Collingburn.
MTT2: 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) members and members from PNGDF 1 Royal Pacific Island Regiment (1RPIR) conducting a de-brief during the joint training exercise.
He further highlighted the recent announcement made by Defence Minister Dr Billy Joseph and Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles on the shared commitment to negotiate a bilateral defence treaty, stating that this direction will take the partnership from interoperability to full integration that is based on strategic trust.
Inferring to the strategic trust between the two forces, he said, “Right now, within my third brigade in Townsville, the deputy commander of the third brigade is a Papua New Guinea Defence Force Officer, Colonel Bonnie Aruma. And I think that’s a very powerful demonstration of that strategic trust. We have a deputy commander of a fighting brigade who is a PNGDF officer.
He added, “Just yesterday I met with the CDF (Rear Admiral Philip Polewara) here and his Chief of Staff (Lieutenant Colonel Raphael Yapu), a classmate of mine from the Royal Military College Dunton, so it’s hard to imagine two closer defence forces working together.”
The demonstration between the ADF and PNGDF at Taurama Barracks presented a unique opportunity to witness how the capability and interoperability of the two defence forces has grown, and a demonstration of the strength of the defence partnership between the PNGDF and the ADF that has endured for more than 50 years.

Meantime, Major General Collingburn emphasized the significant efforts of the Australian Defence Force to ensuring full participation in its force from its citizens regardless of gender.
“We have a real focus on diversity across our army and across my division. The battalion that’s here at the moment, the first mobile training team is an armored infantry battalion and we have women serving in that armored infantry battalion so that’s a really good demonstration I think that there are no barriers for women serving in the Australian Defence Force.
“It’s a real focus for us to ensure that we have a really good diversity across the workforce,” said Major General Collingburn."
DPLGA to station officers in provinces,7/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3491,,Government,Trust,Nill,"The Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs (DPLGA) is working on a new structure to strengthen the social contract between the State and the people through the sub-national governments.
Secretary Philip Leo said an officer each will be reassigned from the headquarter to 20 provinces throughout the country under this new structure, once complete.
“These officers will be on the ground providing technical support and ensuring that systems are functioning as intended.
“Their responsibilities will include monitoring the regularity of LLG and provincial meetings and ensuring that leaders and public servants fulfil their obligations.
“Provincial governments, district development authorities and their business arms are reminded that they are legally required to report through the established channels.
“Transparent reporting and adherence to legal requirements are important to effectively deliver essential services to our people.
“My department will be closely monitoring compliance to ensure these requirements are met,” he said.
DPLGA is taking this approach to ensure the leaders and senior public servants at the subnational government level comply with section 187A of the Constitution, the Organic Law on the Provincial and Local Level Governments, District Development Authority Act, the City Authority Act and the Local Level Government Act that forms the framework of the sub-national governments.
Secretary Leo emphasized these changes when he convened the first meeting for Maip-Mulitaka LLG in Enga Province on February 27, 2025.
The Secretary expressed dissatisfaction that this was the first meeting conveyed following the 2019 – 2020 LLG elections, following reports and complaints from across the country of ‘substantial gap in governance and representation’ at the sub-national government level between the people and the State.
He said the failure of the Maip-Mulitaka LLG to conduct its regular meetings since then is a case in point of ‘systemic issue’ across the country that holds people at bay from the State.
He said it was equally disappointing to observe from these reports about the frequent absence of leaders and public servants from their designated locations.
“This prolonged neglect by the leaders of the third-tier governments, who are constitutionally entrusted with legislative duties, is an issue that can no longer be ignored,” he said.
He pointed out that sections 53-55 of the OLPLLG nullified by the Supreme Court does not impact on their mandate to hold all levels of governments accountable for their actions.
“They must operate within their legal framework.
“The Constitution and the enabling legislations are in place to promote good governance and we will ensure their proper implementation,” Secretary Leo stressed.
Meanwhile, he revealed that the department is reviewing provincial governments and LLG assemblies’ Standing Orders to further strengthen the governance mechanism.
He said this review aims at enhancing clarity and enforceability to ensure the sub-national governments function effectively in serving the people.
Stressing on the crucial role of the leaders and the public servants at the sub-national level in the welfare and development of the communities, the DPLGA secretary challenged them to step up to their responsibilities come the country’s 50th Independence Anniversary on September 16, 2025 and in the years to come."
Fatal Pindiu accident claims three,7/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3493,,Local,Sadness,Nill,"A fatal vehicle accident at Pindiu, in Morobe’s Finschhafen district, has claimed three lives while 14 passengers have been admitted to the hospital.
The accident occurred when a hired open-back dark blue Landcruiser was transporting 17 passengers and food to a ‘haus krai’ in Onsesu village, in the Hube Local Level Government, on Wednesday, March 5th.
The vehicle already had 14 passengers – some who had travelled from Lae – when it left Gagidu at 2pm. At Yanzung village, three more passengers got on with garden food for the haus krai.
Gagidu Rural Police Station Commander, Inspector Dominic Livar, reported that the vehicle was traveling down a steep slope towards Mugi Bridge. As they approached the Garenggareng sharp turn, the driver applied the brake but the vehicle did not respond.
Instead, it started gaining momentum and drove over the edge.
“The vehicle tipped over, throwing off all its passengers.”
Due to the sheer drop – considering Pindiu is one of the mountainous areas of Finschhafen – a female nursing officer at the Braun Memorial District Hospital, a 13-year-old Grade 4 student and his mother reportedly died on impact.
Fourteen other passengers were taken to Braun with severe injuries, while the driver had escaped, with Inspector Livar saying he will be picked up for questioning.
The Finschhafen police station commander has recommended that a traffic officer from the Morobe Provincial Police Headquarters be involved in the investigation. He said the accident has revealed that the vehicle has no ownership documentation, no registration and insurance, roadworthiness is questionable and no safety documents."
DPM called to take back PEA appointment powers,6/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3476,,Education,Frustration,Nill,"The Papua New Guinea Teachers Association has called on the Department of Personnel Management to take back the power to appoint Provincial Education Advisors, a power they previously held.
PNGTA National President, Aita Sanangkepe said the appointment of these advisors was decentralized to the provincial level, leading to many appointments not made on merit.
According to Sanangkepe, the primary role of an Education Advisor is to fully manage the education of each province. They look at the appointment of teachers, teachers' leave fares, teachers' retirement issues, and other issues affecting teachers.
However, these issues seem to have increased in the recent past, indicating that the authority that is responsible for dealing with these issues is not doing its job.
That is why PGTA is now calling of the Department of Personnel management to take back the power to  appoint Provincial Education.
He said the association’s primary concern is the welfare of teachers, as quality education can only be achieved through the dedication and support of exemplary educators. Teachers' concerns must be addressed appropriately by the Provincial Education Boards and Education Advisors
The president urged the government to address these urgent matters to ensure a better quality of education for all Papua New Guineans."
A farmer’s quest to address malnutrition,6/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3471,,Health,Trust,Nill,"A poultry farmer in Kutubu is breeding egg-layer chickens as an alternate source of protein for the people there with the goal to improve nutrition and contribute to minimizing malnutrition in the district.
Alphonse Pani of Hedenia village in Kutubu, Southern Highlands Province tapped into this project  in his remote community after seeing the high prevalence of child malnutrition due to lack of balanced diets in a family unit everyday. He is hoping the production of eggs in the community can assist in addressing this issue as it can be accessed easily and at affordable prices as eggs are a good source of protein.
Alphonse started his chicken layer program in December last year, starting with 500 chickens. The chickens should be able to start laying at 17 weeks.
Alphonse plans to expand this project to include more chickens but has been faced with funding challenges. He explained his challenges on Monday saying raising chicken layers is expensive compared to broilers, highlighting the high cost of the chicks, the chicken feed, the time it takes for the chickens to mature and start laying eggs, and labour.
""Raising egg-layers is a different game. A box of 52 egg layer chicks from Niugini Tablebirds in Lae cost K1000. I arranged transport to bring the young chicks home to Kutubu safe by road,"" he said.
He bought a total of ten boxes of chicks for K10,000 and a total of 40 stock feed bags These stock feed bags comprise 15 bags of layer starter, 11 bags of grower and 14 bags of layer finisher.
But despite this cost, Alphonse says during the egg production phase, each chicken should be able to lay at least one egg per day. His target is to have 500 eggs per day by 500 chickens so in one week, he is looking to sell 3500 eggs and about 14,000 eggs in a month.
Alphonse is raising his chickens in a temporary shelter made of bush materials and intends to construct a permanent structure, but again funding remains a constraint. This project has cost him almost K20,000. He sourced this money from a small trade store he owns. Alphonse’s aim is to improve nutrition and create income earning opportunities for locals through the reselling of eggs."
Late Constable Biape’s family aggrieved,6/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3479,,Law,Anger,Nill,"The family members of the late Constable Noah Biape are disappointed that they were not involved in the recent petition presentation hosted by the Police hierarchy and the members of Southern Highlands and Eastern Highlands on Tuesday, March 4th.
The grieving family, along with relatives, have been mourning in silence for seven weeks. They are now demanding an explanation for the perceived disregard shown by these leaders.
The family is particularly upset that their petition was not received alongside the one presented on Tuesday, which was the petition of late Constable Harry Gorano. They feel this sensitive issue was not handled with the respect and consideration it deserved.
Noah’s late father, who is the Koroba Kopiago Police Station Commander Sergeant Henry Biape described the situation as a significant insult to his son.
Sergeant Biape has dedicated 37 years of service to the police force. Combined with his late son's 10 years of service, the family has contributed an impressive 47 years to law enforcement. They believe this treatment is unworthy of their sacrifices and commitment.
Sgt. Henry Biape had previously called for peace and calm following the tragic incident, showing respect for the work of the police. However, the events of Tuesday, when the SHP, Eastern Highlands leaders, and police hierarchy met to receive the petition from the Eastern Highlands family, have deeply hurt the Biape family. They were not approached or consulted by the relevant leaders and authorities, which they see as a failure to address their grievances and concerns.
The family of the late Constable Noah Biape is now demanding answers from the SHP leaders, the Police Minister, and the Police Commissioner. They want to know why they were excluded from the joint media conference and petition presentation."
NIP Assembly to elect caretaker governor,6/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3469,,Politics,Anticipation,"Julius Chan, Sir Julius Chan","With the passing of the late Governor of New Ireland Province, Sir Julius Chan, the main question now is, who will be the next Governor?
Upon Sir J’s passing, his Deputy, Sammy Missen, automatically took over as caretaker governor.
Pending a by-election date, yet to be set by the PNG Electoral Commission, the Provincial
Assembly will sit on the 26th of March and go ahead with the Election of an acting governor.
Per the advice from the secretary of the Department of Provincial & Local Level Government Affairs, Philip Leo, upon the passing of the late Provincial Governor, there is now effectively a vacancy in the seat of the provincial governor. This is pursuant to section 19(1)(e) of the Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments (OLPGLLG).

However, section 19(1) (b) clarifies that if a member of Parliament is holding a Ministry, they are automatically disqualified from being eligible to be elected as Provincial Governor. In the event that they wish to be eligible to be elected, they will have to resign from their ministerial portfolios.
“If both of the Open MPs resign in time for the intended date to elect a Provincial Governor
on the floor of the Assembly, which is 26th March 2025, there will have to be an election, in accordance with the New Ireland Provincial Standing Orders,” clarified secretary Leo.
“If only one of the Open MPs resigns to become eligible for the Governor’s post, that Open
MP will have to be seconded and the Deputy Chairman will declare him as the Provincial
Governor.”
Secretary Leo also advised that should the Deputy Governor wish to be eligible to be elected as the Provincial Governor on the floor of the Assembly, he will have to tender his resignation to the Minister.
An assistant Chairman will have to be appointed by the Assembly from amongst the members of the Assembly, to perform the duties of chairman during the Assembly sitting that elects the Provincial Governor.
The clerk of the New Ireland Legislative Assembly, Ao Ure, confirmed that voting will be carried out through an open ballot."

Beon escapee surrenders to police,6/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3465,,Law,Trust,Nill,"After nearly a year on the run, Jeremiah George, also known as ‘Maia’, a prison escapee from Beon Correctional Institution, has voluntarily surrendered to police in Madang province. This significant development was confirmed by Acting Superintendent Robert Baim, the Madang Provincial Police Commander.
George turned himself in on Monday, March 03rd at 11:00am at Old Jant Compound, located in ward 08 of the Madang Local Level Government. His surrender was made possible through the concerted efforts of his family members and local community leaders, highlighting the crucial role of community cooperation in law enforcement.
The decision to surrender came after George narrowly escaped a life-threatening situation, which prompted him to reach out through the Transnational Crimes Unit and the National Criminal Intelligence Unit.
George was one of three inmates who escaped from Beon Prison on April 04th, 2020. At the time, he was in custody facing charges for the alleged willful murder of David Sole in 2019, a case that drew significant public attention.
The other two escapees involved in the breakout included Issack Jack, alias ‘Iceman’, who was killed shot and died, and Gerard Manase, alias ‘Comens’, who is still at large. The trio have been linked to various criminal activities across the provinces of Madang and East Sepik. These activities have been under investigation, with some cases already reported, underscoring the ongoing challenges faced by law enforcement in the region.
Acting Superintendent Baim has called on the public to remain vigilant and to report any sightings of Manase, emphasizing the importance of community involvement in ensuring safety and security.
“Police will track down the remaining escapee. We encourage the community to cooperate and provide any information that may lead to his capture,” Baim stated.
He also appealed to any individuals still evading the law to surrender, particularly as the country approaches its 50th Independence Anniversary, a time for reflection and unity.
Jeremiah George, originally from Somudo village in the Angoram District of East Sepik, and Manam Island in the Bogia district of Madang, is married and a father of three.
Police investigations into the activities of the escapees continue, with authorities keen on resolving outstanding cases to bring justice and closure to affected communities and individuals."

Police welfare issues under investigation,6/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3461,,Security,Sadness,Nill,"The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary is conducting an administrative investigation into the way police officers are being protected while on duty.
Police Commissioner David Manning said this when addressing the recent death of two police officers in Mendi, Southern Highlands Province recently.
Manning said the administration investigation will coincide with the criminal investigation that is on foot, to establish the facts that led to the death of the police officers.
“The administrative investigation will look at how we can do better in protecting our members and we are hoping that the result of this investigation will recommend to the executives on how we can best protect our members, and how we can tweak our Standard Operating Procedures to ensure the occurrence of this happening again in the future is minimized.
“I do note the concerns of the grieving families about the lack of support or responsive healthcare, that is also being taken onboard, and it will be part of the administrative investigation,” Manning said.
“I reassure the immediate families of the two constables that through our police legacy, we will continue to support the families, we will continue to provide for their children’s education, and we will do the honorable thing to put them to rest,” he said.
Meanwhile, Manning also raised concerns regarding the politicization of their death.
“Politicize whatever you want, but do not chip into the death of my policemen by propagating false information through social media, and by using this as a political gimmick because lives are not gimmick and be mindful that the police force values lives of its members,” Manning said.
Police Minister Peter Tisamalili Jnr shared similar sentiments. “The other political leaders who maybe on the opposite, do not use this opportunity to sensationalize an insight. Allow ordinary Papua New Guineans to voice their concerns through social media or newspapers. Your space is on the floor of Parliament. If you want to criticize the government, say it on the floor of Parliament. That is the most appropriate space and time for you to share your grievances or your concerns over the government,” Tsiamalili added."
Niningi satisfied with court's decision,6/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3463,,Politics,Trust,"James Nomane, Pila Niningi","The Minister for Justice and Attorney General Pila Niningi has applauded the Supreme Court in upholding the doctrine of Separation of Powers as enshrined under section 99 of the Constitution.
The Constitution has vested powers and responsibilities in the National Parliament, the National Executive Council, and the National Judicial System.
“In so far as such bodies are created independence of direction and control, they would be seen to be exercising the power of the people given to them as a direct grant by the Constitution.
“The Supreme Court, in its wisdom, has considered that it does not warrant an incursion by the Court upon the lawmaking power of the Parliament and confirmed that the Court's function remains one of construction.
“This shows that we have a robust and vibrant Judicial System and a healthy democracy in Papua New Guinea,” Niningi said.
The Attorney General made this statement after the five men bench of the Supreme Court refused Deputy Opposition leader James Nomane's application to restrain Parliament from dealing with a proposal amendment to Section 145 of the Constitution when Parliament resumes on March 11th, 2025.
Nomane filed an application in the Supreme Court under section 81 (1) of the Constitution. He was seeking declarations and orders regarding a notice of motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister dated November 27th 2024, which was not placed on the notice paper of the Parliament due to section 165 of the standing order.
Section 165 of the Standing Orders is about the renewal of motions.
While the trial of his application is pending, he moved an application for an interim order to restrain the Parliament from dealing with any manner or form of a proposed constitutional amendment entitled Constitutional Amendment (Motion of No Confidence Law) 2024 regarding a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister.
Nomane, through the application, claimed that if no such order is made, there is a risk that the Parliament will amend the Constitution.
He argued that if that amendment is made, his substantive application will become futile.
However, the Supreme Court refused his application on the grounds that the application lacked jurisdiction and to the extent that there is jurisdiction, it has not been enlivened.
Niningi on the other end, clarified that the proposed amendment to S145 of the Constitution intends to protect the way leadership is governed and gives confidence to the conduct of leadership in the country.
“That bill is intended to protect and give confidence to the people. Every time a Parliament is sitting, the Parliament deliberates on VONC. When we continue to do that, we do not achieve anything. We must give confidence to our people and ensure that investors confidence must be maintained.
“The law simply deliberated that once you lose the VONC, incumbent government will take an 18-month grace period. That’s the bill that is before the Parliament.
“The bill does not deprive the right of members of Parliament to vote and change the government; rather it outlines responsibility, stability and good governance,” Niningi added."
Igam Barracks Chapel upgraded,6/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3462,,Military,Trust,Nill,"Igam Barracks in Lae, Morobe Province, proudly opened its newly-upgraded chapel on Tuesday, March 4th.
The construction of Igam Barracks started in 1960 with the intention of developing the Pacific Islands Regiment (PIR).
The Australian government’s plan in the early 1960s was to have three battalions and three new barracks. The barracks are Taurama in Port Moresby, Moem in East Sepik Province and Igam in Lae.
While three barracks were built, only two battalions were raised due to funding constraints at that time.
Deputy Chief of Defence, Brigadier General Larry Opa, said the chapel was also built to cater for the pastoral needs of troops from both the Australian armed forces and the Papua and New Guinea Voluntary Rifles.
“This place was meant to be the future home of the 3rd Royal Pacific Islands Regiment but circumstances took another direction, and now it has become the home of the engineer battalion,” he outlined.
“Over the years, the Joint Forces College was also co-hosted here, including the air transport wing, which eventually moved to Port Moresby.
“So, this building that we’re standing in front of, on this occasion of its reopening, after almost 60 years. Although it has gone through various renovations, this one has more significance as it is occuring on the 50th anniversary of our independence.”
Brigadier General Opa acknowledged the presence of the Director General Pacific Division of the Australian Defence Force, Air Commodore Jo Brick. He appreciated her for making time to travel from Canberra, underlining that this speaks to the long history between the two forces.
In response, Air Commodore Brick said, “A lot of these engagements highlight the importance and depth of our relationship, as Brigadier Opa mentioned.
“Our relationship is deep and incredibly strong so it’s a great honour to be able to open this chapel, which is both an important place of worship and the observance of spirituality, but also a place for our communities and our nations to be together.”
The chapel refurbishment started in August 2024 and ended in December. Aside from the chapel, a new multi-purpose facility was also constructed."
Halt Connect PNG Program: Governor Peter,5/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3446,,Politics,Fear,Rufina Peter,"Governor for Central Provincial, Rufina Peter has made a call to immediately suspend the Connect PNG Program for the next 50 years, until proper border security mechanisms are put in place.
In a media statement made today, Governor Peter issued an immediate call to halt connect PNG Program to protect the Papuan region from the escalating security threats. Without proper security measures in place, the program is deemed to be a national security threat to the Papuan region.

Governor Peter has proposed a number of immediate security measures which includes security posts at provincial borders to monitor movement of people and the immediate halt to the Connect PNG program expansion into the Papua region through Central, Gulf and the nation’s capital, and.
Her concerns stem from the recent spate of violence across the country, especially in provinces that share a common border with the Central Province. She is now calling for backing from other members of parliament representing Papua New Guineans in the Papua region."
PNG benefits from ADF sports program,5/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3447,,Sports,Trust,Nill,"The Papua New Guinea sporting community is benefiting from enhanced accreditation and development opportunities through the Australian Defence Force (ADF) International Sports Program. This initiative, conducted in partnership with several key organizations including the National Rugby League (NRL) Australian Football League (AFL) Sports Medicine Australia, and the Federation of International Touch Football, aims to deliver comprehensive training programs for coaches, referees, and sports trainers.
The program offers a range of educational and practical training opportunities, including:
- Level 1 Coaching Certification
- Referee Training
- Sports Trainer Certification
- First Aid Training
- Healthy Lifestyle Education
- Strength and Conditioning Programs
All these initiatives are facilitated by ADF personnel and internationally accredited sports experts.
Yesterday (04 March 2025), over 30 participants, comprising community-based coaches, trainers, and referees from rugby league and touch rugby, gathered at the Sir John Guise Stadium. The day's activities transitioned from classroom theory to practical outdoor drills, covering fundamental skills such as passing, attacking, and defensive techniques.
ADF Warrant Naval Officer, Head Coach and lead facilitator, Shane Bullock, alongside Nigel Hukula, PNGRFL Community Rugby League Development Officer, oversaw the rugby league drills. Their focus was on hands-on training that emphasized the fundamentals of the game, which they believe is critical for grassroots development.
Bullock expressed his admiration for the skill levels displayed by some of the participants, noting a keen eagerness to learn among coaches of all levels.
“To me, it shows that everyone is so keen to get in and learn more in PNG, which is really good. The skill level is actually really good with a lot of these coaches, varying from senior teams down to junior kids. The grassroots is the important part, and the participation has been really good so far.”
He further highlighted the importance of having a structured training plan. He emphasized that coaches should approach their training with a clear plan to ensure consistency and to foster a shared understanding among participants.
Bullock’s vision for coaching extends beyond mere technical instruction; he believes it encompasses instilling values such as respect-for oneself, fellow players, officials, and the community. He encourages coaches to focus on personal development alongside athletic performance:
“I think it’s big for them to learn that coaching is just about teaching everyone to play rugby league. It’s about teaching them values of respect-respect for themselves, for players, for officials and coaches, and for their community. This way, they can return to their communities not just as better football players but as better people.”
The collaboration between the ADF and PNG sporting organizations is paving the way for a stronger, more skilled community of coaches and athletes. With ongoing training and development opportunities, this partnership aims to uplift the quality of sport."
Misleading social media posts fueling problems,5/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3457,,Society,Fear,William Powi,"Concerns have been raised about the adverse effects of unverified information that’s being circulated on social media platforms, exacerbating problems, and causing panic, fear and disorder in the community.
These concerns were raised following the recent activities in the Eastern Highlands Province by the relatives of two deceased police officers in an attempt to gain the attention of the authorities.
Police said many of the information that were circulated on social media were unverified, leading to the public being misled about the situation.
The political leaders of Southern Highlands, Eastern Highlands, and the police hierarchy condemned the disrespectful approach by citizens who published and spread misinformation on social media without getting their facts right.
They said social media users were publishing unverified information, causing fear and anxiety, leading to social disorder and chaos in the country.
Minister for Police Peter Tsiamalili Jnr said this can have devastating effects.
“To the many social media users, we will not entertain fake information in our country. No more fake misinformation about roadblocks in the highlands highway, no more fake information about compensation, get your facts right before posting information,” he said.
In sharing similar sentiments, Southern Highlands Governor William Powi said if Papua New Guineans are not mindful of what they post on social media, it can break the fabric of Papua New Guinea’s law and law enforcement in the country.
“Social media is causing a lot of harm and destruction for the governance and the good reputation of this country in terms of the law and justice sector.
“Sending fake information from one end to another and creating social disharmony can undermine the institutions of governance.
“Therefore, Papua New Guineans must understand that law and order is not the responsibility of police but it is a shared responsibility by the community as well,” Powi added.
Tsiamalili said that despite the negativity on social media, the government is working to ensure there is peace and that disputes are dealt with following the right processes of law."

"“There is no excuse”, says Unitech registrar",5/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3449,,Education,Fear,Nill,"The arrest of students at the Papua New Guinea University of Technology by police in Lae, should serve as a warning to the rest of the students.
Fourteen male students were arrested and charged for being ‘drunk and disorderly’ at the main Unitech gate on Saturday, March 01st, at 3am.
They made headlines when they were charged K4,000 each, or serve two years in prison, by District Court magistrate, Nasiling Bingtau.
Unitech Registrar, Veronica Thomas, said the Council and Senior Executive Management Team does not condone the behaviour of the 14 students.
She underlined the university’s ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy; a message that was relayed to students during the two weeks of orientation and registration.
Additionally, a large billboard with a similar message is displayed right in front of the gate.
“We have strict rules that we apply here on campus; however, if students are caught outside the university's fence, drinking, fighting, or breaking the law in general, the police will deal with them. We will not interfere with the process or come to their rescue – the law applies,” emphasised the registrar.
“There is no excuse for their actions.
“What these students have demonstrated at the beginning of the 2025 academic year is a complete disregard for their education and the efforts of their parents, guardians, and sponsors.”
Mrs. Thomas stated that university management and staff are making strides to improve the quality of education and systems, with the recent accreditation of engineering programs and ongoing benchmarking of non-engineering courses. This behaviour contradicts what the university has been striving to achieve.
“The majority of the students are serious about their education, but there are also irresponsible students whose behaviour tarnishes the university's image.”
She noted that the institution has academic policies in place that will determine the fate of these students’ education following the court case and the number of days they have missed class.
“If the zero-tolerance policy is breached on campus, rules for suspension will automatically apply. Penalty ranges from one to three years of suspension maximum,” she stated.
Thomas added that this will serve as a lesson to all university students throughout the rest of the year;  they are not immune to the laws, and they must behave as responsible citizens."
PNG’s security relationships built on trust,5/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3451,,Politics,Trust,Billy Joseph,"Papua New Guinea has a shared history with Australia and values its friends.
These shared values have shaped the nation in its fifty years of nationhood.
‘Friends to all, Enemies to none’ formed the pathway to foreign relationships, many of which emerged from common land and maritime boundaries and shared values.
Minister for Defence, Dr Billy Joseph in a statement said the relationship developed together between Australia and Papua New Guinea, as close neighbors has provided the impetus to foster common national security interests.
“PNG Defence Force is committed to our long tradition of engaging with our Pacific partners to collectively meet and respond to regional security needs, as articulated in the Biketawa 2000 and Boe 2018 Declarations and as can be seen through multilateral institutions such the South Pacific Defence Ministers’ meeting and the Pacific Islands Forum.”
He said PNG values all of its bilateral relationships and partnerships, including the support received from its international defence cooperation through various bilateral and multilateral engagements.
PNGDF’s cooperation and engagement with international partners is conducted according to PNG’s foreign policy settings and principles for engagement.
This cooperation and engagement is crucial as it strengthens Defence's ability to meet its mandated tasks and provides an avenue for Defence to enhance its understanding of the regional and international security environments.
PNGDF has strong established relationships with its key partners, which include but are not limited to Australia, New Zealand, the U.S. and Indonesia.
“The support PNG has received from Australia, and the U.S on the Lombrum Redevelopment Project, on Manus is unprecedented.
“This facility will enable the PNGDF to conduct maritime operations combating illegal fishing, transitional crime and border protection.
“This enhances the ability of the Force to meet its Constitutional functions to defend PNG and its territory. Our partners understand the importance PNG places on the Treaty of Rarotonga.
“Papua New Guinea must also choose its bilateral relationships based on longstanding historical ties, intertwined security interests, deep interpersonal links, shared democratic values, and mutual interest for a safer and peaceful region.”"
Heavy police presence at Lae settlement,4/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3423,,Local,Fear,Nill,"Nawaeb Block, in Lae, is calm this morning as students and the working class are seen making their way to their respective busstops along Buimo Road.
Two vehicles with police personnel are parked in the middle of the road, with armed officers monitoring the area.
Police presence is heavy there due to a confrontation between a group from Kagua, Southern Highlands Province, and criminal elements at the settlement.
Lae metropolitan superintendent, Chris Kunyanban, said this follows an incident last weekend when a taxi belonging to a Kagua man was reportedly held up at Nawaeb Block.
The taxi driver allegedly retaliated and seriously injured one of the suspects.
“The suspect was rescued by his associates from the Angau hospital last week and they gathered in numbers and demanded compensation from the Kaguas on Sunday, and again yesterday (March 3) morning,” said Kunyanban.
“During that time, one Pangia and a Kagua received pellet wounds after the compensation meeting failed.”
Situation was tense yesterday morning with a large crowd gathering around a burning house.
Police intervened, with the situation looking to be under control, until a surpise attack was launched in the afternoon against the SHP group, resulting in several of their houses being burnt down.
Police responded and chased the criminal elements and their sympathisers up the hills behind Birdwing Homes, at Buimo Road.
Kunyanban said police presence will be maintained at the location. However, he is urging residents to take precautions when traveling that way.
“Some of the criminals might be injured,” he continued.
“Any reports or sightings of injured people, please inform police as soon as possible.”"

"Ijivitari DDA, SILAG partner in training",4/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3444,,Development,Trust,David Arore,"The Ijivitari District Development Authority (DDA) in Northern province has launched a partnership with the Somare Institute of Leadership and Governance (SILAG) with a K140, 000 cheque presented to the institution this week.
The district is the first in the country to partner with SILAG to expedite funds to train its public servants and school leavers, according to SILGAG’s Chief executive officer, Michael Barobe.
Local MP and Vice Minister for Finance, David Arore, when handing over the cheque on Monday said, he was humbled to honor the DDA’s commitment made last year to partner with the SILAG to train its public servants and school leavers to boost its public service delivery mechanism in the district.
‘’We made a commitment last year to come into partnership with SILAG to train our public servants and school leavers who want to pursue careers in the public service and also provide pathways for them.
‘’And I am humbled to say that the commitment is realized today with the first batch of K140, 000 paid today.’’
He stressed that the main reason for the partnership with SILAG was to empower public servants in the area to deliver.
He said, ‘’We have three based LLGs that are rural based and it is within Ijivitari DDA’s interest that we work around the clock to making sure that we have enough trained public servants in our LLGs to move forward the district.”
He said with the training of school leavers in attaining basic public service courses is to empower their skills and knowledge to work in the district and deliver services within the district and LLGs where it is possible.
‘’Thus, I am happy to announce that we are making a pathway to improve public service delivery mechanism in the district through this partnership with SILAG,’’ he added.
Barobe said this initiative empowers the public service delivery mechanism in the district.
‘’Our courses and training programs are all based on government policies, transpiring in districts, provinces and at the national government level.
“We deliver training based on job descriptions. They become competent public servants when they go out from here,” he said.
A further payment of K255, 000 will be made later in the year that accumulates a fixed funding of K355,000 to SILAG for the training."
Expatriates sworn-in as police directors,4/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3442,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"Two expatriates were sworn in as directors in the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC), in Port Moresby today.
Chief Superintendent Rodney Swain will be serving as the Director for the Training wing, and Chief Superintendent Glyn Lewis will be serving as the Executive Director of the National Fraud and Anti-Corruption Directorate. Both were sworn in by Commissioner of Police David Manning. Police Minister Peter Tsiamalili Jnr and other police executives witnessed the occasion.
As part of the PNG-Australian Policing Partnership, Chief Superintendents Swain and Lewis are the first front-line police officers brought into the force as international experts. They join the current 6,700 ranks in the force.
Minister Tsiamalili said, “Rebuilding a professional and modern police force means having police expertise where it is needed and when its needed.
“These officers will be operating under the laws of PNG guided by the conduct of RPNGC. They will work closely with our front-line police, bringing in with them a wealth of experience and expertise.”
Manning said the involvement of these expatriates bridges the gap that has been lacking in terms of international expertise in the force.
“They are sworn into the RPNGC under PNG law, and they will be serving our police force and serving our people,” he said.
Manning thanked the directors for putting their hands up to serve the people of Papua New Guinea. He said their involvement signifies their determination to contribute to the development of the force."
"Peace agreement breached, no compensation",4/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3437,,Politics,Anger,Nill,"Controller of State of Emergency in Porgera, Chief Superintendent Joseph Tondop has ordered that no compensation be paid to the relatives of the men killed on Sunday at the Porgera Mine.
He said this is because there was a breach of an existing peace agreement as stipulated in Clause D of the Emergency Peace Agreement (EPA) about Illegal Mining.
The controller stated that the councilors of Sakar Mamai and Piande clans signed the EPA for and on behalf of their clan members stating that they will not engage in illegal mining activities of any kind or support anyone engaging in this activity.
Tondop further outlined parts of the agreement under this clause where the councilors on behalf of their people accepted and agreed in the EPA that they will not condemn or demand compensation of any kind from any other person or party, whether a party to this agreement or not, if a member of their clan is killed within the open mine pit. They declared that such deaths shall be considered, seen and accepted as ‘FREE DEATH'.
Chief Superintendent Tondop further stated that the open pit is a restricted area with blasts going off at any time. Nobody is permitted anywhere inside the pit unless duly authorised by New Porgera Limited. He said residents of the SML area have been warned numerous times not to enter the pit as it was dangerous.
The incident on Sunday was a result of illegal miners entering the pit with firearms ready to attack other illegal miners over territorial rights within the open pit – land that is State owned and leased to NPL and hence over which they have no rights whatsoever.
“I have directed SOE Investigative Task Force members under the Command of Senior Inspector Mack Anema to investigate events leading to death of IMs (illegal miners) in the pit, destruction of mine equipment, injuries sustained by mine staff as well as IMs, other innocent civilians and sabotaging of public road infrastructure at Yonge village in Laiagam by the Sakar Tribe.
This investigation is necessary to establish the facts surrounding this matter and ascertain criminal culpability by all parties involved including members of the security forces. Where criminal conduct is identified, appropriate actions will be taken. This is necessary to restore credibility in the criminal justice system and respect for the rule of law,” Tondop further stated."
Disaster Resilience Program Launched,4/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3434,,International,Trust,Nill,"Papua New Guinea (PNG) has launched an advanced disaster resilience initiative to improve preparedness and response for vulnerable communities.
The Building Safety and Resilience in the Pacific Phase II (BSRP II) project was officially launched on Monday, March 03, 2025 at the Holiday Inn in Port Moresby, officiated by Secretary for the Department for Community Development and Religion, Jerry Ubase, and Director of the National Disaster Centre, Laso Mana.
Director Mana thanked the South Pacific Community (SPC) and the European Union (EU) for its commitment to strengthening PNG’s resilience to natural hazards, aligning with Mission 2050 and the Medium-Term Development Plan 4 (MTDP4).
“The effectiveness of early warning information relies on the establishment of multifaceted, multilayered, and integrated projects and programs. The BSRP project aims to improve and strengthen this framework.
“By understanding our common natural hazard risks and their implications for human security, we can optimize early warning systems to ensure effective information flow both vertically and horizontally,” said Mr. Mana in his opening remarks.
Secretary Ubase also thanked the support of the SPC and the EU in strengthening PNG’s disaster preparedness, particularly for women, girls, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.
“As the department committed to protecting rights and empowering all aspects of human life, we emphasize ensuring a safety net for women, girls, the elderly, and people with disabilities, particularly in disaster risk reduction efforts.
“To enhance accessibility to essential services, we are establishing District Community Development Centres (DCDC), which will serve as mini-departments at the district level.
“These centres will deliver mandated programs, including Social Impact Assessments on Disaster Impacts, to promote a healthier, safer, and more sustainable environment for all communities,” Ubase said.
Funded by the EU under the 11th European Development Fund, the EUR 14 million project spans 14 Pacific Island nations and Timor-Leste. Given PNG’s vulnerability to seismic activity, extreme weather, and climate-related disasters, this initiative is a crucial step toward sustainable development.
Joining via Zoom, SPC’s Geoscience, Energy, and Maritime Division Director, Rhonda Robinson, described the launch as a significant milestone in building resilient Pacific communities. She emphasized the importance of strengthening early warning systems, improving infrastructure, and ensuring inclusive disaster planning.
The project’s National Steering Committee in PNG includes representatives from the National Disaster Centre, National Weather Service, Port Moresby Geophysical Observatory, Department of Community Development and Religion, and Department of Education."

PNG expands visa-on-arrival to more countries,4/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3440,,Business,Trust,John Rosso,"Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, has officially announced the addition of three countries to the existing visa-on-arrival (VOA) eligible country list.
“Passport holders from the United Kingdom (UK), Canada, and Singapore, are now eligible to get visa-on-arrival in Papua New Guinea,” Rosso said.
Rosso, who is also responsible for the Immigration and Border Security Ministry, said that effective immediately, passport holders from the UK, Canada, and Singapore, travelling on ordinary and official passports can get visa-on-arrival for short-stays of up to 60 days.
The VOA facility is only available at the Jackson’s International Airport in Port Moresby for all eligible countries.
“The VOA will be granted to those who travel for leisure, holiday, tourism, and visiting families and friends for short-stay purposes only. Those who travel for employment and long-stay visas must apply online before they travel,” he said.
“Passport holders from these three countries are also eligible for a business short-term single-entry visa-on-arrival. All conditions under the short-term business visa apply, including the Migration Service Fee of US$ 190 Dollars.”
Rosso said the government is reciprocating VOA with countries who offer the same to Papua New Guinea nationals. These arrangements are based on strategic assessments and risks factors.
The inclusion of the UK, Canada, and Singapore, now adds to the list of countries who are eligible for VOA in PNG. Other countries include Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, New Caledonia, American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau, the United States territories of Guam and Northern Mariana Islands, and the French territories of French Polynesia (Tahiti) and Wallis and Futuna.
Chief Migration Officer of Papua New Guinea, Wellington Navasivu, said that countries with existing VOA arrangements under bilateral agreements for stays up to 60 days, include Israel for all passport holders, and Japan, China, and Indonesia for official, service, and diplomatic passports.
Holders of Indonesian official and diplomatic passports can also enter through the Wutung Border Post under the conditions of the existing bilateral arrangement.
“ICSA and the Department of Foreign Affairs are negotiating VOA arrangements with other countries which Papua New Guinea shares common interests with,” Navasivu said.
Rosso said the new VOA arrangements will create more opportunities in tourism, business, and trade."
Partnership forged to address littering,4/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3430,,Community,Trust,Nill,"The Madang Provincial Government and PNG Fire Service have partnered to keep the Madang township clean by installing rubbish drums.
On Sunday (March 2nd) 20 rubbish drums were installed in town, at bus stops, shopping centres and the town market parameters to ensure people who congregated there dispose of their rubbish appropriately.
Seemingly, over the years, piles of rubbish have been heaped in certain areas within town becoming an eyesore for the general public.
Madang governor, Ramsy Pariwa said the town has gone filthy and the proper authorities who are supposed to ensure cleanliness within have not performed, prompting the provincial government to take up this initiative.
Pariwa has made an open call to the people of Madang to join him in a clean-up exercise on Saturday (8th March). He said the general public has to take ownership of the town and ensure that no one is unnecessarily littering.
Governor Pariwa stressed to the people that they should not rely on the government all the time and that town cleanliness is everybody’s business.
Provincial Fire Services Commander, Superintendent Albert Uramani said apart from emergency responses, they also have a duty towards community obligations, and are happy to be part of the community clean-up.
Commander Uramani is calling on other government sectors and business houses to follow suit and join in the cleanathon."
How Mt Wilhem's frogs are vulnerable to climate peril,4/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3429,,Science,Anticipation,Nill,"As dusk descends upon the misty slopes of Papua New Guinea's Mt. Wilhelm, a solitary chirp pierces the silence, soon joined by a multitude of tiny voices, swelling into a vibrant nocturnal chorus.
These harmonious calls emanate from the mountain's diverse and often-overlooked frog populations, residing in an extraordinary home high among the clouds.
A recent study led by Dr. Chris Dahl and a team of researchers has revealed that the diversity of frog species along Mt. Wilhelm-Papua New Guinea’s tallest peak-follows a striking pattern, one that could redefine our understanding of amphibian biodiversity in tropical mountains.
Their findings, published in the journal ""Biotropica"", show that frog diversity reaches a dramatic peak at mid-elevations, between 1,700 and 2,000 metres above sea level, before tapering off at the highest reaches of the mountain.
What’s more, species turnover-the replacement of one species with another along the gradient-happens at an astonishingly rapid rate, making this remote mountain a natural laboratory for studying evolution, adaptation, and the potential impacts of climate change.
A Rainforest rising into the sky
Mt. Wilhelm, soaring 4,509 metres above sea level, presents a unique natural experiment in species distribution. From the humid, insect-rich lowlands to the windswept, stunted forests near the tree line, the mountain hosts a diverse range of ecological niches.
To uncover the patterns of amphibian diversity, Dahl’s team established eight survey sites, spaced at 500-metre elevation intervals, between the riverine forests at 200 metres and the rugged, moss-covered slopes at 3700 metres.
Over 3,390 individual frogs were recorded across these sites, representing 55 species from five distinct families.
The Microhylidae family, known for its ground-dwelling species with direct-developing eggs (bypassing the tadpole stage), dominated the montane environments, while the lowlands harboured a mix of both aquatic and terrestrial breeders.
The mystery of mid-elevation peaks
The study uncovered an unexpected trend: species richness (the number of different species in a given area) peaked at mid-elevations rather than gradually decreasing with altitude, as might be expected in harsher conditions.
This so-called “mid-elevation diversity bulge” has been observed in other mountain ecosystems, such as the Andes and the Himalayas, but its exact causes remain debated.
Several factors could be at play.
Mid-elevations may provide the ideal balance of temperature, humidity, and food availability, with fewer predators like frog-eating snakes that dominate the lowland forests.
Alternatively, high rates of speciation in montane environments-where populations are often isolated-could be driving the emergence of new species with narrow elevation ranges.
In contrast, the lowlands, though vast and teeming with life, exhibited lower beta diversity, meaning that species compositions remained relatively stable across large distances.
Clues to climate change vulnerability
One of the most concerning findings of the study was the narrow elevational range of most species.
More than half of the frog species observed were confined to a vertical band of less than 500 metres.
This suggests that even minor climatic shifts-such as rising temperatures pushing species upslope-could lead to significant disruptions in frog communities. For species already clinging to the uppermost reaches of their range, there may be nowhere left to go.
Climate change isn’t the only threat.
Although Papua New Guinea’s amphibians have so far remained largely unaffected by the deadly chytrid fungus, which has devastated frog populations in Australia and Central America, researchers warn that the disease’s introduction could have catastrophic effects.
Monitoring efforts like those conducted on Mt. Wilhelm will be crucial in tracking potential threats and developing conservation strategies.
Why mountains matter for global bio diversity
Beyond its implications for frogs, this research unveils the critical role of tropical mountains as biodiversity hotspots.
The study found that species turnover along the elevational gradient was so steep that moving just 500 metres up the mountain led to as much change in community composition as traveling 200 kilometres across New Guinea’s lowland forests.
This highlights the fine-scale ecological partitioning that allows an extraordinary number of species to coexist in such a confined space.
The highlands of New Guinea have long been known for their biological treasures, but studies like this reveal just how delicate these ecosystems are.
As climate change, habitat loss, and disease loom on the horizon, understanding these natural patterns of diversity and adaptation is more important than ever.

He has also been instrumental in developing research infrastructure and training programs in Papua New Guinea, contributing to both scientific knowledge and local capacity building.
Looking into the future
Dahl and his team hope their research will serve as a baseline for future ecological monitoring in Papua New Guinea.
Establishing long-term study sites could provide crucial insights into how mountain species respond to environmental change over time.
For now, the frogs of Mt. Wilhelm continue their nocturnal symphony, hidden in the mists of one of the world’s last great wildernesses. But their survival depends on what we do next.
Did you know?
Papua New Guinea is home to over 400 described species of frogs, with many more yet to be formally named.
• Some highland frog species lay their eggs in damp leaf litter rather than in water, an adaptation that allows them to thrive in cloud forests.
• The chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), which has wiped out amphibian populations worldwide, has not yet been detected on Mt. Wilhelm-but scientists are keeping a close watch.

Academic integrity emphasised,4/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3439,,Education,Trust,Nill,"Academic integrity was emphasised during the orientation of postgraduate students at the PNG University of Technology in Lae, Morobe Province.
With the theme: “Empowering changemakers: Research for a better tomorrow”, Acting Dean of the Faculty of Postgraduate Studies, Research and Innovation, Dr Shoeb Syed, emphasised that postgraduate students deal with research, hence academic integrity must always be part of their work ethic.
“So, in academic integrity, plagiarism comes in. It plays a part in it,” he stated. “You don’t copy somebody else’s work and declare that ‘It’s my work’. That’s nothing but plagiarism. And it’s a very big sin in academia.
“That’s why you have to be careful about plagiarism.”
To avoid the consequences of plagiarism, such as disciplinary actions or damage to reputation, proper citation needs to be given.
“If you take someone’s work, you cite it,” continued Dr Syed, who has been at Unitech since 2019.
“You tell them that, ok, I am using from his work. When you do that, then you are free from plagiarism.
“In many universities, there are dire consequences for it. They will remove you from your studies completely. They’ll investigate you so you will not be able to complete your studies. In other countries, you won’t even be able to enter other universities.”
Dr Syed also encouraged the postgraduate students to aim for excellence in their respective fields.
Unitech’s postgraduate school offers 18 course-based master’s programs, 22 Master of Philosophy programs and 22 Doctor of Philosophy programs; a total of 62 programs offered by the 13 academic schools. This is the largest range of postgraduate programs offered in the country.
This year, 239 students have enrolled for the two semesters. This consists of 104 new students and 135 continuing students.
This year has seen an increase of 79 students for postgraduate studies, including a Queen Elizabeth Commonwealth Scholar who will be pursuing his Master of Engineering in Civil Engineering."

Public servants working remotely directed to relocate,3/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3412,,Government,Trust,Nill,"The Ombudsman Commission has directed all public servants operating out of their provinces to relocate to their designated locations.
The OC issued the directive on February 6th to all provincial administrators and staff, the district chief executive officers, and staff who are operating outside to immediately relocate to their rightful place of work. The directive takes effect on Thursday, March 6th, 2025.
In a statement, the Ombudsman Commission highlighted that they were aware of public servants operating outside the designated locations or in Port Moresby.
“Operating outside the designated location is improper as there are legally defined administrative boundaries within which these Public Servants must serve.
“This practice not only disrupts effective service delivery to the respective Provinces and Districts but it also undermines the principles of good governance, accountability and transparency,” said the Ombudsman Commission.
“It is imperative for all relevant Provincial Administrators, the Provincial Administration Staff, the Chief Executive Officers of the District Development Authorities, and the District Administration Staff to take note and cooperate with the Ombudsman Commission by relocating to their designated locations.
“As leaders, the provincial administrators and the CEOs of the DDAs are required under Section 23 of the Organic Law on the Duties and Responsibilities of Leadership to co-operate with the Ombudsman Commission.”
The Ombudsman further stated that the provincial, DDA and district administration staff, are persons to whom the National Goals and Directive Principles and the Basic Social Obligations apply and they must act in the spirit of the Constitution by giving effect to the National Goals and Directive Principles.
“You are therefore encouraged to comply with the Basic Social Obligations as far as it is within your respective powers to relocate immediately and perform your duties in the provinces and districts.
“Should you fail to comply with this Directive, you may be subject to enforcement proceedings in the National Court under Section 23 of the Constitution.”

"Dreger students seek refuge, situation still tense",3/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3410,,Education,Fear,Nill,"Over 40 students are seeking refuge at the Gagidu Police Station, in Finschhafen, Morobe Province, following a drunken brawl at the Dregerhafen Secondary School.
Gagidu Rural Police Station Commander, Inspector Dominic Livar, said the fight was instigated yesterday by intoxicated individuals from Pindiu, in the Hube Rural Local Level Government (LLG).
Based on reports, Mape students retaliated after the group from Hube allegedly damaged their pots and plates when the Mape group refused to share food with them.
Fighting ensued and an old ablution building that was converted into a makeshift dormitory was burnt down.
“There was no loss of life but tension is very high,” said Inspector Livar.
It is also understood that three Mape students were cut around that time, however, police are yet to establish whether that is from the confrontation with Hube students or prior to that.
Innocent students are affected by the incident, with those from Sialum and Pindiu seeking refuge at the Gagidu police barracks.
“This morning, I went into Dreger, the school was having an emergency meeting. Currently, there are no classes as well,” said Inspector Livar.
“We will be monitoring the situation for the next few days then the board will reconvene and we will seek directions from the Morobe Provincial Education Board.
“We are anticipating a retaliatory attack from Pindiu, and our hands are tied because we are also attending to an attack on two of our police personnel at Sattelberg. They were grievously wounded by over 20 youths there on the evening of February 26th. We are investigating to determine the cause of the attack.”
Finschhafen has three regular police officers, around 15 reservists, and an additional boost of manpower from the Mobile Squad 10 from Port Moresby, brought in by the local MP, and have been on ground since December 2024."
"Law and order crisis result of neglect over years, PM says",3/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3416,,Politics,Anger,"James Marape, James Nomane","Prime Minister James Marape in rejecting calls for his resignation said the law and order crisis in PNG is a result of years of neglect by successive governments.
The Prime Minister in a statement said the law and order crisis the country is going through was not a sudden problem.
“We inherited a force in complete decline with little capacity at every level. Even the commissioner’s office lacked resources and trained personnel.”
Despite this, he stressed that he has personally taken steps to restore discipline, resources, and leadership within the police force, including:
• Increased police training and recruitment, which he says has been absent for over a decade.
• Major reforms to strengthen the police force, including re-training officers and improving command structures.
• And improved coordination between security agencies, including Defence, National Intelligence, and the Attorney General’s Department.
“Despite these challenges, we are rebuilding the system. These reforms take time. Simply replacing a Prime Minister, Minister, or Police Commissioner will not solve anything overnight.”
Responding to calls for his resignation, he described these calls as reckless and coming from political opportunists to exploit social tensions for political gain.
“From my end, I see a pattern emerging from the Deputy Opposition Leader James Nomane, and I am not surprised. Some in the opposition believe they can ascend to government by exploiting social issues and tensions on the ground. This modus operandi has become apparent,” Prime Minister Marape said. He even likened this trend to that of January 10, 2024, claiming that senior MP approached him back then in the presence of the Deputy Prime Minister and a provincial governor and urged him to resign, claiming he had lost public support and that lawlessness had worsened.
“Days later, the January 10 unrest happened, and suddenly, the calls for my resignation became louder. Now, I see history repeating itself,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister made it clear that resigning is not the solution to the challenges facing Papua New Guinea. “The job of a Prime Minister is not to resign at every crisis—it is to lead, coordinate, and allocate resources to address national challenges. That is exactly what we are doing.”
He emphasised that in 2024 alone, the government allocated the highest level of funding ever to police and law enforcement, taking real steps to fix the problems instead of simply shifting blame.
Meantime, the Pime Minister met with key security agencies, including the Police, Defence, Attorney General, National Intelligence Office (NIO), and Correctional Services (CS), and delivered a blunt message:
“It is time for them to step up and deliver. Our government is providing them with more resources than any past administration, and in return, we expect results. It is not the Prime Minister’s job to micromanage their responsibilities—they must work around the clock to restore law and order. If anyone should be working 20 hours a day, it is the police and all security agency heads.”"
Workshop to improve police training standards,3/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3414,,Government,Trust,Nill,"The National Center of Excellence recently conducted a two-day leadership workshop aimed at monitoring and evaluating the training component of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC).
A workshop was held on February 26 and 27, which brought together trainers within the Royal PNGC to review the training modules of the force, identify issues, and create dialogue on how to deal with those issues. The PNG-Australian Policing Partnership funded the workshop.
Assistant Commissioner of Police, Perou N’Dranou said misconceptions surrounding the training component of the force warranted the need to have this workshop and improve training standards.
He said some of the plans outlined in the workshop included looking at how to increase the training program and better train recruits to the true police force standards.
The ACP hopes for similar workshops to be held annually to ensure trainers are well prepared to train recruits."
Gov’t to strengthen security enforcement,3/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3400,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Amid growing security concerns in the county, the government has reaffirmed its commitment to strengthening law enforcement with police operations to intensity across the country to crack down on criminals and bring offenders to justice.
The Prime Minister, James Marape in a statement released recently said, “I have issued a direct instruction to the Police Commissioner to step up enforcement. While resources may sometimes be stretched, I want to assure the people of Papua New Guinea that no crime is ignored.
“Every case is documented, every offender is pursued, and justice will be done,” he assured.
He acknowledged that policing alone is not enough and called for a coordinated effort between law enforcement and community leaders.
“Police will arrest offenders, but it is the responsibility of Governors, councillors, and local leaders to ensure that peace is maintained within their communities.”
As Papua New Guinea approaches its 50th year of independence, the Prime Minister urged citizens to act responsibly and reject violence.
“We are not a young nation anymore. We are turning 50, and we must act like a mature country. Lawlessness should not define our future. I call on every citizen—young and old—to uphold the law, respect the rights of others, and work together to build a peaceful and prosperous Papua New Guinea.”
The Prime Minister concluded with a final appeal to all communities, especially those along the Highlands Highway.
“Do not destroy your future. Your road is a lifeline—it brings economic opportunity, education, healthcare, and development. Blocking it, damaging it, or intimidating those who use it will only harm your own people. Let us work together to maintain peace and order for the benefit of our nation.”"
Meri Freedom Bags Empowering Women,3/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3406,,Social,Joy,Nill,"As International Women's Day 2025 approaches, with its theme ""Accelerate Action,"" the spotlight turns to initiatives like Meri Freedom Bags that embody this call to expedite gender equality.
Founded in 2019 by Ipswich local Gay Muller, Meri Freedom Bags has made significant strides in empowering women and girls in Papua New Guinea by addressing menstrual health challenges and fostering economic independence.
The organization has distributed over 6,000 reusable menstrual hygiene kits across PNG, providing essential items such as washable pads, underwear, and soap. These kits not only meet practical needs but also challenge cultural taboos surrounding menstruation, promoting dignity and confidence among recipients.
Beyond distribution, Meri Freedom Bags emphasises sustainability by training local communities to produce these kits. This initiative equips women with valuable sewing skills, fostering economic opportunities and self-reliance.
Such efforts align seamlessly with the International Women's Day 2025 theme, as they represent actionable steps toward accelerating gender equality.
The organization's impact extends further by enhancing school attendance among girls, reducing health risks associated with inadequate menstrual management, and challenging societal stigmas.
Meri Freedom Bags collaborated with Pamili Ministries in December 2024 to distribute 500 reusable sanitary bags in Rabaul, East New Britain, Papua New Guinea.
These contributions resonate with the broader goals of International Women's Day, emphasising rights, equality, and empowerment for all women and girls.
As we commemorate International Women's Day on March 8, 2025, the work of Meri Freedom Bags serves as a powerful example of how grassroots initiatives can drive meaningful change.
Through dedication and community collaboration, they are not only improving menstrual health but also uplifting the dignity and status of women in Papua New Guinea, embodying the essence of accelerating action for gender equality.

Call for respect of indigenous people,3/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3402,,Politics,Anger,"Lohia Boe Samuel, Powes Parkop","The total disrespect of the marginalized people of Motu Koita and Koiari of Central Province has resulted in the upsurge of law-and-order issues in the city.
Moresby Northwest MP, Lohia Boe Samuel has blamed the increased widespread lawlessness on the disrespect of the indigenous people of Port Moresby city.
“Our land has been taken away from us by illegal squatters and various governments over the past 50 years. Settlements have become a breeding ground for criminals because Members of Parliament have failed our people by allowing settlements to flourish.
“People in settlements have become our voters so we have allowed them to settle without proper planning.
“No proper planning has caused many of our kids to become illiterates and are without jobs and have been facing hardships,” Samuel stressed.
“When a community is neglected over a long period, the youths in that community soon build in their minds an “Us versus Them” mentality which eventually breeds competent and hatred in their hearts and minds. Like yeast it grows and grows and results in such heinous and disposable actions of rape and murder of innocent females.”
Samuel further stressed that it is no easy fix, and there is no easy solution as this time bomb has been created and has been allowed to brew by society and past and current governments for over 50 years.
“Fifty years of neglect and the marginalization of my people of Motu Koita has resulted in such law-and-order issues.”
Samuel said a joint task force or a Think-Tank should immediately be set up by the Governor of NCDC Powes Parkop which should include MPs in NCDC and Central, police and selected members of the public to discuss ideas to address pressing issues."
Two illegal miners killed in Porgera,3/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3396,,Local,Anger,Nill,"Two illegal miners were killed today by security forces providing security at Porgera Mine during an attempted incursion upon restricted areas of critical infrastructure in Porgera.

The incident occurred despite repeated warnings and community engagement that there would be no tolerance for illegally threatening critical infrastructure. He said things are made much worse when illegal miners threaten personnel and security forces with firearms or bush knives.
""During an attempted incursion into a restricted area of the Porgera facility, armed illegal miners discharged firearms at security personnel.
""Security Forces responded as they are expected, in defence of critical infrastructure and personnel. Two illegal miners were shot and killed during the incident.
""Security forces have been clear that we will not tolerate the illegal carriage of weapons any interference in critical infrastructure or communities by criminal elements.

Member for Koroba Lake Kopiago and Minister for Coffee, William Bando recently presented a K1 million cheque from the Koroba-Lake Kopiago District Development Authority (DDA) to the Department for Community Development and Religion, fulfilling its commitment to establish the District Community Development Centre (DCDC).
“This K1 million is a demonstration of our commitment to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed on October 15, 2024.
“This funding will enable us to build a modern two-story building in our remote district.”
Bando said the centre will serve as a hub for addressing critical issues such as law and order, family and sexual violence, community development, and small business (SME) support.
It will house over 50 workstations, conference facilities, and a crucial transit lodge for survivors of gender-based violence and sorcery-related violence.
“I'm incredibly proud to be part of this initiative, which will bring much-needed services and support to our people. Thank you to Minister Jason Peter and Secretary Jerry Ubase for their partnership and dedication to rural development.
“A big thank you to District Administrator Stanley Kutan and District CEO for their efforts in ensuring the land in Koroba Township is ready for construction."
PM calls on leaders to address lawlessness,2/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3394,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"All local leaders from the community to national levels have been urged to stand against lawlessness, and actively maintain peace in their respective areas.
“For the first time, my government has placed councilors on the payroll. If you want government support, you must first ensure that your communities are law-abiding. Your role is not to stand idly by while young people engage in reckless behavior—you must be the voice of authority in your communities,” he stated.
He stressed that MPs, governors, and local leaders must work together to prevent violence from escalating.
“Governors must ensure that peace and mediation teams in their provinces are functioning. If conflicts arise between different provinces, then peace mediation teams must be deployed immediately to resolve disputes before they spiral out of control.”
Recognising Papua New Guinea’s deep cultural traditions, the Prime Minister called for the restoration of community-based mediation and customary dispute-resolution mechanisms.
“In our culture, compensation and mediation play a critical role in resolving disputes. But these processes must be handled within the bounds of the law, led by village councillors, elders, and local authorities—not by mobs taking the law into their own hands,” he said.
He called on local communities to work with police rather than against them.
“If a crime has been committed, report it to the police and allow the justice system to function. Do not take matters into your own hands. If the police in your area are slow to act, escalate the issue to their superiors. Justice will be served, but it must be done legally.”"
Kapavore clarifies circulation of ART drugs,2/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3393,,Health,Fear,Elias Kapavore,"Minister for Health and MP for Pomio, Elias Kapavore has called on Papua New Guineans to always take precautionary measures against HIV.
Kapavore made this call after clarifying the misrepresented information on the recent announcement by US on the cancellation of USAID and Anti-retroviral medication.
The Health Minister clarified that all drugs and reagents are purchased by the Government of Papua New Guinea through UNICEF, while the Global Fund supports with operational funds and a few commodities through the principal recipient, World Vision.
“Our available stock is for more than a month. I already discussed with UNICEF and World Vision to fly some ART drugs into the country.”
Kapavore made this clarification after misinformation on the cancellation of USAID after pulling out of the World Health Organisation.
“To clear the misrepresented information on USAID and the Anti-retroviral relationship, our public must know that USAID does not buy any HIV commodities for PNG.”
He said PNG will not experience any shortage of ART as we received the Commodity Funds in March but the slow approval and cheque clearance process of the Central Bank is slowing down the circulation.
“We still have K3.2m at Bank of PNG yet to be cleared. The lead time from Order to drugs arrival in PNG is 6-8 months now so holdup along the process is affecting our supply chain. That is having a negative toll on us.
“Our full estimate for one year is K27m but last year was K10m (K17m deficit) and this year is thankfully K12.5m (yet K15m short).”
However, Kapavore said despite the circulation, all people in the country must always take precautionary measures against HIV.
He said the cumulative total has gone past 72,000 with 6500 new HIV cases a year.
Furthermore, he explained that 44,000 are on ART and PNG cannot afford to increase this number so all sexually active people must be sexually responsible ie:  keep sex within marriage, abstain from sex, and wear a condom if they cannot control themselves.
“Sex outside of marriage is a sin and wages of sin is death. Be responsible.”"
PM calls for respect of law,2/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3392,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has issued a powerful and unequivocal call to all Papua New Guineans to uphold the rule of law, warning that no amount of justification can validate criminal acts.
He has also condemned recent incidents of violence, destruction, and illegal roadblocks, stressing that these actions not only endanger lives but also undermine the country’s economic and social stability.
“There is no justification for breaking one law to seek justice for another crime. Lawlessness does not solve problems—it only deepens them.”
Prime Minister James Marape made these remarks when highlighting a recent case in Tari, where police, with the support of the local community, successfully arrested a suspect involved in the killing of a police officer.
“The perpetrator is now behind bars, and the legal process is underway. This is the correct course of action—justice through the law, not through retaliatory violence.”
The Prime Minister further condemned those who use criminal behavior as a means of drawing attention to grievances as no excuse and no justification can validate committing another crime to protest an existing one.
He added that resorting to violence, destruction, and intimidation does not solve problems but creates more victims.
Marape aimed at the destruction and disorder along the Highlands Highway, warning that such actions jeopardize the very livelihoods of the people involved.
“My government has invested over K2 billion into upgrading the Highlands Highway which is a national asset, crucial for economic activities such as agriculture, small businesses, trade, and tourism.”
Marape said blocking roads, setting vehicles alight, and destroying property is reckless and self-defeating."
"Breaking Stigmas, One Stitch At A Time",2/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3391,,Health,Joy,Nill,"On February 28, fourteen women and four men received certificates after successfully completing a three-day sewing workshop at the Ginigoada Centre at Tutu Beach Retreat.
The training, conducted by Meri Freedom Bags in partnership with Ginigoada Foundation Inc., focused on sewing reusable sanitary kits to support women and girls in Papua New Guinea.
Dame Carol Kidu, Patron of Ginigoada, and Gay Muller, Founder of Meri Freedom Bags, presented the certificates, recognizing the participants’ commitment to learning new skills that contribute to healthier and more resilient communities.
The program introduced sewing techniques and provided essential health awareness training on nutrition, reproductive health, and mental well-being.
Meri Freedom Bags, an Australian-based nonprofit, was founded by Muller after she witnessed the challenges faced by PNG women due to period stigma while working as a nurse on the YWAM medical ship. ""I saw that women were ostracized from their villages during their periods, and it affected their dignity,"" she said.
Participants overcame minor setbacks, including a broken snap locker, and completed at least one sanitary bag each. The remaining bags will be finished and distributed to girls in the upper grades at Pari Primary School on March 3.
Ginigoada has since established a sewing training room, allowing both men and women to continue developing their skills. With growing interest in future workshops, plans are already underway for further training sessions.
This initiative marks a significant step toward breaking stigmas, restoring dignity, and fostering sustainable local production of reusable sanitary kits to benefit more communities in PNG."

International bikers visit Snow Pass,1/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3386,,Tourism,Joy,Nill,"They have only heard of ‘Snow Pass’ until they woke up with a ‘million-dollar view’ of Usino-Bundi, in Madang Province.
This was expressed by a United States team of nine adventure dirt bikers who rode all the way from Lae, courtesy of the Lae-based operator, Niugini Dirt.
The team had toured countries like Africa, Nepal, Mongolia and Peru before choosing PNG on their 26th expedition.
The team chose Papua New Guinea through Niugini Dirt’s promotion of PNG as an adventure dirt biking destination.
From Lae, the team biked to Bulolo and up to Aseki, in Menyama. They then biked to Aiyura and Asaro in Eastern Highlands to meet the mudmen before arriving at Snow Pass, Bundi, on a cold and wet afternoon of Monday, February 24th.
Despite the wet weather and long ride, they were warmly welcomed by the community of Snow Pass. The team was lodged at Snow Pass Eco-lodge at 2,200m above sea level for the night.
Owner of the Snow Pass Eco-lodge and community advocate, Vincent Kumura, said:
“At the dawn of the 25th, the team woke up to the flames of the ‘Imure Burning Head Dancers’, a local cultural group of Karizokara, Bundi. The breathtaking rare performance was nothing like what they had seen before anywhere in the world.
“They left Snow Pass at 10.30am on February 25th.
“With the exceptional hospitality coupled with the striking cultural performance amidst a million-dollar view all around, there's no doubt that the team had left with an indelible rare cut of PNG’s tourism and hospitality, something we hope they would treasure and share with others for many years to come,” expressed Kumura.
Kumura further applauded Lae’s Niugini Dirt for promoting PNG as an adventure biking destination in the world."

The Commissioner’s comments follow two unrelated incidents that caused the temporary closure of the Highway, one being illegal activity and the other a vehicle fire.
“Both matters are under investigation and one arrest has been made with more to follow,” Commissioner Manning said.
“Our policing environment remains challenging, but our investment in leadership and the front line is ensuring we are able to resolve highly-volatile matters more promptly and more professionally.
“This critical roadway was opened promptly by police, and remains open for use by the public.
“High-visibility police patrols of the highway and community engagement will continue to address issues that led to this unacceptable effort to impede the Highlands Highway.”
The closures occurred over two days with police removing an illegal roadblock near Goroka on Thursday, 27 February. Police also attended to a vehicle on fire near Mt. Hagen, early yesterday morning, 28 February.
While unrelated, both incidents caused the temporary closure of the Highlands Highway that Commissioner Manning said is unacceptable.
“The Highlands Highway is critical infrastructure, central to the welfare of communities across the region, particularly our SMEs moving their crops to market.
“Police are working closely with community Leaders to address grievances and together identify those who would cause harm.
“Communities have every right to air their concerns, however interrupting the highway is not the right way to do it.
“I have been briefed that families and communities involved have since presented a petition, and I am pleased to see community leaders step up and receive this petition.
“I expect community leaders to deliver on their duty. This means working with their communities, and with police, to ease tensions.”

Guinness happy with barracks project,28/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3377,,Government,Trust,Nill,"Accommodating members of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary continues to be a challenge nationwide. Assistant Commissioner of Police – Northern Command, Peter Guinness, during the quarterly Northern Command conference in Madang yesterday, stated that many unmarried police personnel are renting and it’s proven to be an expensive exercise, and more so contributes to their welfare issues.
ACP Guinness condemned negative public perceptions about the recently built barracks in Madang, constructed by Pacific AR Limited at a cost of K160,000.00. He said this project is a positive step towards alleviating accommodation challenges faced by RPNGC members in Madang, and addresses issues like low retention rates of police personnel in Madang. ACP Guinness said police personnel would leave the Madang Command after a short while because accommodation was always an issue.
The Madang Provincial Government has also allocated K3 million towards the construction of the Kusbau barracks. Guinness acknowledged this support including the purchase of 20 vehicles and 8 dinghies for the Madang Police Command. He said they will be dispatched soon.
He went on to applaud the PPC and members of the Madang police command for continued efforts in maintaining active relationships with the provincial government and communities in addressing and maintaining law and order issues."

Governor Powi issued this direction in front of thousands of people including the Attorney General Pila Niningi and other members of parliament and the police hierarchy who were present for the passing out of 351 SHP reserve police in Mendi yesterday.
He also expressed sympathy on behalf of the Southern Highlands Provincial government to the families who are currently mourning the deaths of the police officers and appealed for them to refrain from illegal roadblocks and other illegal ways as this will bring further pain and suffering to innocent people.
Meantime, it is understood that the governor and the Member for Mendi Raphael Tonpi have consulted with the Member for Goroka, Aiye Tambua to make contribution and to convey their condolences to the families in Port Moresby."
Major drug bust in Mis,28/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3372,,Crime,Trust,Ramsey Pariwa,"A dawn raid by an active community policing unit (CPU) in Ward Four of Mis village in Madang’s North Ambenob LLG, resulted in the confiscation of cannabis with a street value of at least K100,000.

Preserving the Kumul,28/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3368,,Conservation,Joy,Nill,"At the heart of Papua New Guinea’s rich natural heritage lies its national bird, the Raggiana Bird of Paradise, or the 'Kumul'. This bird, with its vibrant plumage and symbolic presence on the nation’s flag, is more than a creature of beauty-it is a testament to the cultural and natural wealth of PNG.
In a groundbreaking achievement, the Port Moresby Nature Park has successfully bred the Raggiana Bird of Paradise for the second time in just four years. This rare accomplishment reflects years of meticulous effort by the Park’s wildlife team.
Acting Conservation Manager, Francis Otto Gundu said, “So here at Port Moresby Nature Park we have breeding programs for different species of animals especially the endangered species and even the protected ones. Breeding of the Bird of Paradise is one of our breeding programs. The successful breeding of this species of the Bird of Paradise is like a great achievement for the park and the country.”
Behind the scenes, the breeding process was a delicate balance of science and care.
Gundu said, ""There are certain challenges that we faced while hand raising the chicks. Some challenges we faced is we need some appropriate items like incubators in order to make the successful breeding of these chicks. Because sometimes when we have the bird of paradise laying their eggs in their natural homes and the fact that we allow animals to coexist, they destroy the eggs and there is no chance of breeding system.”
“Apart from equipment we will need more aviaries for breeding more Birds of Paradise species.
""The last time that we bred this species was four years ago so during the three years we have been working really hard to come to this stage of re-breeding these species. There are certain techniques and skills in mastering these enclosures, (and) diet we have been working on improving.
A significant part of the Park’s mission is the 'Lukautim Bilas Bilong Yu' campaign, which aims to protect the Raggiana Bird of Paradise while respecting PNG’s cultural heritage.
""This is one of the three campaigns that we have here in the park. The main objective is to make sure that we don't hunt. Like most Papua New Guineans, we use the feathers to make traditional costumes. But if we continue to hunt, the number of wild birds will decline and eventually, we will not see this beautiful species.
“So as much as possible we are trying to educate our general guests to look after their feathers. So, during our talks we normally introduce different ways the general public can look after their bilas and we even give them alternatives like dying chicken feathers.
“Imagine, it takes 27 feathers of a bird of paradise to make one headdress. So (if) we are trying to have traditional costumes, imagine the destruction we are going to cause to the wild population,” he added.
Beyond conservation, the Nature Park plays a crucial role in educating future generations and engaging the community. Through various visitor programs, it connects people with the local flora and fauna, helping to raise awareness about how native species are linked to traditions and customs.
Building on the hands-on dedication, the broader vision and global significance of the park’s achievements come into focus through the insights of CEO John Paul Houston, whose leadership underscores the collective effort behind this conservation success.
Houston said, “All birds of paradise are well known as one of the more complicated things to breed, so we’re incredibly proud of all of our keepers who have worked hard to gain these skills necessary and grow with the species we have here. Everybody is massively dedicated to what they do, all of the keeping staff and animal team, and all of the staff in general around the park, all pitch in in some way or other. So to watch people get one step closer every time from egg to hatching the chick to rearing the chick to now having birds flying around in aviaries it’s been a testament really to what the staff here can do.”
The park’s global impact is also a key highlight, with Houston noting how this success puts Papua New Guinea on the world stage.
He said, “We breed multiple species of bird here, working towards sustainable populations for the park to display for educational purposes for the thirty thousand plus school children in a year that come through. It puts us on a great standing with the world.”
“Conservation of species, sustainability, education in terms of climate change and biodiversity in PNG is an endless job. And so, we call to anyone who can help, please do help through the Corporate Social Responsibility or otherwise, we always need the support,” Houston remarked.
As Papua New Guinea is set to celebrate its 50th year of Independence, the successful breeding of the Raggiana Bird of Paradise symbolizes what can be achieved through passion, innovation, and collaboration. It reminds us that preserving our natural heritage is not just about protecting a species but safeguarding the soul of a nation."

The new hospital will also contribute to a wider network of health facilities whose construction was supported by Australia in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville: Orami and Kodora community health posts in South Bougainville; Karato and Kakusida community health posts in Central Bougainville; and the new health centre being built at Soroken.
In providing funding for each of these health facilities, Australia ensures that these projects are buying supplies from and creating job opportunities for local communities, ensuring they receive not just health but wider economic benefits.
Australia is committed to supporting the health sector in Papua New Guinea. In the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, this also includes funding for routine immunisation for children, strengthening HIV services, and providing strategic support to the Bougainville Department of Health."
Reflections on Sir Michael Somare,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3363,,Politics,Gratitude,Nill,"“My reflections on Sir Michael (Somare) have always been admiration and gratitude.
“I admired his ability to relate to people from all walks of life and his ability to inspire people from our many tribes to be one nation.
“I am also grateful for the opportunities that he gave me even when opposed by other MPs and Parties.
“Ministries are usually allocated according to the number of MPs a Party brings to the coalition.
“In both 2002 and 2007, the Melanesian Alliance did not have enough members to warrant giving me a Ministry but he ignored the objections from other MPs and firmly told them that it was not negotiable and gave me the Ministry that I wanted.
“I am grateful for his confidence in me and for the opportunity that he gave me to make some significant policy and legislative reforms in the social sector.
“We are truly blessed as a nation to have had him as our founding father.

Madang Council of Women elects new president,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3358,,Local,Anticipation,Jim Kas,"Theresa Kamau Kas, wife of former Madang Governor Jim Kas is the new president of the Madang Provincial Council of Women following her successful election on Wednesday (February 26th).
The other council executives elected include Beverly Peniel from Raicoast as Treasurer, Jessica Morosa from Sumkar as Secretary and Victoria Jano from Bogia as Vice President.
The women thanked the provincial electoral office for successfully coordinating their elections, and ensuring Madang women are represented in the Council of Women.
The women acknowledged the support of the provincial Electoral Commission in hosting coordinated elections in a bottom-up approach, starting from each ward, the local level government, districts, and finally to have the provincial election completed.
The Middle Ramu missed out on the election, as logistics could not allow for its inclusion and also due to its geographical location. However, they have coordinated their elections which will be updated once data is received. Most of the elections conducted in the five districts were qualified by a 50 percent plus 1 or 2 method due to remoteness, meaning so long as 50 percent or more of wards or LLGs present.
The 20 women elected were given an awareness of the background of the Council of Women and of how voting was to be conducted as many were new to the council that were elected. The voting system used was first past the post.
In her official speech, Mrs Kas did not waste time but made her intentions known as president of the Madang Council of Women to compete in the National Council of Women for the presidency seat.
“I’m not just standing up as President for Madang but I intend to contend the National Council of Women president seat as well. For far too long our issues have not been addressed, and I’m ready to put my hands up,” Mrs. Kas stated.
The women once taking office highlighted crucial pointers to raise internally, and also plan to attend the Women’s Convention in Kavieng from the 23rd – 28th of March, to coincide with International Women’s Day."
Woman injured in self-defense,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3348,,Local,Fear,Nill,"A young woman in Port Moresby almost lost her fingers whilst defending herself as a knife-wielding thug swung at her in an attempt to rob her.
Eunice Kanamabae in recounting her ordeal encouraged residents, especially females of Port Moresby to be vigilant and to prioritize their lives over belongings when they are confronted by thugs.
It was a normal morning for Eunice Kanamabae as she stepped out of her house at Hohola on Sunday, 23rd February. She was confronted by a thug and it all happened so fast and she is appalled at how this all happened within her neighborhood.
“I was waiting for my work pick-up at Hohola, as I took out my phone to message my driver. This young man approached me and removed a knife whilst asking for my belongings. I stood up and he swung the knife. I blocked myself and he cut my fingers. I ran towards a group of men (who didn’t see what happened) and they managed to chase him, however, he got away.”
Fortunately, Eunice works for Glorious Medical Centre and was able to get urgent medical attention. She regrettably recounted how she should have acted differently to avoid getting her fingers cut.
“I regret taking my phone out in public, I should have stayed at home and alerted the driver and I also should have given him the phone. But I was in panic mode and the things I thought I should have done, didn’t come to mind.”
Eunice went on social media to tell her story and advised young women in the city to take precautions and be on alert when in public.
“Port Moresby is no longer safe, especially for women who are walking around alone and I urged that women should take extra precautions and be safe. When the incident happened, I screamed and was able to alert other people around me. But if you are alone and there is no one around you just give in and give your belongings to these thugs, your life is more important, I could have lost my fingers just because of my phone.”
Now, Eunice is awaiting a medical report to take the matter to the police station for further investigations. She has a clear depiction of the young man and says she won’t back down until the young man is behind bars.
“I think the Government should look at these petty crimes because it’s the petty crimes that lead to big crimes. The government should look at solutions to minimize the crime rates in the city. Maybe provide more job opportunities to the youths living in those areas to watch the neighborhood or bus stop wardens. I think that’s a good initiative and they should carry that out more often.”"
MP dissatisfied with provincial budget,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3345,,Politics,Anger,"John Rosso, Koni Iguan, Luther Wenge","Some MPs of Morobe Province were absent during Monday’s (Feb 24) budget session at Tutumang Haus to show their dissatisfaction.
Markham MP and Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Koni Iguan, outlined this after the Morobe Governor and provincial finance chairman, Luther Wenge, presented an expenditure budget of K723.96 million for this year.
“In the morning, I checked some of them and they gave their apologies for not attending as they are away, while others expressed their frustration, saying they do not want to attend the budget meeting because they believe that their districts are missing out in the provincial budget,” said Iguan.
“They are saying, what is the purpose of us attending and debating when we don’t get anything, and we don’t see anything in our districts from the provincial budget. So, the only thing to do is to abstain.
“I told them that I also want to abstain but I need to attend and speak my mind.”
Iguan thanked the Governor and budget committee for delivering the budget and noted that Zumara Primary School in his electorate has been listed as an impact project under the ‘infrastructure development grant’.
“It’s listed there but I don’t know how much is being allocated. I’m looking for Markham’s portion here but maybe I’ll go back and have a good look.
“Have you seen the condition of the Wantoat road? A lot of our people have died from vehicle accidents there. Never at one time has this provincial government allocated funding for the Leron-Wantoat Road.
“My district services improvement program (DSIP) funds are insufficient. I truly thought I would get a share of this pig,” he figuratively stressed.
“I will invite the provincial budget team including you, the governor, as the chairman, to my district development authority meeting.
“There’s no consultation in this budget,” he fired at the Provincial Executive Council.
He further debated Governor Wenge’s description of the IDG as “shadow money” that was enveloped in “a lot of controversies”.
“Tie it up with projects and name it in the budget. Don’t put it as ‘shadow’ because once it stays as shadow, it will be at anybody’s discretion. We might not know where that money is going.
“We cannot blame the governor. Those in the administration, are you aware of Markham’s challenges?”
He outlined that he and the Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, had already pledged a 4-in-1 classroom for Zumara Primary School while the Markham DDA will construct a teacher’s house. MPG’s allocation of a double classroom was not welcomed by the MP.
“If there had been consultation, we would have allocated that money to other schools that are in dire need of support.”"

TKCP accommodates 3 wards in Nayudo,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3360,,Local,Trust,Nill,"Eighteen ward councilors from Morobe and Madang province are proud they have delivered draft development plans, setting the foundations of having their community development needs met. The Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program (TKCP), established in the Yus LLG of Kabwum District, Morobe Province, provided the technical support in drafting these ward plans, managing to include 3 wards in the Nayudo LLG of Rai Coast District, Madang Province.
In Morobe, they drafted 12 ward plans for Yus LLG in Kabwum and three ward plans for Wasu LLG in Tewae-Siassi. The 18 ward councillors had to undergo a week’s planning meeting in Lae to put together respective draft ward plans. TKCP facilitated the program under its Financial Literacy program. Funding for this workshop was provided by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, through its Biodiversity Protection and Management Area program.
TKCP partners with Yus LLG and its sister LLGs in Wasu and Nayudo. It promotes conservation efforts that includes the livelihood of local communities and basic development needs in education, health and socio-economic activities like coffee and cocoa projects.  TKCP facilitates land use planning, which is a key development tool that helps local stakeholders to better plan and manage their land and natural resources besides other development needs.
Modi Pontio, TKCP Associate Director was thrilled to meet with the councilors and witness their progress. She reminded the councilors that their integrated ward development plan has to be completed in their ward areas in close consultation with their ward development committees, effecting the theme of ‘Strengthening Community-Based governance and management for Papua New Guinea’s Yus Conservation Area’. She added that service delivery and infrastructure is not part of TKCP’s program priorities, hence the ward development plan in draft will assist to cater for these.
Meantime, Tewae Siassi District Administrator Sam Engam emphasized that partnership and proper consultation with the government is crucial in all of this planning.
In support this government and NGO partnership, Nayudo LLG president, Senuka Kaku, pledged K15, 000 to the Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program to support the development of community-based organizations, including the 3 wards of Upper Nankina in Nayudo and into the Yus Conservation Area."

The disgruntled parents were students from Tusbab’s feeder schools - Kusbau, Gum and Jomba primary schools, who believed their children should be prioritised.
With a growing number of grade 8 students coming out of primary schools in Madang, Tusbab when school resumed prioritised students who had achieved higher pass marks.
Tusbab deputy principal - administration Michael Camillus Kavagu said, “The cut-off criterion was 63 percent but unfortunately, students who did well over 70 percent were given priority and accepted.
This issue was escalated to the Acting Education director, Alphonse Igag to pursue the matter with Town Mayor Peter Yalsy to accommodate more classrooms. Over two weeks, Mr. Yalsy and the Tusbab administration sought avenues and accommodated two more classrooms. Today the unaccounted-for students are in class.
The school principal said, “Most times, it is the grade nines that require extra attention at the beginning of the year, mostly about selection and spacing.
He said roughly there are 500 students in grade 9 and with the inclusion of two new classes, there are eight grade nine classes – this is about 60 students in each class.
“With free education, the number of students graduating out of grade eight increases every year; and the call for infrastructural development in terms of classrooms remains.”
Meantime, Yalsy elaborated that with the government’s policy of ‘Leave no child behind’ and the incorporation of 1:6:6, and the elimination of exams, he is calling on the National Education Department to build more classrooms and upgrade primary schools into Junior High Schools to avoid such instances."

When giving a brief on the status of the infrastructure projects in Rabaul district, the acting District Administrator, Freddy Lemeki, said these projects were approved last year through the Provincial Procurement Committee, and work has started for most.
He outlined that these impact projects are important for fostering economic development and enhancing tourism.
“The Blanche Road along the beach front is a vital economic road that connects our sea ports with the market and business houses; it links our supply food chain. Not only does it connect us to the wharves but it is also the gateway to our cruise ships berthing,” said Lemeki.
He further thanked the contractor, Nivani Ltd, for completing phase 1 of the Blanche Road rehabilitation project, and also commended the Provincial Government for co-funding it.
Phase 2 of the project has started with the clearance of silt underway.
Meantime, Rabaul district roads supervisor, Jude Gigiala, also gave a brief on the status of the Tunnel Hill Road, outlining that this stretch of the road has been deteriorating over the years.
The project was awarded to Nivani Ltd last year for K2.2 million under the infrastructure development program and is 33 percent complete.
He said this is another historical and tourism road that leads up to the Haus Guria or Volcano Observatory, and also the Nonga Base Provincial Hospital.
“This project starts from Rabaul Police Station (Checkpoint) and goes down to Toleap Junction towards the Nonga Road, which is about 2.3km and so far, Nivani Ltd is doing drainage works and edge beams repairs,” said Gigiala.
He added that 2,000m of edge beams along the road have been constructed and after that, they would do pavement repairs and then sealing of the road.
The district roads supervisor further said they will also continue with emergency road works and attending to resettlement roads as part of their programs this year."

Change looming in NCD Police,26/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3339,,Politics,Trust,Nill,"The NCD Police is expected to make major changes within the zone command, a move to address the escalating law and order issue and instill police discipline.
The change is imminent with the three zone commanders to be replaced with just one commander, says Assistant Commissioner of Police for NCD/ Central, Benjamin Turi.
He said these changes are necessary to address some issues that were brought to his attention.
When speaking to the media on Tuesday, Turi said law and order issues are escalating in the city with many investigations from years still pending and not completed on time and to the expectation of the force.
He said many members of the force have also been involved in certain crimes committed and blamed the lack of management by the three-zone commanders.
Turi said zone commanders are not performing to expectations, leading to negligence and complacency issues in the force.
Therefore, Turi has taken an approach to do away with the three-zone commanders and appoint one commander who will oversee all operations. This is to maintain command and control in the force.
“I am removing people who are weak without no strength of character to lead and discipline people in the command,” he said.
Turi said cutting down on police hire cars is another action that will be implemented to ensure fuel is preserved and used for operations purposes. This year, all police hire cars will be removed in both the NCD and Central Command.
ACP Turi said police officers are warned to make five arrests in a day and submit their report. Those who do not make an arrest will be given a warning to find another job or move out from the force. This approach is taken to ensure police officers are working."

PNG highlights commitment to ENBi,26/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3335,,Business,Anticipation,Jelta Wong,"Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources, Jelta Wong, this week addressed the gathering of Pacific Island Leaders on the East New Britain Initiative (ENBi) during the Honiara Summit on Sustainable Fisheries.
He emphasised the vision behind ENBi as a collaborative platform aimed at enhancing coordination and cooperation among Pacific Island countries to advance shared aspirations for sustainable tuna fisheries development.
In the first quarter of 2024, PNG committed to the success of ENBi through the allocation of over K1.8 million (US$500,000) to the Forum Fisheries Agency to fund the ENBi program and activities, recognizing the potential it holds for all Pacific countries.
ENBi ENBi not only focuses on hubs and spokes and the retention of tuna value in the region but also on the establishment of a Regional Fisheries Development Fund, which will benefit all Pacific Island nations.
“I am pleased to note that progress has been made to begin this work, with the support of our development partner, the European Union. I encourage the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) to work jointly with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in formulating the Regional Fisheries Development Fund,” Minister Wong said.
“When discussing the retention of value from our region’s tuna catches, we are reminded of the many challenges facing Pacific Island nations,” he added.
“These challenges include inadequate infrastructure, unreliable utilities, high operational costs, limited skilled labor, and geographical remoteness from major markets.”
“These challenges will persist if we continue to operate independently, with each Pacific country pursuing tuna fishing and processing investments in isolation. ENBi seeks to shift this paradigm by promoting regional collaboration and leveraging our collective strengths.”
Minister Wong emphasized that stakeholders recognize the immense value Pacific nations bring as custodians of some of the world’s best-managed tuna resources. ENBi serves as a platform for Pacific Island countries to identify strategic entry points, form alliances, and actively participate in commercial tuna ventures and supporting industries.
“The essence of our Pacific way of life is at stake if we allow ourselves to be controlled by external forces dictating global prices,” Minister Wong added.
“We are the rightful stewards of our resources.  We must unite as a cohesive region, rather than allowing ourselves to be picked off one by one. We must cultivate a narrative that reflects our collective identity, with ENBi as our vital connection.”
Minister Wong is hopeful that one day the ENBi logo will be on canned tuna products, signaling to customers that the benefits derived from the catch, processing, and sale of these products are shared by multiple Pacific Island countries. To realize this, all Pacific nations must work with eco-label organizations and internationally recognized NGOs to amplify their message.
“Papua New Guinea aims to position itself as a regional tuna processing hub, similar to several other Pacific countries. PNG operates six processing plants, with a combined designed daily processing capacity of over 1,000 metric tonnes,” said Minister Wong.
“While this is an achievement, we recognize the need for continued improvement, particularly in implementing policies that support investment, industry expansion, and operational efficiency.”
“We are working on securing fiscal incentives and developing Fisheries Special Economic Zones to attract investment from other Pacific countries and their respective partners. I know we’ve been discussing this for over a decade, but I am confident that ENBi can be the catalyst, and the participation of other countries can be the key to finally realizing this concept.”
In closing, Minister Wong highlighted that “ENBi has received strong endorsement from FFC Ministers and Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, reflecting its significance for our region.”
“I therefore urge each of us to actively engage with ENBi’s initiatives and collaborate with your colleagues and the ENBi Working Group. As Gandhi famously said, all good thoughts and ideas mean nothing without action.”
“Together, we can realize the vision of maximizing the value of our region’s tuna resources for the benefit of all Pacific nations. Our Pacific Islands Forum family represents 18 Large Ocean States, each with dreams and aspirations for economic empowerment. These 18 large Ocean states represent over 10 percent of the UN family.”
He concluded by quoting the Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum, Baron Waqa, “We are at the center of strategic geopolitical interest. We own the strategic potential of our collective, and together, we reaffirm that we act from a position of strength. We must not forget this.”"
Forensic investigation into Baruni murder continue,25/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3325,,Crime,Trust,Nill,"DNA samples and related evidence have been secured by Police Forensic experts following the arrest of three persons in connection with the murder of a 23-year-old woman in Baruni on Saturday, 15 February 2025.
The investigative breakthrough follows the appointment of two medical professionals as the Royal PNG Constabulary Special Constables, ensuring that critical DNA evidence can be obtained promptly and professionally.
Commissioner of Police, David Manning, confirmed the identification and collection of advanced forensic evidence was supported by specialist forensic advisory support from the Australian Federal Police.
""I am pleased to see the responsive support of the AFP in this matter, with experienced forensics officers providing on-the-shoulder advice and mentoring to RPNGC Specialists, Commissioner Manning said.
""This vulgar crime tears at the fabric of our society. It is right that we put every available resource into ensuring every criminal involved in this terrible offence spends the rest of his life behind bars. Our investment in advanced forensics means we are now able to secure and present irrefutable forensics evidence to be used in court to secure convictions,"" he said.
The breakthrough in forensics investigations follows the identification of a previously unknown offender during training of a digital fingerprint identification system. The application of a new digital fingerprint identification system identified a latent fingerprint from a historical stolen motor vehicle. This correlated with fingerprints recently obtained from the crime scene.
Commissioner Manning confirmed that while not highly-publicised, significant advances in forensics capabilities are being made in partnership with the support of regional policing partners.
""This is an area of policing where outcomes speak for themselves. Forensics evidence is critical in modern policing, and our forensics experts are now identifying criminals from fingerprints and DNA.""
""Fingerprints and DNA offer irrefutable evidence. Our investments in these capabilities are ensuring that those responsible for violent crimes are charged, tried in the Court, and sent to jail,"" Manning added."
Villagers appeal for police presence,25/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3324,,Local,Fear,Nill,"The people of Ainong, in the remote Simbai Local Level Government (LLG) of Middle Ramu, are appealing for police presence after their village was allegedly raided and destroyed by armed men.
The group of men, numbering at over 20, descended on the ward one village at around 10.30pm on Wednesday, November 14th, 2024, and chased residents, looted 21 homes, and burnt 14 to the ground.
While it has been three months since the incident, the ward one residents of Simbai LLG, in Madang Province, are unable to return and rebuild their homes as the group of armed men, from Womuk village, are still threatening them.
Currently, over 200 men, women and children have been displaced, and are seeking refuge at the Anglican Church.
Kovon community leader, Morrison Wiam, reached out to this newsroom on behalf of the displaced community, stressing that the community is living in fear.
He believes that the attack was in retaliation to the community reporting them for producing homebrew, gambling and disrupting the community, especially during a coffee show that was hosted on November 2nd, 2024.
“During that time, we saw drunkards chasing people so we reported to Madang police, including the Middle Ramu District Development Authority,” Wiam said.
“On November 4th, 2024, three policemen from Madang arrived with the District Administrator, Middle Ramu, Sucklyn Gi.
“The team were there in the early hours and ordered out the producers and suppliers of drugs and homebrew with their equipment. And at the same time, drunkards were also demanded by police to surrender.
“Locals were told to identify the suspects, who surrendered only a portion of their homebrew production equipment.
“The destruction was made 12 days later, after the three policemen left for Madang under a district chartered helicopter with Middle Ramu’s district administrator.”
Simbai is an inaccesible part of Madang that has no police station, no police personnel and no road connection.
The people are isolated and left to fend for themselves.
“We are appealing to our elected leaders, especially Member for Middle Ramu district and Governor of Madang, to work along with our village court officials and community leaders to deploy more manpower to strengthen law and order and make Ainong and Middle Ramu district a safer place,” said Wiam."
Marape challenges Nomane to outline his district achievements,25/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3327,,Politics,Anger,"James Marape, James Nomane","Prime Minister James Marape has issued a direct challenge to the Member for Chuave, James Nomane, calling on him to show the people of Chuave and Papua New Guinea what he has achieved with the funds allocated to his district.
The Prime Minister made this challenge after Nomane issued a statement calling on him to show cause on what the Government has done in addressing the law and order issues in the country rather than boasting about the inclusion of a NRL Team.
“I challenge Mr Nomane to show the people of Chuave and Papua New Guinea what he has achieved with the funds allocated to his district.
Leadership is about action and delivering results, not just rhetoric. The people of Chuave deserve to see tangible developments, not just political grandstanding,” said Prime Minister Marape.
“The Member for Chuave seems to believe we are a single-task government, but I must educate him that we are a multi-tasking government achieving far more than he could accomplish in five years.
“NRL is just one of many initiatives we are delivering for PNG.
As I reflect on our achievements while enroute to my next engagement, I recall just a few of the many developments we have undertaken.”
- Education: Over 100,000 school dropouts have been given a second chance through FODE, and over 10,000 additional students have been placed in tertiary institutions compared to 2018.

- Bougainville Peace Process: We are progressing the Bougainville Referendum outcomes and the Bougainville Peace Agreement.
- International Relations: We are enhancing diplomatic partnerships while prioritising PNG's national interests.
“I could list many more, but time does not permit,” said Prime Minister Marape.
“Challenges remain, but our government is actively addressing them rather than merely complaining and bickering, as some opposition members prefer to do.
“While Mr Nomane talks about rugby league, my government is delivering development across all sectors, including a record K15 million development funds for every district in 2024, including Chuave. I hope he is effectively using the K50 million he has received so far for the benefit of his constituents, rather than just engaging in media commentary.”
“Leadership is about action and context, not just criticism. I urge all young leaders to engage in meaningful service to their electorates while advocating for their positions,” Marape said."

The Braun Memorial District Hospital, run by Lutheran Health Services, is located on the southern side of the Mape River, in the Finschhafen district of Morobe Province.
It was initially constructed as the Butaweng Chest Hospital in 1958 – treating TB patients from all over Papua New Guinea – then upgraded to a health centre in 1974 when it was merged with an old World War II hospital called Buangi.
In 2011, the hospital had a national doctor, three expatriate doctors, 17 nurses and 25 community health workers (CHWs) serving the catchment areas of Finschhafen, Siassi and Kabwum.
Today, only a skeletal staff is on the ground; one national doctor serving over 30 patients a day, no health extension officer, and just a handful of nurses.
There is no running water, with patients – including mothers who have just delivered babies – forced to make the 5-7-minute walk to the nearby Butaweng Falls. Security is a major issue, with just 2 guards manning the gates on an ad hoc basis and no proper fencing. Patients and staff get robbed regularly; including those who walk to Butaweng to bathe.
Jelin Iveloks is from the mountain area of Pindiu, in the Hube Rural LLG. She has been at the hospital for 2 weeks now with two of her children and her teen niece, who has not enrolled in school but is taking care of her as her guardian. The teenager chops their firewood, prepares their meals and cooks for them, aside from washing their clothes and taking care of the children.
“We brought our own firewood from the village and are cooking our food,” she shared while struggling to hold her youngest son, a restless 2-year-old. “We have some relatives who live at Kiregen who bring the firewood to the boat landing at DCA, then we collect it and bring it up.”
The boat landing is at least a 5-minute drive to Gagidu Station, then it would take another 20 minutes to drive to Braun hospital.
“We live in the bush, on the border of Kabwum and Finschhafen. We’re right in the bushes; no roads for vehicles and our school is neglected so our children do not go to school.”
Jessica Sirip, who hails from the nearby Kolem village and Manus, was cooking with other women at the brick ‘haus kuk’.
“Patients at Butaweng have to provide everything. When it comes to firewood, those of us living nearby are ok, compared to our people from the mountains, who have to shoulder the burden. They have to bring everything; firewood, food, money, anything that is needed to survive here. The hospital also doesn’t have a proper mess to eat in, and our fathers and mothers, especially those with severe illnesses, are made to suffer even more.”
The last time the hospital had running water was in 2022. Since then, life has been difficult for staff, patients and students at the Braun Community Health Worker Training School.
It is hoped that the relevant authorities, including the district and Lutheran Health Services, can look into renovating the rundown infrastructure, boosting security at the hospital, installing a new water supply system, restocking their wards with much-needed medical equipment and look at lighting issues as well."
KPHL starts shooting seismic in Gulf Province,24/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3313,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"Kumul Petroleum Holdings Ltd has this month started gathering seismic data in its Barikewa petroleum retention licence in the Gulf Province.
Kumul Petroleum Managing Director, Wapu Sonk said its contractor, OilMin Holdings Limited, has for the last few months engaged with landowners, building camps, helipads and bridging, drilling holes for explosive charges, and laying out the recorders over approximately 80 kilometres in six seismic lines in two licences, and this week we have started data collection.
Mr Sonk explained that this was a historic moment - the first time a 100 percent national company had engaged in petroleum appraisal work in the country. The seismic work would gather additional information on gas already discovered in the two KPHL licences, to increase known volumes of oil and gas they contain, and improve targets for possible further drilling.
“From seismic results from the Barikewa field, and later in the Kimu field, we will have a better idea of the oil and gas volumes in these licences and be able to assess the economic feasibility of monetising the gas, and select a development path.”
Mr Sonk explained that the seismic work was in a remote area and helicopter-supported; that line cutting was a labour-intensive activity and the OilMin managed operation employed more than 300 local casual employees.
He noted that OilMin and Kumul Petroleum were also involved in small scale community development in communities close to the seismic work activities.
Mr Sonk explained further, “KPHL’s role is to maximise the financial returns that PNG receives from the natural resources it has been blessed with, supporting our economy and development as a country.”
“Now Kumul Petroleum Holdings is actively involved in upstream petroleum appraisal we can progress further commercialisation of PNG’s gas resources, in licences where these discoveries had previously been considered uneconomic and ‘stranded’ fields.”"
Watermark Estate residents meet to address security issues,23/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3304,,Local,Fear,Powes Parkop,"Residents of Watermark Estate in Port Moresby are concerned about their safety following the brutal murder of Magaret Gabriel on February 15th.
In a press conference held at the estate this afternoon, the residents called for an urgent intervention from the authorities to investigate the incident, apprehend those involved, and restore normalcy.
Spokesperson Dermott Bagasel recommended that a police post must be established at the estate to protect the community and deal with issues that are raised not only in the estate but surrounding communities as well.
Bagasel said another recommendation is to establish a community watch and partner with the police to recruit some of the residents to train as Police reservists.
He said establishing proper fencing and creating one gate entry are some of the interventions they are planning to implement.
“We will put our petition before Governor Powes Parkop and work with police to implement some of these recommendations,” Bagasel said.
Meanwhile, the residents will establish a committee to address community issues."
Badili police rescue woman from thugs,23/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3301,,Local,Fear,Nill,"Quick response from Badili Police officers and other support units prevented a woman from being harmed after a group of men dragged her from the Two-Mile Hill bus stop to the settlement on Saturday morning.
Police were notified by the public through the phone that a woman was dragged into the settlement by a group of men.
Officers on duty broadcasted the incident via the police radio and immediately responded and rescued the woman. However, the suspects escaped.
Commander NCD and Central Province Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi was pleased with the fast response from the police.
Turi said this issue reminds the public about the importance of knowing the police officers who are stationed in their electorate or suburb.
He called on the community to help police identify the suspects for police to apprehend them.
""Our mothers, daughters, and girls had been victims of such, and I am calling on everyone to help report such if they see it happening. If we don't report, we will later regret it when the victim got raped or killed. It's best to report it when the incident is about to happen. On that, I want to once again thank those who were involved in saving the female at Two Mile Hill, Commander Turi said.
Commander Turi also thanked the Koki Community Policing members who assisted the Badili units. He said they had been very supportive in their area of operation.
Turi warned the settlers that if issues such as rape and killing continue to escalate in their area, may result in demolishing of their properties."
NBPOL showcases growth and sustainability,23/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3305,,Business,Anticipation,Nill,"New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) has reaffirmed its commitment to the sustainable growth of Papua New Guinea’s palm oil industry during a high-level visit by the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC) delegation on Thursday, February 20, 2025.
NBPOL’s Chief Operating Officer (COO), Nik Maziah Nik Mustapha, presented an overview of the company’s operations and strategic direction to CPOPC Secretary General Dr. Rizal Affandi Lukman and other officials at the company’s headquarters in Mosa, West New Britain.
The visit comes as PNG formally became the fourth member of CPOPC on December 1, 2024, after a four-year wait. “Congratulations to the Papua New Guinea government, and we are very, very happy to be part of the palm oil industry for Papua New Guinea and contributing as well to CPOPC,” Nik Maziah said.
NBPOL, a subsidiary of SD Guthrie (formerly Sime Darby Plantation), operates across multiple provinces in PNG and the Solomon Islands. Nik Maziah emphasised the company’s adherence to sustainability standards, noting that “NBPOL is the only operation that has got 100 percent fully certified oil” under the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).
She highlighted that PNG’s oil palm sector is vital to economic development, supporting local employment and smallholder farmers. “Every fortnight… the kind of money that’s being churned out and traded after our pay week is significant to the economy of West New Britain and also to the other provinces that we operate in,” she said.
However, aging palm trees pose a major challenge for production. “Easily, 80% of our outgrowers’ palms are already above the age of 19, and 29% are more than 25 years old,” she said. She stressed the urgent need for replanting programmes and financial support for smallholder farmers, warning that “our CPO volume has been on a decreasing trend because of less productive farms contributing to our mills.”
With PNG now part of CPOPC, the country joins Malaysia, Indonesia, and Honduras in representing 84 percent of the world’s crude palm oil (CPO) production. “With including the observing countries, another four, it’s 88.9 percent,” Nik Maziah stated, reinforcing PNG’s position as a key player in the global market.
However, international trade barriers remain a concern. “The global palm oil industry is under scrutiny… and it should be a win-win situation where a country is expected to preserve its nature, then some other country who’s benefiting must pay for these carbon credits,” she said, about increasing environmental regulations on palm oil exports.
She also underscored the need for PNG to establish its palm oil certification system, similar to Malaysia’s MSPO and Indonesia’s ISPO. “If PNG can have its certification, it will be able to sustain itself to the larger markets outside of just Europe,” she said."
Madang police chief calls for unity,23/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3299,,National,Trust,"Julius Chan, Sir Julius Chan","As Papua New Guinea gears up for its 50th independence anniversary, Madang Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim has issued a heartfelt call for unity among the residents of the province’s six districts.
He emphasized the importance of celebrating this historic milestone with a spirit of togetherness and assured the public of a safe and peaceful event.
In his address, aim reflected on the significance of the anniversary as a time for both reflection and celebration.
“This is an opportunity for us to come together, honor our shared identity and embrace the rich cultural heritage that defines us as a province,” he stated.
He urged the community to set aside differences and unite as one people, encouraging everyone to uphold traditions that promote harmony and respect.
Baim was resolute in his assurance that the police force is fully prepared to support the celebrations across all districts.
“We are here to ensure that everyone can participate in the festivities with joy and safety,” he said. He emphasized that any attempts to disrupt the celebrations would be met with strict action.
Baim also highlighted the importance of remembering and respecting the contributions of the nation’s founding leaders, such as Grand Chief Sir Michael Thomas Somare, Sir Julius Chan, Sir Angmai Bilas, Sir Bato Bultin and many other great leaders. These leaders, he noted, have sacrificed greatly for the nation’s future.
“Let us come together to honor their legacy and celebrate the journey of our nation,” Baim concluded.

Defence Chief directs payroll cleanup,23/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3297,,Military,Trust,Nill,"Chief of Defence Force Rear Admiral Philip Polewara has directed for 110 names to be removed from the force’s payroll.
The names are of personnel who are on official records as AWOL (Absent without leave), deceased or discharged; but whose names are still on the PNGDF payroll and are still receiving fortnightly salaries from the government.
“Those names will be deleted from the system and payments effectively ceased,” Rear Admiral Polewara said.
This payroll anomaly came to light during the course of investigations into the PNGDF payroll; an exercise that has continued since last year following pay discrepancies experienced by members of the force.
Rear Admiral Polewara said more issues in the payroll would come to light and would be resolved as the work on the pay system progresses.
“Service Personnel Payroll is an important aspect of the force’s management that involves counterparts from the Public Service, especially the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance. Hence, PNGDF is working accordingly with the departments to ensure these matters are addressed,” Rear Admiral Polewara said.
“Other payroll issues identified during the course of the investigations will be addressed unit by unit through the commanding officers. Furthermore, should any member of the force be found intentionally allowing ghost names to be on the payroll, they will be severely dealt with.”
Meanwhile, the Chief of Defence Force stated that there will no longer be any re-enlistments.
“PNGDF will now strictly bring in personnel through the recruitment process and will no longer entertain re-enlistment of former members who expresses interest to come back,” he said.
“If directorates and units identify that there is a need for a specialist, they will follow due process so that PNGDF will write to the particular person offering a slot in the force.”
Rear Admiral Polewara said recruitment and personnel management was a focus area of the PNGDF because it was the process through which a quality defence force could be built on.
“I am very intentional in bringing in quality people and looking after them so that they can contribute to building a defence force that we as leaders dream of for a stronger future and a force our people deserve,” he said."

K12.5 Million Education Resource Center Nears Completion,22/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3296,,Education,Joy,Peter Numu,"The construction of a K12.5 million three-story education resource center in the Eastern Highlands Province is progressing well and is set for completion by mid-2025. This landmark project, funded by the Eastern Highlands Provincial Government, is expected to transform the delivery of education services in the province.
Last week, Eastern Highlands Provincial Education Director Wesley Albert led a team of senior education officers on their first visit to the site of the new complex. The officers, including Fay Kaimavo (OIC Salaries), Richard Fino (PEB Executive Officer), and Meroyn Sero (OIC EMIS), expressed their appreciation for the infrastructure, describing it as a game-changer for the province's education sector.
“For the first time, the Eastern Highlands Education Division will have its own dedicated building to house all education-related services under one roof,” said one senior officer. ""This is a tangible change in education service delivery, and we thank our director for his leadership.""
Since taking office in 2019, Wesley Albert has overseen numerous improvements in the education sector, including policy implementation, administrative reforms, and infrastructural development. The new education resource center stands as a testament to these advancements.
Director Albert highlighted that this will be the first education building of its kind, not only in Eastern Highlands but across the country.
""You will not see such a building in other provinces. Eastern Highlands is privileged to have this magnificent three-story complex, which will be a one-stop shop for all education services,"" Albert said.
The facility will house key education divisions, including school inspectors, salaries, appointments, TVET, elementary education, district education managers (DEMs), and other sections. Additionally, it will feature a provincial FORD office, an e-library, e-learning facilities, college and university centers, an internet café, ATMs, a cafeteria, and rental office spaces for SMEs.
""This building will not only improve education service delivery but also contribute to the province's internal revenue by leasing office spaces to local businesses,"" Albert added.
Albert extended his gratitude to former Provincial Governor Peter Numu for initiating the project and acknowledged the continuous support from current Governor Simon Sia. He also thanked Provincial Administrator Allan Los and his administration for ensuring the project's timely implementation.
Once completed, the building will be a significant landmark in the heart of Goroka. The state-of-the-art structure will be fitted with modern electronic systems and offer breathtaking views of the province. From the top floor, visitors will have a panoramic view of Goroka’s central business district, the airport runway to the south, and the bustling Goroka main market to the west."
Adventure Kokoda and TPA Clash Over Management Plans,22/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3295,,Business,Anger,Nill,"The Papua New Guinea Tourism Promotion Authority (TPA) and Adventure Kokoda’s Charlie Lyn are at odds over the future of tourism along the historic Kokoda Trail, following recent claims about governance and development projects.
Lyn, a long-time operator on the trail, has criticized TPA CEO Eric Mossman-Uvovo, accusing him of signing a ""suicide note"" for Kokoda tourism by supporting the establishment of the Kokoda Track Management Authority (KTMA). He alleges the proposal, drafted in Canberra during the COVID-19 pandemic, lacks proper consultation with local landowners and tour operators.
According to Lyn, shifting Kokoda’s management focus from tourism to environmental oversight will burden the industry with regulations that limit trek group sizes, reduce campsite availability, and restrict access to key areas. He argues this move will further harm Kokoda tourism, which has already seen a 42% decline since 2009, translating to millions in lost revenue for local communities.
TPA has strongly refuted these claims, stating that its recent Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with ABT Associates, signed at Owers Corner in early February, is part of a broader initiative to improve infrastructure and support tourism. The agreement, under the Kokoda Initiative Partnership (KIP), aims to build 190 new toilets at campsites and guesthouses along the trail, enhancing sanitary conditions for trekkers and benefiting local communities.
Mossman-Uvovo dismissed allegations of a “secretly drafted” KTMA proposal, emphasizing that TPA has engaged stakeholders through consultations. He clarified that the MOA does not transfer tourism oversight to environmental agencies but instead strengthens tourism-related businesses along the trail.
“The claim that PNG is ‘giving away’ the Kokoda Trail to foreign aid-funded influencers is misleading,” Mossman-Uvovo stated. “TPA remains committed to growing and protecting PNG’s tourism industry while ensuring sustainable development that benefits landowners and tour operators.”
TPA reassured the public and stakeholders that all tourism developments along the Kokoda Track are undertaken transparently and in line with PNG’s national tourism strategy. Mossman-Uvovo encouraged open dialogue, emphasizing that any future decisions regarding the trail will align with national interests.
As the debate continues, the future of the Kokoda Trail remains a critical issue, with both sides pushing for what they believe best serves the interests of PNG tourism and local communities."
ITI degree program of international standard,22/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3294,,Education,Trust,Nill,"Certified Practicing Accountants PNG (CPAPNG) recognizes International Training Institute as a school that can produce accountants of international standard. This was revealed during the launch of ITI’s Bachelor in Accounting and Finance program yesterday in Port Moresby.
Manager for Continued Professional Development Trainings and Branding with the Certified Practicing Accountants, John Varey, said that the capacity of higher education to accommodate the growing needs and population of students remains a significant challenge for the country.
Over 70,000 students graduate from secondary schools in PNG and only 12 percent of these students’ secure space in tertiary institutions.
“This is where private institutions like ITI have been exceptional in addressing this gap and making substantial contribution to nation building.
“This is a testament to the program's quality and its alignment with global accounting education standards. CPA has been admitted to International Federation of accountant that's a global body based in New York, they set the standards for the global accounting fraternity to adopt.”
Varey also shared the CPA’s Executive Director, Yuwak Tau’s reaction to ITI’s degree program.
“When the proposed scope for Bachelor of Accounting and Finance program was presented for review, Mr Yuwak Tau, our executive director, was extremely pleased to see that the program not only met, but exceeded the standards set by International Federation of Accountants Education Board.”"
Mendi-Munihu DDA Ends Tertiary School Fee Assistance,22/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3292,,Local,Anger,Raphael Tonpi,"The Mendi-Munihu District Development Authority (MMDDA) has officially announced that it will no longer provide school fee assistance for students attending tertiary institutions in the 2025 academic year. The decision, made during a recent meeting, aims to shift the district’s focus toward improving basic education infrastructure.
Local MP and Vice Minister for State-Owned Enterprises, Raphael Tonpi, defended the move, stating that while he sympathizes with struggling parents, the district cannot continue funding tertiary students due to financial constraints.
He explained that MMDDA’s priority is to rehabilitate schools, construct new classrooms, staff housing, and administrative buildings, as well as expanding education access in remote areas. So far, the district has successfully established 16 new primary schools and seven new high schools.
Tonpi highlighted that the cost of supporting tertiary students is unsustainable, as it could consume up to 50% of the District Services Improvement Program (DSIP) funds, affecting other development projects. He reminded parents that the government has already provided 12 years of free education from elementary to Grade 12 and urged them to take personal responsibility for their children’s higher education.
He also criticized the tendency of some parents to spend money on non-essential customary obligations, such as compensation, gambling, and ceremonies, instead of prioritizing education. ""We should be competing in paying school fees, not spending on unnecessary things for status and fame,"" he said.
Tonpi called on parents to start financial planning early and avoid last-minute struggles when their children are selected for tertiary education. ""This is a tough but genuine call. Parents must take ownership of their children's education and prepare for school fees instead of waiting for government assistance,"" he emphasized.
With this decision, MMDDA aims to create long-term improvements in the district’s education system, ensuring that future generations have access to quality learning facilities."
Mendi-Munihu Builds Four Health Posts,22/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3291,,Health,Trust,Raphael Tonpi,"Four new Community Health Posts are under construction in the Mendi-Munihu District of Southern Highlands Province, aiming to improve healthcare access for rural communities.
The health posts - Tukup, Tupip, Nol, and Melant, are part of a broader initiative by the Mendi-Munihu District Development Authority (MMDDA) in partnership with the Southern Highlands Provincial Health Authority (SHPHA).
Member for Mendi-Munihu, Raphael Tonpi, emphasized the need for accessible healthcare, particularly for pregnant mothers.
“Our district has experienced maternal deaths because these facilities aren’t available. That’s why we’ve provided each health centre with an ambulance, an ambulance shed, and a maternity ward,” he said.
Mr. Tonpi, who is also the Vice Minister for State-Owned Enterprises, assured that local companies are contracted for the projects under SHPHA’s technical supervision to meet healthcare standards.
Additionally, K500,000 has been allocated for upgrading Munhiu Health Centre, while the Kip United Church Hospital project is set for tendering soon.
“Small things matter. Try your best to stay healthy, but if you fall sick, it’s our responsibility to provide the health services you need,” Mr. Tonpi stated."

"Police shoot, wound and lose wanted criminal in a day",22/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3289,,Crime,Frustration,Nill,"In a dramatic turn of events in Madang, a police operation aimed at capturing a notorious criminal concluded in disappointment after he was captured but escaped custody the same day.
The 24-year-old Yaks Linus Wanamari, originally from Manjuat village in East Sepik was involved in a confrontation with law enforcement officers early Monday morning.
The sequence of events happened when the Trans-Crime Unit and the National Criminal Intelligence Unit alerted the police about Wanamari’s violent intentions. Armed with a homemade firearm, he attempted to commit arson and murder a person, a resident of the RD Cannery Ltd backyard settlement. The victim and his daughter reported the threat to the police.
Upon receiving the report, police officers promptly arrived at the scene. Wanamari, however, fled into nearby bushes, prompting a pursuit.
Madang Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim, confirmed that Wanamari was shot during the chase after he resisted arrest and brandished his weapon at the officers. The injured Wanamari was captured and transported to Modilon General Hospital for medical treatment.
While undergoing treatment for gunshot wounds to his leg in the hospital’s emergency ward, Wanamari managed to escape, adding another layer of complexity to the already tense situation.
“Despite his injuries, Wanamari managed to flee the hospital. We are continuing our search for him and urge the public to remain vigilant and report any sightings,” PPC Baim reported.
Wanamari’s criminal record is extensive and concerning, with charges that include wilful murder, arson, armed robbery, rape, attempted murder and manslaughter. His known hangouts include the RD Cannery Ltd settlement in Madang province and Bumbu Wara Market in Lae, Morobe province, making these areas focal points of the ongoing search efforts.
The police have intensified their operations to recapture Wanamari, urging anyone with information about his whereabouts to come forward.
“We will not rest until we locate you, including those who harbor criminal elements. Let me assure you, the law will catch up with you, and you will regret going against it. This applies to everyone for our collective safety, so be warned. My policemen will not tolerate such criminal activity in Madang. We will weed you out,” warned PPC Baim.
The incident highlights the urgent need for community cooperation in law enforcement efforts and the dedication of the police force to maintaining safety and order despite the challenges they face. The search for Wanamari continues, with authorities committed to bringing him to justice and ensuring the safety of the public."

The full course program will commence in 2026.
ITI Chairman and Co-founder, Senthil Kumaran Sentheyval shared that this is a big milestone for the school from when they began.
“This was a dream for us to have a degree. I mean, we had lot of challenges throughout the last 25-26 years as being a private institution, it was not easy. There's lot of challenges towards us, because people don't realize how important private disciplines are for any country. And so we had to come through many challenges to be where we are now, but we have proven that private sector can also assist in educating as well.”
The degree program will run for four years and is scheduled to commence in 2026. Requirements for this program will include a GPA of 2.2 or above and options are available for Diploma in Accounting graduates to advance to the degree course but must possess a GPA of 2.0. This applies to those also intending to take the advanced Diploma in Accounting program as well.

“We have to do eight modules which are of international standard, two semesters in a year. After they complete, they are then certified as CPA, so as a peak professional accounting body in Papua New Guinea, CPA PNG is proud to continue its partnership with ITI and we look forward to collaborating with you as you shape the future of accounting, education and nurture the next generation of professionals.”

Madang gets GTFS school supplies,21/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3278,,Education,Anticipation,Nill,"Schools in Madang are picking school supplies for the academic year at the Marape Hall at Tusbab Secondary School.
The stationary, which arrived last October, were purchased as per the Government Tuition Fee Subsidy (GTFS) policy.
They are mostly teaching and learning materials.
Tusbab Secondary Deputy Principal Administration, Michael Kavagu, has put a call out to schools who have yet to collect their supplies, to do so immediately to free up the Marape Hall for school activities.
Mr. Kavagu said of the six districts, schools in Middle Ramu and Rai Coast have yet to move their supplies out.
Meantime, Tusbab Secondary is faced with enrolment challenges, particularly finding space for transfer-in students. This week, the school grounds was overcrowded as students and parents came in numbers to see if they made the acceptance list. Mr Kavagu said police had to be called in to calm anxious and disgruntled parents.
According to the town mayor, Peter Yalsy, the government has imposed its ‘Leave no child behind’ policy and they would like to help as many students and parents as possible. He said many parents want their child to attend Tusbab Secondary.
Tusbab Secondary recently opened two additional grade nine classrooms. Besides building more classroom infrastructure, the school has put to the government to upgrade primary schools like Holy Spirit Primary, Lutheran Day Primary or Kusbau Primary School to junior high schools, to alleviate overcrowding challenges."

Maladina to seek legal clarification on Ministerial Determination,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3262,,Government,Trust,Jimmy Maladina,"Minister for Petroleum Jimmy Maladina in a press conference today announced the Government’s intention to file a Supreme Court reference to seek legal clarification regarding the implementation of the Ministerial Determination related to Petroleum Development License (PDL) 2.
This move aims to guide whether the beneficiaries from the Kutubu region are recognized under the provisions of the Oil and Gas Act.
By initiating this legal process, Maladina intends to ensure that the rights and interests of the landowners affected by the Ministerial Determination are upheld.
He has extended an invitation to both factions of the impacted landowner groups to participate in the proceedings, emphasizing the importance of their input in the legal deliberation.
Maladina said this collaborative approach aims to foster unity among the stakeholders and ensure that all voices are heard in the legal process.
“Our meetings this week with both parties have been very positive and encouraging. l appreciates the willingness of all sides to engage in open discussions, and I commend their respective leadership for their constructive approach,” Maladina stated.
Notwithstanding this legal step, Minister Maladina remains hopeful that a resolution can be reached through dialogue, without requiring the Court's intervention.
He further emphasized that, while discussions continue, landowners have now agreed to withdraw their ultimatum to the State as all parties work towards a lasting resolution within the confines of law and equity.
“The aggrieved landowners have shown good faith by withdrawing their ultimatum, and we will continue to work together to reach a fair and legally sound outcome.”
He further highlighted that, despite some disagreements, there are promising areas of agreement that can be built upon in the coming days and weeks to find a sustainable resolution.
Maladina reaffirmed his commitment to working closely with all parties to bring certainty to the benefit-sharing arrangements for PDL 2, stating that a mutually agreed solution remains the best possible outcome.
Meantime, the Chairman of Namo Aporo Landowner Association, John Kapi Nato and Foe Landowner Association have pledged to work with the Government and solve this issue amicably."
Unemployment causes crime,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3263,,Society,Sadness,Nill,"Unemployment is causing an increase in crime rates and the vagrancy Act is not the solution.
Chairman for National Research Institute, Wilson Thompson thinks that an increase in employment will decrease crime rates in the country.
“What we really need is to increase our outputs in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries space, so that creates the employment. We are talking about the crime in the city and all these problems, what we are seeing is that these people that are in Port Moresby, have been attracted and they're still going into Port Moresby. If you look at the highlands, not many Cocoa plantations are in operation. If you go down to the coast, there's no coconut plantations or rubber plantations, everyone is going into the towns and cities. What we need to do is create employment opportunities back in the rural areas.”
In welcoming the Government’s policy in the education sector where more education opportunities have bene made available for youths, he also thinks that more need to be done.
“The government has done fine in terms of education, creating free education, providing spaces. At the top, everyone is passing through. We have 8000 University spaces available, we've got about 30 or 40,000 in vocational centers or TVET centers, 10,000 in technical colleges, another 3000 in the teachers’ colleges, and everyone is going in there, and what will happen when they come out? where are they going to go? And yet, we are still creating more spaces for education and training. We are continuing to doing that, but we are not creating the opportunities for employment.”
He said the only way people can be taken off the streets is to increase income opportunities in the rural areas, by building factories in the poultry, livestock, forestry, agriculture and fisheries sectors.
Furthermore, Thompson said the Vagrancy Act that members of parliament and the public are stressing on is not the solution to a decrease in crime rates.
He said many who have lived their lives in the city have no place to go back home to , and if so people who have already voted for their members in parliament in the city and are registered in the electoral roll book will fight for their rights.
He said the only way is to create employment and income opportunities in the rural areas to allure people back to their homelands."
Industrial engagement way forward for inmates,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3273,,Government,Trust,Joe Kuli,"Developing productive industries within the PNG Correctional Services could help reduce costs and contribute to local economic development, says Prime Minister Marape.
He was speaking during his address to the CS PNG Correctional Services in Port Moresby on Sunday 16th February 2025. The event was attended by the Acting Correctional Services Commissioner, Bernard Nepo, Minister for CS, Joe Kuli, and other senior members and staff of the CS.
Marape expressed that if prison labour is integrated into productive industries, the labour cost will be much lower.
“Instead of idly sitting, inmates can be training in industries that will help them reintegrate into society, while also reducing costs for the state,” he explained.
Meanwhile, Acting Correctional Services Commissioner, Bernard Nepo said CS already has rehabilitation programmes for the inmates including industrial skills, with the full support of the government.
“We have existing prison industries right around the country, taking a communal approach, but having given the support by the government, what we’ll do is maximize all the prison industries and we will try to commercialize them.
“The prisoners who are rehabilitated will be put in those industries, they will work in those industries, and if we generate enough money, at least they have some money in their account, and so when they are released, they’ll go out with the skills, with the tools that we’ll issue and them with their certificates,” Nepo said.
He said they will be partnering with institutions like Mapex, with whom they had already established talks leading soon to the signing of a MoU with the education department to pave the way for better plans for TVET programmes.
Further in his call, Prime Minister Marape urged the PNGCS leadership to think beyond short-term operations and work towards a transformative correctional system that will define PNG’s future by 2045.
Nepo said he is determined to secure funding so they will be able to put up extra classrooms for the training to eventuate, if not this year, then next year.
Prime Minister Marape also affirmed the government’s commitment to invest in correctional services, security, and rehabilitation programmes, ensuring that PNGCS is not just a detention facility but a key contributor to PNG’s development."
Gov’t support CS rehabilitation,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3271,,Government,Trust,"James Marape, Joe Kuli","PNG Correctional Services has been commended by Prime Minister James Marape for being the most disciplined force among the country’s security agencies while challenging its leadership to elevate its role in nation-building and rehabilitation.
Marape outlined an ambitious 20-year vision for PNGCS, emphasizing discipline, rehabilitation, and economic contribution through vocational training.
Acting Correctional Services Commissioner, Bernard Nepo who was present with the Minister for CS Joe Kuli and other senior officers of CS and staff, received the commendation from the Prime Minister on Sunday 16th positively.
PM Marape had said the CS is not just about imprisonment; it is about correction and rehabilitation.
“Prison is a place where we have to have a positive outlook for people who are brought into our custody. So Prime Minister was expressing concern for how we can able to address the needs of prisoners, especially upskilling them, and so when they are released they can be able to contribute meaningfully.” Acting Commissioner Nepo said.
In reaffirming the PM’s commitment, A/Commissioner Nepo said the CS is now set to go, as under his leadership TVET programmes have already been rolled out under the rehabilitation programme within the prison.
“Previously it has been operating on a haddock basis, and so given the support by the current Marape-Rosso government we are now pursuing it aggressively so that the programmes will be replicated to the rest of the country,” said Nepo.
Nepo said the CS will be signing an MoU with the Education Department, for the TVET programmes, which in a few weeks, the PM will officiate at a ceremony so that it will pave the way for many positive things to come from the prison service.
He assures the public as well as key stakeholders that this programme will be done through the government’s triple ‘P’ policy; the Public Private Partnership. There will be community engagement through the churches, the education department, and the correctional service working as a team to get these projects to work throughout the country."

13 arrested for Popondetta robbery,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3270,,Local,Trust,Gary Juffa,"Popondetta police have so far apprehended about 13 suspects who were involved in the recent robbery in Popondetta Town.
Oro Provincial Police Commander Ewai Segi confirmed this. He said police are currently processing the suspects.
The Oro Provincial Government commended the police for their swift and successful operation in apprehending the suspects.
Oro Governor Gary Juffa reiterated the province’s firm stance against crime, stating that such lawless behaviour will not be tolerated. As part of the immediate response, the Governor has directed the provincial administration to proceed with the eviction of illegal settlers residing on government-owned land, which has long been a source of criminal activity in the province.
“The Oro Provincial Government has been working tirelessly to strengthen law enforcement, with a composite team from Southern Command stationed in the province for over a year and a half,” said Governor Juffa. “We will continue to maintain this team while building our police capacity, but we need urgent support from the national government.”
Governor Juffa emphasized the challenges faced by local law enforcement, particularly the insufficient resources allocated to provinces to combat rising crime rates.
“Our policemen and women are outnumbered and exhausted as they face increasing law and order challenges. The national government must take serious action to improve infrastructure, provide necessary funding, and address police welfare,” he said. “Provinces should be given block grants to deal with law and order issues effectively.
Simply cautioning, making recommendations, or discussing plans is not enough. We need immediate and tangible action to combat crime.”
The Oro Provincial Government urges the national government to take stock of the deteriorating law and order situation across the country and implement real, effective measures to restore safety and security for all citizens."
K30mil overhaul of Lae stadium,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3264,,Sports,Anticipation,"Don Polye, John Rosso","Approximately K30 million is allocated for the complete overhaul of the rundown Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium in Lae, Morobe Province.
Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, said they aim to complete the first phase of the upgrade and open the sporting facilities to the public on September 16th; PNG’s 50th Independence anniversary.
The Sir Ignatius Kilage Stadium was built for the 1991 South Pacific Games. Like other infrastructure in the country, it was left to deteriorate with betelnut-stained walls and floors, a badly damaged synthetic track, and worn-out and ill-equipped gyms.
Under the leadership of Lae MP, John Rosso, the Lae City Authority took over the stadium’s management through the signing of a lease agreement on Tuesday, the 3rd of October, 2023.
Rosso emphasised that the residents of Lae need to enjoy well-maintained facilities, that was why the conversation was initiated with the then Sports Minister, Don Polye, and the Sports Foundation, to let the LCA manage and maintain the stadium.
“The current stadium has been rundown for a long, long time,” outlined Rosso.
“It was under the National Sports Foundation but no attention had been given to it and it sits in the middle of Lae with a lot of people utilising it. It got to a point where the tracks were getting dangerous.”
Once upgraded, LCA anticipates opening up the facilities to host domestic and national events.
“So, the schedule for the completion of the first part of the stadium will be scheduled for September when we go into the 50th Independence anniversary. So, I’d like to give that as a present – a newly-renovated stadium – to the people of Lae.”
LCA now manages the entire indoor and outdoor stadium facilities including the netball and volleyball courts next to the Lae Rugby League ground.
This is all part of the Lae MP’s plan to restore Lae to the days when families enjoyed a peaceful and safer city."

Keeping the Kangal alive,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3256,,Culture,Anticipation,Nill,"Papua New Guinea is truly a unique country blessed with diverse cultures and traditions. This diversity differentiates each province, district and even the smallest of groups like villages, especially in local vernaculars and dialects. There is so much more to learn about the significance and historic value of each culture and tradition.
We zero in on the Rai Coast District, which recently observed the 16th annual festival of the significant Kangal Headdress, worn only by men. The Kangal Festival united five village communities, who speak different dialects but are connected by the Kangal ritual and dance. It performed to signify the transition of a boy into manhood and his role in the society. It takes years to master a synchronized Kangal performance in accordance with its intricate designs and exclusive paintings and dance moves. Soge Dilambe, Ward 6 Councilor and Founder Kangal Festival explains.
“Bifo long ol grup kam, man bai (statim) singsing nau Kangal lain bai kam insait long ples blong singsing. Ol lain ba laitim bombom na apim so ol ken lukim bilas blong em, hau em paint na kam.”
(Before the dancing group enters the arena, one man will start the chanting. He will also light up dried coconut leaves to signal the Kangal performers and also identify the paint on the Kangal headdress.)
The Kangal moves into the arena as unique dance moves are performed. The notorious Finisterre range shares a border with the Sarawagec range in Morobe province. The people in this region carry the Kangal culture.
“Igat Madang, na mipla tok igat Morobe. Wanem samting kamap long namel em olsem as blong Kundu long hap (points to Morobe), lip blong em lo hia (points to his feet), Garamut long hap (points to Madang), lip blong em long hia (points to his feet). Tupla diwai i stap olsem.
(The roots of the kundu is in Morobe, its leaves are in Bandit. The garamut’s is in Madang, its leaves are in Bandit. The culture is with me in the middle.)
As sacred as their dances are, the Kangal culture practicing groups are not allowed to call out its name in public for fear of being cursed or inviting misfortune in their lives.
“Em spirit yah, nogut mi tokaut na bai mi sik o kain osem. O yu lukim na bai yu sik o… yu meri, yu nonap lukim hau ol karim Kangal. Em tambu. Singsing long nait, em yu harim stori tasol. Blong morning, em san so bai yu lukim ol bilas tasol.”
(It’s a spiritual being. If I call out its name, I could get sick, or if (women) see it, you might get sick. The performance at night is not supposed to be seen. In the morning, (women) will only see the traditional decorations used during the rituals and dance.)
Red and black dances are performed either under the cover of darkness to dawn, and during the day. Dilambe says each performance is strictly times. He would very much like to share this with the world.
“Igat kainkain kala blong Kangal. Wanpla misla sa tok Duangnu, em longpla. Narapla mipla tok bilak singsing, bai yu lukim olsem ambrela. Em blong nait. Narapla em Dama, narapla em mipla kolim Bangian.”
(The Kangal headdress comes in various colours and designs. One called Duangnu is long. Another, which is part of the Black dance, is umbrella-shaped and is performed only at night. One other is called Dama and another called Bangian.)
Before becoming the Ward 6 Councilor, Dilambe had the foresight of making their culture and tradition a way forward for his people to benefit sustainably, instead of bringing in logging or mining. The mission to his vision began in 2003 when he approached former Madang Visitors and Cultural Bureau director, Taba Silau. Mr. Silau gave him directions on how to create traditional groups and have them registered for events.
In 2008, after all procedures and protocols came into place, the Kangal Festival was birthed and in 2022 it was included in the National Cultural Commission (NCC) calendar of events. In 2024 the 16th Kangal Festival was held.
The festival’s museum is in Bandit village. The museum holds all cultural items from the five Kangal performing wards. In this museum, only men are allowed inside. Females are not allowed to enter because the cultural centre is also an initiation site for young boys to transition into men; ready to carry the Kangal.
The first day of the 16th Kangal Festival was hosted in Umboldi. Day two continued at Saidor Station. Villagers left Umboldi for Saidor - a six-hour walk that included scaling steep mountains in the chilly air, and a few dips in the cool pristine mountain creeks.
The dawn dance in Saidor, kicked off at midnight and concluded at 7am to begin the second day of the festival. These were sacred dances not meant for display under light. An exception was made for the media.
The dance by the Gwarawon group from Nayudo LLG was the highlight. They performed the black dance without the Kangal as it was their first time to participate in a Kangal ritual and dance. Group leader, Nai Dongkine, explained that once they start this performance, the singing does not stop until the break of dawn. The song they performed was a fusion of voices in different tones. They sing about many values and tie it to initiation, marriage, customary obligations and death.
Dongkine said, “Displa singsing long tokples mipla kolim long Kongkap. Em minim olsem singsing blong tewel man. Displa singsing em no wankain osem red singsing we man na meri tromoi lek na singsing wantem. Ol man tasol save singsing. Nau ol man i pasim disla (singsing), ol fit lo marit na lukautim (femli). Em bilip blo mipla.
(We call this song ‘Kongkap’ in our language. It is a song for the evil spirit and only men sing it. Unlike the red songs where women can dance with men. Men who perform the black dance, they are fit to marry and have a family. That is our belief.)
“Neks yia bai mipla kam, kisim ol ambrela singsing na sanampim Kangal.
(Next year we will come to the festival with the umbrella Kangal and perform.)
“Man i sa stap hait tasol na bai yu harim nek tasol blo disla singsing. Nau tasol ol kam ples kilia. Bifo taim em ol stap lo hausman tasol na ol meri bai go na givim kaikai long ol tewel man yah.
(In the past, man would be in the cover of the man’s house and you would only hear their voices singing the Kongkap. Women would bring food to the evil spirit to which the song is for.
“Sapos yu save osem ol twentipla man, em yu harim twentipla nek. Olgeta wanwan blong ol igat nek blong ol yet ol save yusim long singsing. Sapos wanpla idai, na mipla planim em, bai mipla mas singsing long nek blong em.
(If you knew 20 men were part of the singsing group, exactly 20 voices would be singing the song. Every single one has a tune they sing to. If one of them dies, we would sing at his burial, in the tune that he sang to while alive.)
“Nau yet em tetipla nek yet ol singsing na long own nek blong ol. Niupla man bai yu faul. Tasol long mipla, mipla ken stap longwe, but sapos mipla harim nek blong wanpla, mi save husait i kam pinis long ples blong singsing.
(Right now, 30 men are in this singing group and they are singing to 30 different tunes. For someone new to this, they will not be able to tell who is singsing and to what tune. For the trained ears, we can be far away from the singing group, but we can tell who just joined the singing group by the tune that he is singing to.)
Council Dilambe longs to see tourists berth on their shores to witness the Kangal festival. He acknowledges that there is so much yet to accomplish in terms of infrastructure and hospitality services for visitors. This keeps him determined to pursue his tourism dreams."
‘Who will be next?’,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3265,,Local,Fear,Nill,"The once peaceful East New Britain is becoming more and more unsafe for especially women and girls.
Rabaul resident and women’s advocate, Susie McGrade, expressed alarm at the spiralling law and order situation following the slashing of a Filipino woman on Sunday, February 16th, in Hot Rooster.
“Women are being slashed every day and we fear the next robbery won't just be bilum stealing and slashing on the way out. It will be rape,” she said.
“I’m third generation Rabaul. My (Scottish) grandparents who were here before World War II are buried here.
“I have spent pretty much my whole life here and I feel more Rabaul than anything else, and I have never felt so afraid in my life before,” expressed McGrade, who was one of the few expatriates who never left Rabaul during the 1994 twin volcanic eruptions.
“We need better police management and we want more police presence in urban areas, not at the police station but patrolling the streets.
“As a matter of urgency, we need radios on every police officer and in police vehicles.
“We want beanies or head coverings banned. We want loitering enforced. Mobs of youths, walking around, preying on women, need to be investigated or broken up.
“We women feel totally vulnerable and let down by the police. Whilst we have some police we respect and help us, we feel police management from the top is poor.
“Every woman in ENB is frightened. Who will be next?”
McGrade called for management and enforcement, saying island tourism has been obliterated because tourists do not feel safe anymore.
“Carnival cruise ships have pulled out of Rabaul.

Madang gets new single police barracks,19/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3254,,Government,Trust,Ramsey Pariwa,"A new barracks for single police officers was officially commissioned at the DCA area in ward eight of Madang urban local level government recently.
Commissioned on Thursday 13th February, the 10-men single units was constructed by AR Pacific Limited at a portion of land situated near its company yard in DCA, a notorious area known for criminal activities over the years.
Governor, Ramsey Pariwa who opened the barracks said for far too long, Madang has been in the spotlight and received name tags such as the ‘Murder Capital’ of the country. Law and order issues were a rife in the province from petty crimes to heinous murders.
He said the government has now been empowering police force to effectively counter law and order issues by implementing and supporting Community Policing Units in crime hot spot areas, increasing manpower, providing resources and infrastructures and now the opening of the barracks.
Governor Pariwa said that combating law and order in the province needed collective efforts not only from the government but also through public-private partnership.
“Law and order is everyone’s business. Law and order em stap long finger blong mipla, em stat long haus na kam. We as citizens create law and order issues. If we all say NO to law and order, there will not be any problems in the community. Fighting Law and order is not only police responsibility nor the leaders’ but everyone’s responsibility,” Governor Pariwa said.

PM maintains support for judicial reforms,19/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3252,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has commended the justice sector’s efforts in strengthening the rule of law and advancing critical legal reforms over the past six years.
He reaffirmed the independence of the judiciary and continued reform in a recent meeting with Department of Justice and Attorney-General (DJAG) Secretary Dr Eric Kwa and other agency heads.
“The country exists because of the rule of law,” Prime Minister Marape stated. “Without it, we lose the foundation of our democracy and governance. The independence and functionality of our judiciary are paramount, and my government will continue to support efforts that uphold justice and strengthen the rule of law.”
Prime Minister Marape highlighted the need for continued reforms to bolster judicial processes, improve case management, and enhance the efficiency of the courts.
“Our courts must function without interference, and we must provide them with the necessary resources to ensure that justice is dispensed fairly and without delay,” he said.
Marape highlighted the importance of recruiting and retaining top legal minds, financial experts, and governance professionals for a robust and effective justice system.
He stressed on the need for digital transformation in the judiciary to improve efficiency, accessibility, and transparency.
“We need to modernise case management, streamline legal procedures, and leverage technology to improve service delivery. Delayed justice is denied justice.”
Housing and resource allocation for legal professionals were also recognized as a key priority in ensuring a strong judiciary, noting that a proper accommodation, competitive salaries, and better working conditions are necessary to attract and retain top-tier legal professionals.
“To have a competent and effective justice system, we must invest in our legal professionals. From salaries to housing and work resources, we must create an environment where the best legal minds can thrive and contribute meaningfully to our nation,” he said."
Numbalihi family call for action,19/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3251,,Society,Anger,Nill,"It has been a week since the passing of Lyna Numbalihi, a mother of two who was brutally murdered by her partner, a member of the PNG Defence Force.
With no progress update from the PNGDF, the family of late Lyna is calling on the force to come out clear and explain why it has taken long to apprehend the suspect.
“Your Men’s failure to act decisively and transparently in the pursuit of justice for Lyna raises serious concerns about the PNGDF's commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights and dignity of all citizens, including women and vulnerable people.
“The lack of progress by PNGDF in this case for over a week suggests negligence and complicity in aiding and abetting the perpetrator to evade justice. Such inaction is unacceptable and undermines public trust in the PNGDF as an institution tasked with safeguarding the nation and its people,” said Emmanuel Numbalihi.
In a letter to the PNGDF, Numbalihi demanded the following;
1. Immediate Arrest and Prosecution of the Perpetrator:
The PNGDF must take immediate and decisive action to locate, apprehend and hand over the perpetrator to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. Justice must be served without further delay to demonstrate that no one is above the law, regardless of their affiliation with the Defence Force;
2. Full Cooperation with Investigations:
The PNGDF must cooperate fully with law enforcement agencies and provide all necessary resources, eyewitness information and evidence and access (into the crime scene) to ensure a thorough and impartial investigation into this crime is carried out;
3. Compensation and Support for the Family:
The PNGDF must take responsibility for its role in this tragedy and provide financial assistance to the family of late Lyna to cover the costs of her funeral, repatriation and burial. As the wife of a serving member of the Defence Force, Lyna was part of the PNGDF family and it is the moral obligation of the institution to support her grieving family during this difficult time;
4. Public Accountability and Transparency:
The PNGDF must issue a public statement acknowledging its failure to protect Lyna and outlining the steps it is taking to ensure such a tragedy does not occur again. Transparency in this process is crucial to restoring public confidence in the Defence Force.
Meanwhile, Numbalihi said the brutal murder of Lyna is a stark reminder of the persistent issue of gender-based violence in society.
Since the death of Lyna, PNGDF has issued a statement, promising the family that a manhunt is on foot to apprehend the suspect. The force will ensure that he faces the full force of law when apprehended."

The PNG Road Fund opened its second office at the Nadzab Tomodachi International Airport on Friday, February 14th.
Chairman of the road fund and Secretary for Finance, Samuel Penias, emphasised the importance of servicing an area that would contribute to the economic growth of this country.
The Lae office will focus on the Highlands Highway, the Ramu-Madang Road as well as the proposed Trans-National Highway that will be connecting Morobe Province to Port Moresby.
Similar sentiments were expressed by Works Secretary, Gibson Olemba, who outlined that “we are good at building roads, but we are not good at taking care of them”. This is why the PNG Road Fund was established; to maintain the national road network.
“The major network of our country is here in Lae because of the three national highways connected here; Ramu Highway, the main Highlands Highway – which is from Lae all the way to Kopiago; it connects the entire resource areas up in the Highlands region, including our Wau-Bulolo. And we’re currently reconstructing the Trans-National Highway.
“Having established the Road Fund office here is very strategic so we can raise funds to run road maintenance works across the country.
“We have almost 9,000km of national highway network which is currently funded through the Road Fund. And I’m thankful that the board has given us K25 million last year. We have started the road maintenance works, if you see from Two-Mile coming in to Yalu.”
Furthermore, as part of the road maintenance efforts, weighbridges will be established to collect fees, with Olemba stressing that most of the damaged pavements are caused by overloaded heavy vehicles.
The PNG Road Fund, established under the Road (Management and Fund) Act, 2020, is responsible for the collection, disbursement and monitoring of funds to maintain and upgrade the national road network."

Lavongai ‘maimai’ appeals for respect,18/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3230,,Local,Fear,Nill,"Mainland Kavieng has experienced an influx of people from Lavongai due to continuous fighting there.
With no police presence on New Hanover Island (Lavongai), in New Ireland Province, and no network coverage, petty crime has been allowed to fester over the years, leading to lawlessness.
The situation is similar on the mainland, with the arrival of Lavongai islanders over the years – including those from Mussau – adding on to the already stretched police manpower in the province.
Today, the people of Lavongai and Tigak have joined a peaceful protest around Kavieng town, led by the staff of the Kavieng Provincial Hospital. This follows two separate attacks on health workers by armed thugs from the nearby Pawa Haus settlement.
A ‘maimai’ (chief) from Lavongai, John Aini, is appealing to his people to respect and protect health workers, as a large number of Lavongais have resettled in the Pawa Haus settlement.
“Where will you go if you hurt health workers? Where can a pregnant mother go to, to access services, or where will you go if you’re sick?” Aini asked.
“If there are Lavongai people here who are breaking the law and causing disharmony, simply apprehend them and take them to the police.
“I’m tired of talking to Lavongais who have fled from the fighting, have resettled here, and are disturbing our peace.”
The New Hanover Island is two hours away from the mainland by boat. In 2024, fighting erupted between families in January, and continued unhindered for seven more months. Permanent houses were razed to the ground, two people were killed, many more injured and a large number of families were displaced.
Some of the displaced families moved further inland, into the bushes, while the rest made the 2-hour journey to Kavieng town and lived wherever they could."

“The conference focuses on international diplomacy, it highlights negotiations, passing resolutions, and communicating at the highest level. Our students were given the task of representing different countries. They had to do their research on those countries and present policy issues, debate on it, lobby and pass those resolutions.
“The students were exposed to the highest level of international diplomacy but as a student, I believe that will give them the confidence to their education later on in the future,” Kapak said.
Former student Sydell Mandau thanked Paradise College for the opportunity that has opened his eyes to see a lot of things and gain a lot of experience that he intends to contribute to the growth and development of PNG.
“I have learned a lot of skills such as public speaking, critical thinking, writing skills, and being able to articulate my English and also problem-solving and research,” Mandau said.
Meanwhile, the representation of the students for the first time has set a foundation for the school to participate in the conference next year."
Recent attacks renew vagrancy debate,18/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3225,,Politics,Anticipation,"Julius Chan, Powes Parkop, Sir Julius Chan","The late Sir Julius Chan had foreseen the issues that would happen in the absence of a vagrancy act.
This was why, during the 2025 budget deliberation on December 16th, 2024, more focus was placed on implementing the vagrancy act.
Prominent New Irelander and director of the Paradise Private Hospital, Janet Sios, alluded to that in light of the recent attacks on health workers at nearby Kavieng settlements.
“If you are in New Ireland, but you have no purpose to be there, if you’re following relatives, there’s no need for you to be there,” she said.
“Go back to where you came from and contribute towards your people. You don’t go and cause disharmony amongst the people of New Ireland and some of the coastal villages that are very peaceful people.
“I applaud our late governor for the initiative he had taken to implement that and I think NCD Governor, Powes Parkop, is also pushing for it.
“We really need it.”
The New Ireland provincial law and order committee has passed a resolution to evict settlers at Pawa Haus settlement. However, the enforcement of this decision is now with the provincial administration and police.
At the national level, the vagrancy act is currently in Parliament and will be on the agenda when Parliament resumes in March.

"Marape Condemns Crime in Baruni, supports eviction",16/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3209,,Politics,Anger,"James Marape, Powes Parkop","Prime Minister James Marape has condemned in the strongest terms the brutal rape and murder of a woman at Watermark Estate in Baruni, Port Moresby, describing the act as “inhumane, barbaric, and utterly unacceptable in our society.”
The Prime Minister assured the nation that the government will spare no effort in ensuring that those responsible for this heinous act are swiftly brought to justice.
In a statement released this afternoon, PM Marape stated, “I am deeply shocked and outraged by this despicable crime. No woman, no child, and no citizen of this country should ever have to endure such horrifying violence. This is not just an attack on one individual; it is an attack on our collective sense of humanity and justice.”
“I have instructed our law enforcement agencies to leave no stone unturned in their investigations. The criminals responsible for this cowardly act must be caught and punished to the fullest extent of the law. Justice must be served, and I urge all citizens with any information to come forward and assist the police,” he added.
Prime Minister Marape also reiterated his government’s unwavering support for the eviction of illegal settlements that have become safe havens for criminals. He commended the National Capital District Commission for its ongoing efforts to dismantle these settlements, emphasising that law and order must be upheld in all communities.
“For too long, certain areas have become breeding grounds for criminal elements who terrorise innocent people, businesses, and communities. This must stop. I fully support the efforts by Governor Powes Parkop and the NCDC authorities to remove illegal settlements that harbor criminal activities. We cannot allow law-abiding citizens and businesses to live in fear,” the Prime Minister said.
He stressed that evictions will be carried out in an orderly and lawful manner, with government agencies ensuring that those displaced are given proper support to relocate to designated areas.
The Prime Minister issued a strong and direct warning to those involved in this crime and all other criminal
activities in the country. “To those who commit such horrendous acts, let this be clear: the government will come down hard on you. We will not allow criminals to think they can act with impunity. The rule of law will prevail, and every perpetrator will face the full force of justice. My government is strengthening our police force, improving our justice system, and enhancing national security to ensure that such crimes are dealt with swiftly and decisively.”
Prime Minister Marape also called on community leaders, churches, and citizens to work together with the police in addressing law and order issues, emphasising that security is a shared responsibility.
“We must reclaim our communities from the grip of crime. I call on our people to report any suspicious activities and support the police with credible information. Those who protect criminals or refuse to cooperate with law enforcement are complicit in these crimes,” he said.
The Prime Minister reaffirmed his government’s commitment to strengthening law and order, increasing police presence, and ensuring that criminal activities are stamped out.
“My government has already begun investing in boosting police resources, increasing manpower, and improving law enforcement capabilities. We will not rest until every Papua New Guinean feels safe in their own country. Every woman, every child, and every citizen deserve to live in a society free from fear and violence.”
Prime Minister Marape extended his deepest condolences to the family of the victim and assured them that the government stands with them in their time of grief.
“My thoughts and prayers are with the victim’s family. No words can undo the pain they are experiencing, but I assure them that justice will be done. This is a defining moment for our nation to unite against crime, to take a stand against violence, and to build a Papua New Guinea where all citizens can live in safety and dignity.”"

Although many are grown, the Taiwanese do not plan to sell them, instead are growing them for demonstration and propagation purposes and see how well it can thrive on PNG soil.

Manam islanders briefed about court orders,14/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3192,,Human Rights,Trust,Nill,"The Manam Human Rights Advocacy Group (MHRAG) which took the national government to court for human rights negligence against the 10,000 plus displaced Manam Islanders in Madang Province have started holding awareness sessions to inform people of the outcome of the court case and the implications of the court orders that were handed down by the National Court in Madang in September last year.
Starting on Monday 10th February, 2025, the team led by the Chairman Bruce Silla and his deputy Stanis Tibong and other executives started the awareness meetings from Asuramba Care Centre to Potsdam Care Centres, meeting with the displaced  islanders there.
Further on the island, they commenced at Kuluguma village on Monday 10th then on to Boda and Baliau the following days. They will continue to the other remaining villages in the next couple of weeks including Boesa island.
The meetings are to meet the people and fill them in on the court case and the implications of the court orders that were handed down bythe  National Court’s Justice Narakobi in September last year in Madang.
The National Court awarded 12 court orders in favour of more than 10,000 people, in which the national government was taken to task to respond accordingly to negligence of certain human rights, identified in the orders.
The Manam Islands took the state to court for breaching several human rights of the 10,000 plus displaced people of Manam after two major volcanic eruptions of 1994 and 2004.  A court case that spanned over almost four years concluded last year with twelve orders issued:
1) The implementation of the government’s program for permanent resettlement within a 24-month period,
2) Provision of monthly food rations until permanent resettlement,
3) For the establishment of a Police post for the care centers,
4) For the establishment of a fully-equipped doctor at the care centres,
5) For the provision of school fees for school children until permanent resettlement, and
6) For the immediate rehabilitation of the care centres, including repair and maintenance of water pumps installed in 2005 and others.
According to the MHRAG President, Bruce Silla, the response of the people has been very positive. Two major demands from the people are: the government to award full school subsidy for all Manam students; and for Manam Resettlement Authority (MaRA) to put it’s act in order in regard to its major task which is ‘resettlement’ of the people.
The National Court has scheduled to review the implementation of the court orders by 3rd March 2025, thus the advocacy group is moving against time to reach all the people before the review date."

Gregory Wii, appeared before the Madang District court for his first mention yesterday when his bail application was also heard.
The court denied him bail due to the gravity of the allegations against him and has been remanded at the Beon Correctional Facility together with his four co-accused.
The incident in question occurred on February 7th when constable Wii allegedly discharged shots into the air in close proximity to the residence of Dr. Jimmy Aipit around Kalibobo area. In addition, a video was captured during Dr. Aipit and his family’s ordeal and went viral on social media.

Provincial Police Commander, Acting Superintendent Robert Baim emphasized the duty of security forces to protect and serve the community, stating that, “Security forces are not above the law.

A father’s advise to young women and girls,14/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3187,,Society,Sadness,Nill,"Corporal Emmanuel Numbalihi has just lost his eldest daughter in a brutal murder. Now he’s  calling on the younger generation to choose wisely who they intend to spend the rest of their lives with before having children with that person.
Young women who are in toxic and abusive relationships have also been challenged to leave before it is too late.
Emmanuel Numbalihi made these calls following the death of her eldest daughter at the hands of the very person she would have sought protection from. Lina was brutally tortured to death by her partner early this week.
“Today's generation who wish to get married must not marry a person who has money or a nice paying job, rather you must inquire if that person is genuine and capable of looking after you, look after your immediate family and is available to provide help when need to be. These are the types of people you must consider spending your future with.
“Another reminder is to seek approval from your parents before considering a future with that person. If your parents do not approve that relationship, then leave. Always trust your parent's opinion.
“As for late Lina, we did not approve her marriage with the perpetrator because he did not meet our expectations.
“With the inception of technology, many young people are influenced to do many things either good nor bad behind closed doors. Often they lie to their parents who think that they are with their friends, however, they are hanging out with their girlfriends or boyfriends. Therefore, it is important for younger generations to practice discipline and obey your parents. By doing that your life will be blessed in the future,” he said.
Late Lina’s father further warned young mothers who are in a toxic and abusive relationship to leave that relationship. Failure to do so may result in domestic violence or even death."

Operation Open Heart team arrives,13/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3183,,Health,Joy,Nill,"A heart specialist team of eight arrived in Port Moresby today for the annual Operation Open Heart program.
The international group of specialists will team up with some of Papua New Guinea’s best medical talents to perform open-heart surgeries over the course of the next three days.
Leading the team is Anaesthetist Dr Darren Wolfers, a pioneer of the Operation Open Heart program since its inception in 1994.
For over 30 years now, the program has been providing life-saving, heart surgeries for the people of Papua New Guinea.
On arrival today, with a specialist team of eight, Dr Wolfers highlighted the advancement of the Papua New Guinea’s own medical professionals.
When asked about how proud he was of the progress of the program he said, “We’re actually not proud of ourselves, we’re proud of the local team. You will notice from when we come, we’ve had teams as big as sixty people, we’re down to eight. And the reason we’re down to eight is because the local program is going so well. So that’s what we should be proud of, just like the country is developing, so is the cardio-surgical program.”
The international team is set to have a brief with their Papua New Guinea counterparts this afternoon with the patient list confirmed.
However, Dr Wolfers said, “I believe we’re gonna be doing five operations in the next three days. We’re not doing the surgery. We’re gonna be assisting the local team to do the work. We’re gonna be focusing mainly on adults on this trip. But there’ll be some more pediatric trips coming later in the year.”
Dr Wolfers describes his arrival today as somewhat of a home-coming since his last trip to PNG was in 2019, almost five years ago.
“I was born in Port Moresby General Hospital. I’m back in my home country, back to see my wantoks. But it’s been five years. It’s fantastic to be back, I can’t tell you how excited I am.”
For over three decades, Operation Open Heart has given thousands of Papua New Guineans a second chance at life."
"Over 2,000 students register at FODE centre",13/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3175,,Education,Trust,"Julius Chan, Sir Julius Chan","Over 2,500 students are expected to register at Morobe’s Flexible Open Distance Education (FODE) Centre, in Lae, by the end of February.
FODE is an alternate pathway for students that have been pushed out of the formal, or conventional education system, to upgrade their marks and keep working towards their dreams.
Morobe’s FODE Centre has so far registered more than 2,500 students; and more are still coming.
Provincial FODE Coordinator, Helen Elecor, said the intakes are not only from Lae; they are also from the rural districts of Morobe and from Madang, East Sepik and the Highlands region.
“Registration started on the 4th of February because on the 3rd, we couldn’t do that because of the death of the late Sir Julius Chan,” said Elecor. “
So, from the 4th, we saw a huge population coming here for registration. We estimated about 2,500 to be registered but we have jumped that figure so we had to print extra orientation notes for the parents.”
Elecor said they came up with the idea of orientation notes this year as many parents and students were still confused about the functions of a FODE centre.
Additionally, the registration process was faster this year as the centre’s bank deposit slips and receipts were printed by the PNG University of Technology (Unitech), and were readily available to students and guardians.
“Before we started registration, our boys were doing printing and collating in the night,” explained Elecor. “But I think we will approach Unitech to do some of our printings as well.
“So, our biggest challenge is finance. One purchase made to print our materials will cost around K20,000; 100 boxes of A4 papers, coloured papers and ink.
“We have our mini printery there with four men handling it. All the other staff members help with collating, so that is how we’ve managed to survive.”
To support itself, the FODE Centre charges an administration fee of K205; K100 for registration, K65 for uniforms and K40 for ID cards.
“We are charging K40 this year because we want to print that on a PVC (polyvinyl chloride) card.
“We are also collecting assignment fees. When students bring their completed assignments, we record them then give to secondary school teachers to help us mark them. We then pay them K5 per booklet. We collect K6 from a student, K5 goes to the marker and K1 for our centre; for our ink and paper.
“And in the event that a student scores below 60 percent; that’s this year’s percentage for ‘redo’ assignments. So, after they do the assignments, the teachers will calculate and if they score below 60 percent, we will ask them to pay a penalty fee of K20 to redo the assignment. So, these are some of the ways we are making money to support our operation.”"

“The late Sir Julius Chan was a key architect of our country's financial system and made significant contributions during both the pre- and post-independence era.”
Mano mentioned that Sir Julius’ life extended beyond politics. Culturally, he had a deep-rooted background in his province and the islands community.
“We believe that it’s fitting to now share this moment with Sir Julius' family by attending his burial at his home in Manmantinut, Huris, Namatanai.”
The business community in the islands region also contributed to the haus krai (funeral), which the team brought to Huris, the final resting place of the late Sir Julius.
Mano said the trip was meant to demonstrate that the loss is not just theirs, but it is a loss for everyone in the region and the entire country.
He urged leaders in whatever positions they hold in politics, business, family or clan to emulate the late Sir Julius Chan’s life.
He commended the business community, parliamentary leaders, civil servants and the general public for making the trip to Namatanai to mourn the loss of a great leader and founder."

The Papua New Guinea Defence Force has assured the family that the offender will be brought to justice.
“We cannot accept this act,” Chief of Defence Force Rear Admiral Philip Polewara said.
“It is totally unacceptable and does not reflect the values and beliefs of the PNGDF.  And I want to assure the parents and the family of the deceased spouse that we will work with the police to hunt and apprehend the member so that justice can be served.”
The PNGDF through the Military Police have taken action since the report of the incident was received on Sunday 9th February. On the same day, military police personnel had moved into the member’s room and cordoned it off to allow for civil police to conduct their investigations.
Formal enquiries were also conducted to establish witnesses before, during and after the incident. This has resulted in identifying a key witness to the crime.

MKA blames election delay to lack of funding,13/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3168,,Politics,Anger,"Lohia Boe Samuel, Powes Parkop","The Motu-Koita Assembly has responded to a petition presented this week demanding the immediate conduct of the Assembly Elections and a change of office executives. MKA chairman, Dadi Toka Jr has attributed the delay in the conduct of elections to a lack of funding.
Dadi Toka Jr in a statement assured the people and stakeholders that the administration has always been prepared and ready to support the elections since 2023. However, he said the funding allocation of K750, 000 by NCDC in 2023 for this purpose was insufficient as the assembly needed K7 million to conduct the elections as advised by the Electoral Commission.
“This K7million is supposed to be funded by the national government under the national Bbdget. This has not happened for the last three years. Every November since 2022 when the national budget is passed into law by Parliament, the MKA administration always immediately checks if the allocation has been made to fund the Motu Koita elections. For three consecutive years we have not seen any allocations at all, and we do not know why this fails to happen every year.”
He further stated that the 2023 election was also delayed due to deficiencies in the electoral roll like missing names (between 30 per cent to 70 per cent of previously registered voters’ names missing), logistics issues as well as constant changing of key dates for the roll update exercise.
However, Member for North West, Lohia Boe Samuel who led the petitioners on Monday states otherwise.
“There is no law stating that Cencus should be a reason for a delay of elections, so we don’t accept that.”
Meantime, while the MKA Chairman has blamed the lack of funds for the ongoing delay in MKA elections,
NCD Governor Powes Parkop upon receiving the petition on Monday mentioned that funds shouldn’t be an issue and can be solved.
“Last year, we put money in NCDC budget to fund the Motu-Koita elections, this year too, we have just passed our budget last Tuesday, and there is a funding to for Motu-Koita. We have funded the in the past as well. So funding is not really an issue.
Parkop further said, “Perhaps, if there's an issue we can solve that because when the Assembly is in election or is sort of in a transition, we can also use the money allocated to Motu-Koita Assembly to fund your election. It's your money, we are spending it on your election. So if the Electoral Commission doesn't have the money, of course, we can, back up the Electoral Commission, and we've done that in the past. It's normal practice.”
The petition also indicated an immediate removal of the current assembly members, including incumbent Chairman Dadi Toka Jr., and appointment of an interim caretaker administration to prevent misuse of MKA funds.
MKA confirmed that on Wednesday 5th February 2025, K500,000 was approved to support the 2025 MKA Elections and they now await official directions from the PNG Electoral Commission regarding confirmed MKA election dates for 2025."

K1.4 billion loan within budget framework,12/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3151,,Politics,Trust,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has provided assurances on the K1.4 billion (approximately A$580 million) loan from the Australian Government, stating that it is well within Papua New Guinea’s 2024 Budget framework and does not increase the country’s debt burden beyond planned fiscal targets.
Speaking at the NASFUND FM100 Talkback Show launch on Monday, PM Marape reiterated that the loan is part of the government’s fiscal strategy and fits within its ongoing fiscal consolidation plan.
“It’s within our 3.3% deficit of last year. Those of you commentators in the economic space, our report on our budgeting side is clearly outlined in our final budget outcomes,” the Prime Minister explained.
PM Marape emphasised that PNG remains on track towards achieving a balanced budget by 2027, with consistent deficit reductions over the past five years.
“We want to move to a surplus in 2027, and we are on target. In 2020, our deficit was at a high of over 8% due to COVID-19. Since then, we have scaled down: in 2022, it was around 5.3%, in 2023, it was 4.3%, and last year, we brought it down to 3.3%,” he stated.
The Prime Minister reassured the public that the Australian loan is not an additional financial burden but rather part of an agreed-upon fiscal framework.
“The Australian financing is within the 2024 money plan, part of our 3.3% deficit element. It is not something new and does not aggravate our debt plan. It is consistent,” he said. Furthermore, the terms of the loan include a grace period and a 4.2% interest rate, making it a structured and manageable component of PNG’s financial plan.
“By the way, concessional means grace period and a 4.2% interest rate,” PM Marape added. The government remains committed to responsible financial management while ensuring that resources are effectively utilised for economic growth.
PNG’s fiscal strategy is aligned with long-term economic resilience, and the government will continue to make strategic financial decisions that balance growth and fiscal responsibility. “I want to give assurance to our country: we are on a fiscal consolidation path. Our target remains clear-stabilising our economy while ensuring sustainable financial management,” PM Marape concluded."

PNG’s efforts in addressing corruption not reflective in 2024 corruption report,12/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3158,,Politics,Disgust,Nill,"Papua New Guinea has scored 31 out of 100 countries in the 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).
The 2024 CPI index scoring for PNG reflects a high perceived risk of encountering corruption in interactions with the public sector in the country.
TIPNG Chair Peter Aitsi during the launch of the 2024 CPI yesterday in Port Moresby said the country’s CPI score paints a stark picture that despite pledges and sporadic efforts, PNG is not making a significant impact in the fight against corruption.
“This lack of progress has dire consequences, most notably the recent Financial Action Taskforce (FATF grey-listing, which has serious flow on impacts to our international banking arrangements and country credit rating,” he said.
“The result of the CPI and FATF assessments are a clear indicator that Papua New Guinea is failing to take action on corruption. Millions are still being stolen through various means which robes the public and prevents them from accessing essential services such as quality education and health, it reduces economic and income opportunities and undermines trust in the government,” Aitsi said.
The Corruption Perception Index is a report that scores countries and territories around the world that record perceptions of public sector corruption. The scores reflect the surveyed views of economic experts and business people, not the general public. Countries are scored on a scale of 0 to 100. Hundred being very clean and zero being highly corrupt.
TIPNG CEO Arianne Kassman said the CPI index clearly shows that there is no effective process to combat corruption in PNG.
Meanwhile, ICAC Deputy Commissioner Daniel Baulch said failure to stop corruption may result in dire impacts on economic process, and security concerns, among others."

Commander of NCD Central, Acting Assistant Commissioner of Police Benjamin Turi while condemning the act of the policeman in Madang who assaulted a medical doctor said there was a similar case in Port Moresby last year, citing the case of two police officers in NCD who assaulted a doctor last year in September at the Gerehu hospital.
He said the police officers were arrested and charged and were dismissed from the police force. He said this should teach other police officers to work ethically. He said police departments have the police code of ethics and police officers must allow this to guide their conduct.
“I want the police officers to recite your police code of ethics which is the guide that will lead you to do your job ethically. In every organisation, there are set rules and guides that all must follow. If the police code of ethics says to protect lives and properties then we do not have to harm other people if the situation does not allow us. We must always try to manage our anger when we approach situations that will provoke us to do something wrong,” Commander Turi said.
He said it was confirmed that the police officers were under the influence of liquor when they committed the offences. He said there had been much awareness done to police officers not to drink and go to work. He said records had shown that most of the police officers who were dismissed from the force had their records related to consuming liquor when they committed the offences.
Commander Turi said each police station commander, the section heads, and officers who are taking control of police officers should remind their officers not to come to work intoxicated."

Sohe DDA Approves K54.8Mil Budget,11/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3145,,Government,Anticipation,Henry Amuli,"The Sohe District Development Authority (SDDA) has approved a budget of K54.8 million for the 2025 fiscal year.
The Budget income includes K24.7 million rollover funds and K33.7 million for new revenue projections and estimates.
Sohe MP and DDA chairman, Henry Amuli emphasized the importance of prudent management of funds to ensure intended projects and programs are delivered.

There are four Local Level Governments (LLGs) in Sohe, two of which are very remote and not connected by roads. Amuli said delays to projects have been due to court disputes from 2017 elections, however he is now committed to delivering projects.
""We have over K24 million funds roll over from last year being tied to various impact projects and once Treasury Department approves our budget, we will start implementation,"" he said.
He said few impact projects include commencement of work on new Sohe District Administration complex and three new telecommunication infrastructures to enhance network coverage in remote communities.

PNG’s electoral process needs overhaul,11/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3144,,Politics,Fear,Nill,"Papua New Guinea’s electoral process must be fixed before the 2027 national general election, says the President of PNG Law Society Hubert Namanai.
Namani said this during the 2025 legal year opening in the National Capital District recently.
“If we do not fix our electoral process now, we risk even greater instability in 2027, and judging from the January 10th event, I fear the worst.
“We are also learning with serious concerns that the 2022 Electoral Boundaries Commission maps created inconsistencies, leaving some areas without proper representation while others overlap. This is a blunder that must be called and not be ignored.
“A glaring example of our systemic failure is the deeply flawed electoral process, which undermines democracy at its core.
“Widespread irregularities, violence, and compromised integrity have eroded public trust, making urgent electoral reforms essential to restore faith in our democratic institutions and governance.
He said the legitimacy of any government depends on free and fair elections, but PNG continues to operate under a broken system.
“The best gift the Government can give to our people as we look to the next 50 years and beyond is a reformed electoral process.
“A system that ensures every citizen’s vote counts, that is free from violence and fraud, and that restores faith in our democracy."
Bugandi celebrates growth,11/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3141,,Education,Trust,John Rosso,"Prudent school management is important if an institution is to progress.
Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, outlined this when opening a new 8-in-1 classroom for Bugandi Secondary School on Monday, 10 February.
Rosso has always emphasised on prudent management and what can be achieved if leaders are transparent and accountable in their dealings.
Education institutions are no different, with Rosso outlining that the appointment of a good principal was the first step in restoring one of Lae’s oldest schools, the Bugandi Secondary School.
Bugandi, from being a top school, dropped in academic performance, had badly deteriorated classrooms – which were built in the 60s – no stationery, no electricity and no water supply due to unpaid bills, students were in half uniforms and were always involved in school fights.
Things started turning around in 2022 when Rosso visited the school and decided to change Bugandi’s administration.
“The next step was to look for a good principal because a sense of everything you do – everyone gives credit to someone like me; someone like me gets the ideas but you need people behind the scenes to make it run and happen.
“I visited Christopher Raymond at Lae Secondary School – I’m an ex-Lae sec student – and with Dennis Miall, your current principal. I said: ‘We really need a good manager at Bugandi. Not just a principal but a manager, to motivate people, to make sure everything runs well. I’ll put money into it. But who’s going to run for me?’
“So, Dennis, I can reflect, he said: ‘Wssh, I don’t want. That school has a lot of problems.’”
Rosso and Lae secondary’s principal managed to convince Miall, who was then transferred to Bugandi to start restoration efforts.
“I looked at the teachers and I felt really sorry,” continued Rosso. “They were struggling to teach students with very little support.
“Basically, the school was in a bad shape; financial mismanagement, it was not running properly. So, having Dennis appointed was one first step, then having a school board made up of good citizens to help the principal and staff run it, and then having a good staff with their morale being boosted, to help teach the children. And most importantly, making sure that the students were proud of coming to this school.”
Because of good management, the Lae City Authority funded Bugandi’s Grade 12 8-in-1 classroom last year, and this year, they opened another new 8-in-1 classroom for the Grade 11 students.
Every grade will have a new classroom building, with plans to build ablution facilities and a basketball court for Bugandi as well."
Major reforms expected for SOEs,11/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3140,,Business,Anticipation,James Marape,"Major restructure is expected in the coming months for State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in order to improve efficiency, service delivery, and financial sustainability.
Prime Minister James Marape outlined the government’s plan to restructure key SOEs, focusing on introducing private sector expertise while maintaining government oversight.
He said key sectors like electricity and telecommunications, needed partial privatisation to enhance management and improve performance.
Addressing concerns over PNG Power’s inefficiency and unreliable electricity supply, Prime Minister Marape emphasised that private sector involvement is necessary to stabilise and improve service delivery.
“Power is a critical service, and we must ensure that PNG Power operates at a high standard. This means bringing in private sector expertise to improve management, infrastructure investment, and accountability,” he said.
The proposed reforms will ensure better infrastructure investment, more reliable electricity supply, and a financially sustainable PNG Power.
Marape said the telecommunications sector is also a priority for reform to improve service quality, affordability, and nationwide access to mobile and internet services. The government seeks private sector participation to drive faster internet, expanded coverage, and competitive pricing.
He acknowledged that the operational environment for SOEs has changed significantly since 1975, and it is no longer sustainable for the government to run these entities in the same way.
“We have been running our SOEs under the public service model for too long. “The conditions today are different from those in 1975. Back then, it was about delivering services as a public good. Now, these businesses must be run with efficiency and profitability in mind while still serving the people.”
Marape said to improve management and financial stability, the government is moving towards a 51 percent-49 percent public-private partnership model, where the government retains majority ownership while private investors take control of management and operations.
“We are looking at a model where we retain 51 percent ownership, while private sector partners hold 49 percent and manage the operations,” he explained.
“We call on investors—whether you are local, international, or superannuation funds—to take part in these reforms. When you hold 49 percent, you take management control, while the government remains a shareholder benefiting from dividends and improved services,” Prime Minister Marape added.
He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to SOE reforms as a key pillar of economic growth."
Motu-Koitabuans demand for MKA election,11/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3139,,Politics,Anger,"Lohia Boe Samuel, Powes Parkop, Soroi Eoe","Motu Koitabuans have expressed frustration over delay of the Motu Koita Assembly (MKA) elections, calling for the removal of Assembly members.
Motu Koitabu leaders gathered at the Sir Hubert Murray Stadium on Monday and presented a petition to the NCD Governor, Powes Parkop demanding immediate election.
Leading the petitioners was Member for North West, Lohia Boe Samuel, who said it was time to make the move, as many people have remained silent for too long.
He said for seven years, the MKA did not hold elections due to continuous delays. The petition signed by intending candidates and community stakeholders was addressed to the Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, Soroi Eoe and the Electoral Commissioner, Simon Sinai calling for an immediate election.
“We believed in the system, and the system has failed us. We've been waiting and waiting and the current regime has been in office for seven years. We cannot remain silent any longer,” said Samuel.
“The petition cites Section 50 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to vote and stand for public office. It states that the ongoing delay in holding elections is unconstitutional and denies the Motu Koita people their democratic rights. Current leadership has held office for over seven years, exceeding its legal term.”
Samuel said in 2023, about K750,000 was allocated by NCDC for the elections, which was not held. In 2024, election was again deferred without legal justification.
“We are demanding that our voices be heard, the people of Motu Koita have been deprived of their democratic rights. It is imperative that we conduct these elections without further delay to restore transparency, accountability, and trust in our governance,” stated Russell Simon Wavik, Fred Oala, and Nou Mataio, prominent Motu Koitabuans and intending candidates of the Motu Koita Assembly.
The petition stated the following;
•	Confirm an immediate date for the Motu Koita Assembly Elections
•	Adequate resources and logistical support for the elections
•	Transparent and fair electoral processes
•	Immediate removal of the current assembly members
Upon receiving the petition, Governor for NCD, Powes Parkop shared that he is concerned about the delay of MKA elections.
“Last year, we put money in NCDC budget to fund the Motu-Koita Election, and this year as we passed the new budget last Tuesday and there is funding for the Motu-Koita Assembly. We have funded the Motu-Koita Assembly in the past, so funding is not an issue.
“I acknowledge that the election has been delayed for a while, that is not fair, not right, and probably not legal. That's a matter not within my jurisdiction and power and authority, but as governor to have equal concern that Motu-Koita Assembly must have properly mandated leaders when one’s term has ended.”
The petitioners have given the Minister and Electoral Commissioner 21 days to respond, warning that failure to act will result in legal action."

PM to review government performance,10/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3135,,Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,"Prime Minister James Marape has announced a thorough review of government performance, with all department heads and ministers set to report on their progress, challenges, and plans.
This three-week assessment, leading up to the March Parliament session, aims to ensure effective governance and alignment with Papua New Guinea’s long-term economic vision.
“We are not a new government anymore. This is our sixth year in office, and we must be honest about what has been achieved and what still needs to be done. We cannot afford delays—we must move forward with urgency and focus,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
As part of the government’s long-term vision, Marape reaffirmed his commitment to economic transformation through import replacement, export-driven growth, and downstream processing.
“I just want to bring forward my own approach—to ramp up import replacement, focus on exports, and ensure people are actively participating in the economy. Downstream processing is the key to growing the economy, moving to K200 billion by 2030 and K3 trillion by 2048,” he said.
To achieve this, the government will focus on:
- Expanding PNG’s export base while reducing dependency on imports.
- Investing in ICT and green energy to drive innovation and sustainable development.
- Strengthening key sectors such as agriculture, mining, and fisheries to generate long-term revenue and employment.
The prime minister stressed that accountability is a priority, starting with his own Prime Minister’s Department, followed by Treasury, Planning, Finance, and other ministries.
“This scrutiny will involve cameras recording every conversation by department heads. I don’t want to carry free riders—I am running, and I want people to run with me, not walk when I am running,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Ministers and department heads will be assessed on their performance over the past two and a half years, with potential restructuring for those who fail to meet expectations.
“This is not personal. This is not about targeting someone—it is about being honest and making sure we are working and making progress instead of just occupying positions while doing little.
“I have no more time to waste. With over six years of experience as Prime Minister, I am ready to make bold decisions and cut out unproductive areas so our country can flourish.”
The prime minister emphasised that major reforms are needed, including:
- Public service restructuring to improve efficiency.
- Provincial government system reviews to strengthen decentralisation.
- Conclusion of the Bougainville Peace Agreement.
- Resource law reforms.
- State enterprise reforms.
- Fixing police and law enforcement agencies to improve security and governance.
- Judicial reforms.
- Parliamentary reforms.
“We are marking 50 years of independence, and it is time for bold and productive leadership. My generation must step up—with energy, commitment, and urgency—to fix today’s challenges and build a stronger PNG for the future.
“This government review will lead to a detailed 20-year roadmap, ensuring economic growth, governance stability, and national progress from 2025 to 2045, positioning PNG as a developed nation in line with Vision 2050.”"

As Papua New Guinea mourns the passing of some of its most distinguished leaders, Prime Minister Marape said leaders must ensure that public funds are translated into tangible development for the people.
Speaking from Gasmata, West New Britain, the Prime Minister paid tribute to the late Sir Julius Chan, Sir John Luke Crittin of Milne Bay, Sir Charles Lepani, and Sir Paul Songo, acknowledging their contributions to the nation’s founding and development.
He noted that as their generation departs, the responsibility of leading and serving the country now rests with today’s leaders.
Prime Minister Marape emphasised that public resources allocated to District Development Authorities, Provincial Governments, and Ministries must be effectively utilized.
“We must ensure that every kina we allocate is used for development. We cannot afford delays or mismanagement. I do not expect miracles, but I do expect results. Wherever funding has been provided, work must be taking place—in the districts, in the provinces, and our ministries. We all have to serve.”
The Prime Minister reminded Governors and District MPs that they hold a full five-year mandate to implement meaningful change, whereas the Office of the Prime Minister is subject to the political realities of the 18-month grace period.
“Governments may change, but development must not stall. Districts and provinces must continue delivering long-term improvements that align with our National Government’s Medium-Term Development Plan. There can be no excuses for stagnation,” Prime Minister Marape said.
He said accountability is essential and that public servants, government agencies, and leaders must ensure that projects are completed efficiently and transparently.
Prime Minister Marape highlighted that under his leadership, the Government ensured all districts— whether aligned with the Government or the Opposition—received equal and fair funding:
• K10 million in District and Provincial Services Improvement Programme funds
• An additional K5 million in Special Infrastructure Grants
“That is K15 million per district as the baseline allocation. We will also look at matching district and provincial priorities with a Kina-for-Kina policy. Additionally, my government will tailor an extra fund to cover the cost of service delivery for remote rural districts.
“We will set up a National Monitoring Authority to ensure all development funds are expended in line with government priorities and deliver maximum results.”
“One day, we too will be carried on the shoulders of our youth and laid to rest in the land of our birth. What legacy will we leave behind?”
“The people are watching. The nation is waiting. Let us honour those who built this country by delivering meaningful change for the future of Papua New Guinea. Time is short—we must act now.”"
Cancer referral systems need improvement,9/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3125,,Health,Fear,Nill,"There is an urgent call to improve the referral pathway for patients diagnosed with Cancer.
This was the call by the Director of Public Health, Dr Amos Lano, attached under the NCD Provincial Health Authority. He stressed the improvement of the health referral systems due to the growing number of Cancer patients in the country.
In commemorating Cancer Day recently, and addressing the challenges faced by the country against the killer Cancer disease, Dr Lano also called for more awareness this year.
“We must screen our patients early, that's the work of the public health team. So, this year, we have decided to revive our Mobile programs. We will be sending our teams to all the settlements, the big villages in Motu Koita, the marketplaces, and even the office environment.”
He said people needed to understand that early cancer detection is very important in making sure someone is free of Cancer, and early treatment can save lives.
Apart from increasing awareness, Dr Amos said the referral system needs to be improved in the country to improve the flow of patients and allow better treatment and results.
“We want to strengthen the referral system so that our patients can get early treatment, and if so we can diagnose.”
Furthermore, Dr Lano shared that the country’s challenge now is the lack of Oncologist. An Oncologist specializes in diagnosing and treating cancer.
Dr Lano said with the increase in cancer patients more specialists are needed for PNG’s fight against cancer.
“The key message to the National Health Department is we must look at training more doctors, even more helpers and technicians. We have the latest machines and facilities coming into the country, but we want local people to run those facilities.”"

Guidelines launched to safe guide PNG waters,8/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3114,,Government,Trust,"Justin Tkatchenko, Pila Niningi","The Department of Justice and Attorney General, Office of Oceans Affairs, and the Department of Foreign Affairs have launched the revised Marine Scientific Research Guidelines 2024 on Thursday, February 06th,  in Port Moresby.
The Papua New Guinea government adopted the revised Marine Science Research (MSR) Guidelines, marking a significant step forward in the country’s commitment to sustainable ocean management and the well-being of our people.
The guidelines including the National Oceans policy implementation plan 2024-2030 were approved by NEC on December 18th, 2024, marking a significant step in ocean governance and protection.
The program is chaired by DJAG and core chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, they are members of the Marine Scientific Research Committee. These entities work together to ensure that the ocean space is properly protected and governed under relevant laws and policies.
According to the Minister for Justice and Attorney General Pila Niningi, all relevant authorities must seek the consent of the Marin Scientific Research Committee to issue an exploration license for mining and petroleum. This will protect the ocean and marine environment from exploitation and risk to the marine environment.
DJAG Secretary Dr Erick Kwa further stated that launching of the guidelines is a milestone achievement for the people, especially for the coastal communities, the 600-plus islands, and the 15 maritime provinces.
“It is important to protect our ocean and marine life and to use it sustainably for the benefit of the people, the country and the future,” Kwa said.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Justin Tkatchenko said Papua New Guinea’s economy zone is one of the largest in the world, however, we are in danger of losing our legitimate rights to maritime boundaries and excess maritime resources. Climate change, illegal fishing, and transnational crimes are some of the challenges. However, the implementation of the MSR guidelines, will enhance national security, and support suitable fisheries management, among others.

"Cop arrested, doctors return to work",7/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3095,,Crime,Anger,Nill,"A home video showing an armed policeman threatening the life of the medical doctor in the Madang Province is making its rounds on social media. He and three others have been arrested and detained.
Eight individuals are allegedly involved in the incident involving the doctor and his family. Constable Gregory Wii, the gun-wielding policeman in the viral video, and four civilian accomplices, are now in police custody at the Jomba holding cell. Charges will be laid once statements of both parties are completed. Police investigations into the matter will also determine the arrest of the other four.
Alfred Kambae from the Police Internal Investigations Unit, reassured disgruntled medical staff this morning that Constable Wii has been stripped off his uniform and disarmed.
Meantime, the Modilon Hospital medical staff have assumed normal duties.
Provincial Police Commander, Robert Baim, will later issue a formal statement to verify details of the incident and likely what triggered this confrontation."
Suspect a repeat offender,7/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3097,,Law,Anger,Nill,"The suspect in the alleged doctor assault case in Madang is a repeat offender, according to Police Commissioner David Manning.
He was terminated in 2023 for similar offences, but reinstated by the courts.
“It is extremely concerning that the accused in this matter has been dismissed from the RPNGC in 2023 as part of my crack down on unprofessional conduct. This was in relation to serious criminal offending, however, the National Court intervened by way of injunction and directed the member to remain in uniform,” stated Manning.
“The people of our country rightly epect more from our disciplined personnel, and under this government we have a no-nonsense approach,” Manning said.
Manning has also directed for the investigation of commanding officers in Madang.
“There has been a clear failure in command at the local level in Madang and the senior personnel are facing immediate administrative action,” he said. “Effectively it means that those in local operational command will be relieved of duty until further notice and subject to investigation by Internal Affairs Directorate.”

Prime Minister's final tribute to Sir Julius,7/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3111,,Politics,Sadness,"James Marape, Julius Chan, Michael Somare, Paias Wingti, Sir Julius Chan","Prime Minister James Marape delivered a moving tribute at the burial of Right Honourable Sir Julius Chan, honouring his unparalleled service, statesmanship, and enduring legacy in Papua New Guinea on Thursday 6 February.
Speaking before Sir Julius’ family, the people of New Ireland, and the nation, Prime Minister Marape reflected on his extraordinary contributions to PNG’s political and economic landscape, describing him as one of the nation’s most influential and transformative leaders.
“Sir Julius was a giant among men,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“If Sir Michael Somare was the North Pole of Papua New Guinea’s politics, then Sir Julius Chan was the South Pole—together shaping the modern nation we call home.”
Sir Julius’ legacy is deeply intertwined with PNG’s nationhood, dating back to 1968, when he led a delegation to the United Nations, advocating that Papua New Guinea was ready for independence. He entered Parliament that same year, joining the pioneering generation that would steer the country toward self-governance and eventual independence from Australia in 1975.
As a founding figure of the People’s Progress Party (PPP), Sir Julius formed a coalition with PANGU Pati in 1972 to prepare PNG for self-government and independence. His role in shaping the country’s economic foundation was profound—he helped establish the Bank of Papua New Guinea and introduced the kina and toea in 1975, overseeing the phasing out of the Australian dollar as PNG asserted its financial sovereignty.
Prime Minister Marape reflected on Sir Julius’ distinguished career, highlighting key moments in his leadership, from his rise as Deputy Prime Minister in the mid-1970s to becoming PNG’s second Prime Minister in 1980—the first leader to ascend to the role through a successful vote of no confidence (VONC).
“He was the first architect of our financial institutions and economy, the founder of our Central Bank, and the man who helped shape the value of our kina,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
“He stood in many of the monumental moments of our nation’s 49-year history and played a defining role in PNG’s place in the United Nations.”
Sir Julius continued to play a critical role in PNG’s political evolution, helping Paias Wingti become the third Prime Minister in 1985 through another successful VONC. He later returned to the prime ministership in 1994, following Wingti’s removal as Prime Minister, further cementing his status as one of the country’s most influential leaders.
His second tenure as Prime Minister was marked by some of PNG’s most defining moments, including leading the country through the devastating Rabaul volcanic eruption in 1994, and presiding over the floating of the kina in 1994, a move that fundamentally changed PNG’s economy. However, his leadership was most tested during the 1997 Sandline Crisis, a moment of political turmoil that led him to step aside for the sake of the nation’s stability.
“He willingly stepped down as Prime Minister in 1997, showing his humility and commitment to national unity,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“Few leaders in history have had the wisdom and strength to make such a sacrifice.”
Sir Julius made history once again in 1997, becoming the first sitting Prime Minister to lose an election, a moment that shocked the nation. However, he remained deeply committed to public service and, a decade later, won his way back into politics, becoming the Governor of New Ireland in 2007—a role he held until his passing, championing regional autonomy, economic growth, and social development for his people.
“Sir Julius represented humility, kindness, dedication, patriotism, lawful living, management of time, honesty, tolerance of diverse opinions, and above all, a visionary leader,” Prime Minister Marape remarked.
Prime Minister Marape assured the people of New Ireland that Sir Julius’ contributions will be preserved for generations to come, announcing that Pangu Pati will support the establishment of the Sir Julius Chan Museum in Kavieng to preserve his speeches, writings, and leadership philosophies.
“No monument can truly encapsulate the legacy of Sir Julius, but we will ensure that his wisdom and leadership are never forgotten,” the Prime Minister stated. As Papua New Guinea approaches its 50th anniversary of independence, Prime Minister Marape called on the nation to reflect on the sacrifices and dedication of its founding fathers.
“You and I know some of the conversations we have had,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“I want to say, I am sorry if I have not lived up to your expectations, but we look forward to correcting the past and moving forward for the good of our people.”
As he concluded, the Prime Minister expressed deep sorrow and gratitude for Sir Julius’ lifetime of service.
“Sir Julius, you have set sail on your final journey, and I wish you eternal peace as you find.
He reassured the people of New Ireland that the national government stands in solidarity with them, as they mourn and celebrate the life of one of PNG’s greatest leaders.
“I will return when the traditional ceremonies continue for the conclusion of his entire burial process. You will see me back here,” Prime Minister Marape pledged."

The Green Climate Fund is the organization mandated to manage the global funds for related programs worldwide under the UN convention on climate change.
Host Governor Powes Parkop, said the city is ready to receive the delegates as the city has played host to many international events in the last 10 years.
“We have hosted the 2016 FIFA Under – 20 Women’s Soccer World Cup, 2018 APEC Summit and recently the Indian Prime Minister.”
“This should already give you a glimpse of what we are capable of doing as a city,” Governor Parkop said.
The visiting advance technical team also met with the Minister for Internal Security, Peter Tsiamalili Jnr who also gave assurance of the country’s security commitment towards the event.
“You have our full support in as far as security is concerned.”
“We have hosted many international events here in Port Moresby, and we will accord the same level of detail to the visiting delegates,” Minister Tsiamalili Jnr said.

UN Women reaffirms support,7/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3089,,Development,Trust,"James Marape, Jason Peter, Powes Parkop","UN Women Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific, Christine Arab, concluded a four-day visit to Papua New Guinea, reaffirming the organisation’s commitment to supporting the PNG Government’s leadership in advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment.
The visit took place between 28–31 January 2025, and strengthened partnerships with government officials, Members of Parliament, development partners, civil society organizations, youth organizations and grassroots women’s groups, celebrating PNG’s significant progress while addressing ongoing challenges.
During her meetings with Prime Minister James Marape and with Minister for Community Development, Youth, and Religion Jason Peter, Arab recognized the important investments PNG has made to tackle gender-based violence, increasing women-owned spaces for economic opportunities and enhancing national legal frameworks to ensure women’s equality.
Through discussions with women MPs and Ministers from the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, the visit also highlighted Bougainville’s Gender Equality, Women’s Empowerment, Peace, and Security Policy (2023–2027) as a major achievement in promoting women's leadership.
In partnership with the National Capital District Commission and Governor, Powes Parkop, and the New Zealand High Commission and High Commissioner Peter Zwart, Arab visited Gordon’s Market, a flagship women’s economic empowerment project.
With only 10 percent of women in PNG having access to formal financial services, the Gordon’s Market initiative is crucial in providing women vendors with sustainable economic opportunities, and in which women lead the market’s governance and administration.
Addressing gender-based violence, Arab emphasized the urgent need to strengthen survivor support systems, particularly as 68 percent of women in PNG experience GBV in their lifetime.
UN Women emphasized that they continue to work alongside the government to advance legal frameworks, community-based interventions, and capacity-building for service providers.
The establishment of the National GBV Secretariat was recognized as a crucial step forward in coordinating national response efforts.
This visit reaffirmed UN Women’s commitment to working in close partnership with the Government of Papua New Guinea to drive policy advancements, economic empowerment, and protection for women and girls. Through continued collaboration and strategic investments, UN Women remains dedicated to fostering lasting change for gender equality across PNG."

Yarti had been serving a 32-year sentence for willful murder when he escaped on March 27, 2024. His background as a police officer in Madang Province before committing the murder offense made him dangerous.
This experience likely equipped him with skills and knowledge that enabled him to evade capture for an extended period, raising concerns about his threat to the island communities. Police had received multiple reports of his presence, leading to efforts to relocate him.
After several unsuccessful attempts to recapture Yarti, fresh intelligence finally led authorities to discover that Yarti had traveled by boat from Bagbag Island to Karkar Island. Acting on this information, police tracked him down. Yarti was captured on January 31, when officers stopped a PMV truck and found him among the passengers.
Yarti is in police custody and will be taken to the Beon prison to complete his sentence.

Proud computer science student,5/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3066,,Education,Joy,Nill,"Clutching a white slip of paper containing the amount he was expected to pay, Gemmy Pyaki patiently waited with his helper under a marquee set up at the PNG University of Technology in Lae.
The first year student is finally able to register this year thanks to some changes made by Unitech to include students who are using wheelchairs.
Pyaki traveled down to Lae, from Enga Province, on Sunday, February 2nd, to make sure that he gets himself registered to begin his Bachelor of Science studies.
This is not his first time at the Taraka campus.
Pyaki had initially attempted to register at Unitech last year, but because the institution lacked inclusive facilities, he instead signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that ensured his return this year to a more conducive environment.
“Last year I wanted to start schooling but because they didn’t have inclusive facilities, they told me to go back and they will fix them so I can access my classes. That’s why I went back home,” said Pyaki, who hails from Birip village in Wabag. “This year, I aim to take computer science. This has always been my dream.
“I was in a car accident in 2016 and I suffered a spinal cord injury that resulted in an inability to move my arms and legs. I stayed home for some years until I could move my arms again. That was when the thought of holding a pen to write started burning in my mind.
“I sat for an entry exam and passed it, that’s why I’m here,” he proudly beamed.

“We’ve got a unit all done up for him with features added to help him settle in,” she outlined. “It’s built in a way that he can bring two helpers to help him while he’s here.
“We’ve also arranged for a wheelchair for him and we’ve got a team on the ground to help give him a bit of orientation; an orientation that is different from what the rest of the students undergo. It is to help him see which routes and footpaths he will take. Some of the changes we are seeing are for wheelchair access.
“He’s going to a department that has two floors so we have spoken to the department, so whatever classes that he will be in, they will bring them down to the ground floor.
“We will work through the situation and see what other things need to be done. But we are also working with partners outside to help us work with students like him so that we can give them the best experience.”"

The Legal Year was officially opened on Monday, February 3rd led by a parade hosted by the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary. The ceremony was witnessed by the legal fraternity led by judges of the supreme and national courts, chief magistrates, magistrates, lawyers and staff.
Niningi emphasized two important points that are affecting the legal system. They are delay of judgments and content of lawyers.
Sharing similar sentiments, Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika urged judges to produce results on time to ensure that justice is served and delivered on time.
“I admit that judges have been too slow in delivering justice. Deputy Chief Justice and I make efforts to ensure judges deliver judgment in a reasonable period but on many occasions, we failed to achieve those results,” he said.
Salika warned judges that a six-month strategy would be implemented to deliver a matter. If they do not deliver within six months, it may lead to the termination of their commission.
He also called on lawyers to assist the judges with the essential documents that are needed to fast-track the court process."

PMGH receives kidney transplant machines,4/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3057,,Health,Anticipation,Nill,"Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH) is set to make history by offering Papua New Guinea’s first kidney transplant service.
The breakthrough comes after the commissioning of two key machines, the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) and the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Device on January 31, 2025. These machines will eliminate the need to send blood samples overseas, improving efficiency and reducing costs.
The HLA machine is used for compatibility testing between donors and recipients, while the TDM machine monitors immunosuppressive drug levels post-transplant.
Speaking at the commissioning ceremony, Dr. Nora Dai, Acting Executive Manager for Medical Standards at the National Department of Health, praised PMGH’s progress.
“We are on the eve of the first kidney transplantation in the Pacific region. This is a momentous occasion, not just for Papua New Guinea but for the entire Pacific. We are proving that we can achieve what others thought was impossible,” she said.
PMGH Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Paki Molumi, acknowledged the National Fisheries Authority for its K10 million funding towards the kidney transplant program.
“By introducing a kidney transplant program, we can free patients from dialysis machines, allowing them to live a more economical and independent life,” Dr. Molumi said.
He further noted that the kidney transplant service would be extended to neighbouring Pacific nations, reducing the need for patients to travel to countries like Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines. This move, he said, aligns with the government’s vision of promoting medical tourism to boost the economy.
Dr. Molumi also highlighted the remaining challenge of finalising the kidney transplant policy and legal framework, with the aim of performing the first transplant as a Golden Jubilee gift to the people of Papua New Guinea."

The public machinery has not been able to perform its duties since commencing the working year, because of a lack of resources and logistics.
Constant pressure from district heads and authorities has forced the head of the public service in Madang, Frank Lau, to call on the Governor to recognize the urgency.
Deputy Governor, Corporate Service Dick Moiga said in the past couple of years, the budget process was hijacked by the Administration resulting in two sets of budgets being presented to Treasury. This has seen a tussle for the implementation of the budget and budget maintenance processes.
Furthermore, Mr. Moiga stated that the budget is the bloodline for service delivery and it would be detrimental to the people of Madang if services are not rendered as anticipated.
David Turik the Planning Director emphasized maintaining system processes and governance for effective service delivery.
According to the three, the last lot of Form 11 claims from 2024 are yet to be signed by the Governor. The provincial administration hopes this will not be repeated this year against service providers.
Attempts to get the Governor’s comments at the time of writing this report, were unsuccessful. Office staff confirmed he is out of town and unreachable."

Deputy Commissioner and Chief of Administration, Dr. Philip Mitna made this remark at the groundbreaking ceremony for 10 new duplexes at Mirane Barracks in Chimbu Province on Friday, January 31st.
DCP Mitna said the Constabulary will build new houses because much of its existing barracks across the country were rundown. One of the primary hindrances to the government initiative is land ownership issues.
“We are ambitious but we are also disappointed after encountering some customary landowner issues along the way, Dr Mitna said.
“The alternative option is to demolish the old and existing houses and construct new buildings.""
""The RPNGC is deeply grateful for the vision and foresight of the Government for allocating direct funding through the Special Police Assistance Program (SPAP), to build and rehabilitate police accommodation throughout the country.""
""We will rehabilitate and build according to the RPNGC standardized building designs, which include brick and steel so the infrastructures can withstand the elements of nature and last for many years, which subsequently minimizes maintenance.”
He said our policemen and policewomen deserve to live in improved barracks accommodation so they can reciprocate the good gesture by putting more effort and commitment into their duties and responsibilities.
“The biggest challenge affecting the RPNGC is the police-to-population ratio. As we continue to increase police numbers through recruitment, we are concurrently focused on improving living conditions, adequately resourcing and properly attiring our members. We have embarked on these programs, much of them would not be possible if it were not for the direct government funding through SPAP,” Dr Mitna."

Hunters to pick final team after trials,2/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3042,,Sports,Anticipation,Nill,"Following months of grueling preseason training, the SP PNG Hunters will be hosting their first trial matches this week to assess the progress of its players.
Assistant head coach, Enoch Maki said the trials will be an opportunity for the new Hunters to prove themselves whether they deserve spots in the final 30-men squad.
""We are having our first trial on Friday, 7th February, with Hela Wigmen and Central Dabaris. We are going to select one team; mostly new boys and we see how they go,” said Maki.
He said this would be the first trial for the boys. There will be a second trial which is crucial in selecting the final Hunters team.
""At the end of our second trial against the Central Queensland Carpas, we should be sure of our team for the first round of the competition.""
One of the issues now is the lack of leadership in the team. The Hunters will be without key players, Judah Rimbu and Joshua Lau. Rimbu has signed up his services with the English Super League, and Lau is down with injury.
Despite these losses, Maki believes some brilliant players in the camp are versatile and can cover multiple positions and he is counting on them.
""Our spine, especially with Josh Lau injured and young Felix Beki not 100 percent fit coming back from injury, but there's some good guys in the team.
""Sany Wabo can play multiple positions which is very good. He can play fullback, halves, even hooker. He's very good. We are happy to see how he goes and Morea Junior can play a few other positions as well.""
The assistant coach also threw in the name of versatile Clent Lama who provided a utility role to the team in the 2024 campaign. Maki said Lama is another of those players he plays in multiple positions and still gets the job done.
The Hunters, under coach Paul Aiton and assistant Maki, reached the preliminary final for the first time in the last five seasons. The duo will be looking to go one better this season."

When expressing his condolences on the passing of Sir Julius Chan, at the launch of the 50th anniversary in Port Moresby recently. The Prime Minister strongly urged young people to learn from these great leaders and lead the country forward.
“Who would have thought 50 years ago the fathers and the mothers of our country to have a dream? They dared to dream big. They dreamt of a united country which made the diversity we had and dreamt of a people charting their destiny.
“They dreamt of a sovereign country, and in 1975, the young, mostly not equipped with the university degrees that we have today came together and forged the most diverse nation into one sovereignty we have today.
“There were fights that you never saw and tears that you never saw. There were moments of struggle that you were not part of that construct the freedom of this country that these great men made.”
Marape stressed that the country’s forefathers have done their part and it is now this generation of leaders to unite the country and carry on their legacy.
“They have passed on this country to us, and it is our business. As soon as they pass it on to us, it is our business to pass it on as a United Progressive nation into the future.
“Our economy must grow and no child must be left behind.
“Everyone must have access to money and healthcare. And everyone must respect each other. Those were the dreams of Sir Julius. Those were the dreams of Sir Michael Somare.”
“What is it that you must do to appreciate those who forged this unity and went before us? Marape challenged the current young leaders.
He reiterated that this generation must not squander the opportunity for us to construct a better future for this country.
“John FK once told his country, ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. It is not a hard ask. It is easy to ask what you can do for your country. The country is not abstract. Not a concept, but it is a living organ, a body that stands to call for those of us who said to set better be 100 percent committed to the cause.”

Wingti praised Sir Julius for his integrity, discipline, and exceptional leadership qualities.
He highlighted Sir Julius’ ability to discuss policy issues with a no-nonsense approach while also considering different perspectives and acting as a devil’s advocate. He said Sir Julius was a leader of leaders.

Wingti fondly recalled the open and honest nature of their relationship, built on mutual respect and trust. He emphasized the importance of such a relationship in effective leadership, contrasting it with the current political climate where leaders are less open to constructive criticism.
“Sir Julius’ era of leadership was unique and irreplaceable,” Wingti said.
“His ability to tell leaders the hard truths, even when it was uncomfortable, was essential for running a country efficiently.”
Wingti expressed his deep respect and gratitude for Sir Julius, acknowledging his significant impact on many lives, including his own.

Sir Chris said the nation has lost one of the last three surviving founding father, just eight months shy of PNG’s 50th anniversary.
“On behalf of the people of the Gulf Province, my provincial assembly, my tribe and the Toaripi tribe where Sir Julius was a co-operative officer at kukup in his early years, I take this time to express my utmost sympathy on the passing of a great iconic leader of Papua New Guinea,” said Sir Chris Haiveta.
“I offer my sincere condolences to Lady Chan, the children and their families. May you find solace and comfort in God at this time of mourning and know that your father has run a mighty race and it is the journey that has been meaningful to each of us in many ways, for which we are eternally grateful.
“As I mourn the passing of Sir Julius, a very close colleague and mentor, I also reflect on his journey from pre-independence to independence then to the present day.
“He was the father and economic architect of the modern post colonial state of PNG. He established most of the institutions that run and regulate the economic and commercial infrastructure of Papua New Guinea.
His Marist boarding college, and Co-operative officer background, training and experience served him well throughout life.
Frugal and sharp, he could uncannily cut through economic jargon and administrative “gobble degook” and  identify savings or an easier and more practical way of doing things. Forever the wiser pragmatist, in politics he was a master strategist of the highest order, playing his steady deck of 4 to 6 MPs and his stature, coming out twice as Deputy Prime Minister to Wingti and twice as Prime Minister unseating Somare and Wingti in his heyday.
Punctuality and comportment and good manners were important in day to day affairs of the state, be they meetings, formal and informal or Ministerial NEC meetings. As a bureaucrat he was a hard taskmaster but a pleasure to work with.10 am meant 10 am with 100 % attendance not 10 past 10 am with 99% attendance.
“Late Sir Julius and I go a long way back when he was the prime minister and I was Secretary Gulf in the 80s and later as Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in the mid 90s. Together, we faced challenges, recorded successes and set up institutions that have added value, all for the good of our people and  this nation.”
At times, we found our selves on opposite sides of the House but our tight bond in  personal relationships have remained until the end with our lines open to each other all times.
He was a man of his word. A true friend.
“Farewell Sir J, rest easy now as you have played your game well for us all. For today we remember you. Your legacy lives on. May you rest in peace."""

(“Yes we understand his WILL is already out and his children are taking about it. But we as a country including me, the Prime Minister and the Members of Parliament feel that we have to give him some recognition,” said Pomat.)
Prime Minister James Marape  in passing his government’s condolences to the family of Sir Julius also highlighted Sir J’s role in setting the financial system of the country.
“We want to thank the people of Namatanai and New Ireland for gifting him to Papaua New Guinea -  one exceptional leader who was the architecture of our nation’s financial structure we have today. As our nation’s first Finance Minister, he birthed the concept called Kina an Toea into our national currency. He was instrumental in the birth of the Central Bank and its independence that exists up to today. We acknowledge his passing. God giveth and God rests in each of our own individual timeline and for him, it was yesterday,” Marape said.
In sharing the same views as the speaker, Marape said the national week of mourning will be observed once the final program is out but encouraged all schools, business houses, government organisations and all citizens to pay their respect when a formal announcement of the exact date is made.
“I want to send a word to his clan, his people and his tribe in Namatanai in New Ireland, together with his immediate familt that he dies in office as Governor of New Ireland Province and he was an active Member of Parliament. The speaker as  the boss of parliament has  the oversight  into what takes place even at passing of an elected member of parliament.
“From the National Government’s perspective, we’re declaring a one week period of mourning and the country’s flag, wherever it is flown will remain half-mast for one week.
“In the meantime, whenever the important dates of announcement when the parliament pays respect, we will require schools not to be in class in that hour or two and we will require all employers to ask their people, their employees not to be at work. They will be at work but in that one hour or two, watch the livestream or broadcast.”
He also announced that a day of national mourning will be held on Sunday at the Sir John guise Indoor Complex.
Meantime, the body of Sir J arrived from New Ireland today and is kept at the Funeral Home."
