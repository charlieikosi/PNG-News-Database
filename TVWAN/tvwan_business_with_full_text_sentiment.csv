ExxonMobil Empowers Future Women Engineers,28/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6615,"In a bid to reshape futures and foster new possibilities for young women in Papua New Guinea, ExxonMobil PNG Limited (EMPNG) recently brought together 75 exceptional grade-nine girls from five Port Moresby schools for its second annual “Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day”.
Held at the LNG Plant in Caution Bay, the event ran under the guiding theme “Design Your Future”, inviting participants to engage in hands-on science experiments, collaborative problem-solving, and direct mentorship from Papua New Guinean engineers. The schools represented included Gordon Secondary School, Charles Lwanga Secondary School, Jubilee Catholic Secondary School, Bavaroko Junior High School, and Ororo Junior High School.
EMPNG Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh Sivasamboo visited the practical work stations and praised the girls enthusiasm, noting, “Even though you’ve come from different schools, you have quickly made new friends and learned to work together effectively as a team to solve real world problems. These are important skills that will help you excel in your lives and your careers.”
Speaking to the prospects ahead, Sivasamboo added, “Papua New Guinea’s energy future looks quite bright, so there will be opportunities for students like you throughout our industry. I hope you will continue to apply yourselves to your studies so that you might join us as engineers one day.”
Throughout the day, the 42 employee volunteers from EMPNG’s Women in Energy Network guided the students through key engineering concepts from circuit boards and electrical engineering to structural problem solving encouraging them to imagine and design their own futures in STEM.
For many of the young participants, the experience proved transformative. Zillar Naku Pa’aka from Gordon Secondary reflected, “I didn’t think much about taking on engineering, but after today, I might have a change of mind.”
And Sylvia Mero of Jubilee Catholic added, “I enjoyed the electrical engineering activity with the circuit boards. When the lights lit up, it felt like it lit something in me. I think after today, I’d like to become an engineer.”
The programme concluded with a lunch at the Plant’s site mess, and a gift pack for each girl, reinforcing the message that the journey into engineering can start today.
ExxonMobil PNG emphasises that this initiative is more than a one-day event—it is part of a broader commitment to STEM education and empowering girls to take bold steps into fields where they have been historically under-represented. Earlier versions of the parent programme show its roots in global efforts to close the gender gap in engineering.
As Papua New Guinea seeks to diversify its workforce and harness local talent in energy and infrastructure sectors, such outreach efforts carry not just educational but national significance. For these 75 girls, the spark lit at Caution Bay might well become the foundation of tomorrow’s PNG-based engineers.","Education, Joy",Education,Joy
Rabaul boasts new infrastructure,26/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6588,"A series of infrastructure projects in Rabaul District, in East New Britain Province, have been completed recently.
Rabaul District Administrator, Freddy Lemeki, said these projects are the Watom sea wall upgrade and extension, Second 22nd Street road works and repair, Tunnel Hill road works and repair and Toleap Reinforced Concrete Box Culvert (RCBC).
The second phase of Blanche Street major rehabilitation is 60 percent completed.
He said these projects are funded through the District Services Improvement Program (DSIP) and Provincial Services Improvement Program (PSIP), and are expected to bring much-needed upgrades to roads in Rabaul town and the sea wall at Watom LLG.
Lemeki said the upgrade and extension on the 80-metre sea wall is built in front of the Vunakabai government station at Watom LLG.
This area had been badly affected by the rise in sea level, causing erosion on coastal areas. The government station was also affected.
The sea wall project is funded under DSIP and constructed by Senuak Contractors, taking four months to complete.
Lemeki said the major rehabilitation of Blanche Street (PSIP/DSIP counter fund), second 22nd Street (DSIP) and Tunnel Hill road (DSIP/PSIP counter fund) projects all undertaken by Nivani Ltd will improve the transportation network in Rabaul. These projects, valued at K4.9 million, K876,000 and K2.2 million respectively, will reduce travel times, improve road safety and boost economic activity.
The Toleap RCBC (DSIP) recently completed by Senuak Contractors and worth K373,862.50 now addresses past problems faced by commuters during heavy rains and erosion.
In September this year, Rabaul District witnessed the commissioning of the second phase Blanche Street Rehabilitation, second 22nd Street works and repair, Tunnel Hill road works and repair and Toleap RCBC.
Lemeki said the district will continue to prioritise infrastructure development both in the civil and building sectors.","Local, Trust",Local,Trust
LDC Taps Local Expertise for Asset Valuation,25/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6583,"The Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) is charting a bold investment path for Papua New Guinea’s livestock industry through a nationwide asset valuation project that is set to redefine how its public assets are leveraged for economic growth.
This pathway falls in line with LDC’s efforts to provide sound feedback to the government after a directive that came from the Prime Minister dated 17th March 2020, for a campaign involving reclamation and refurbishment in taking stock of all government owned assets under LDC.
On Thursday 23rd of October 2025, during a signing ceremony, Chairman of LDC Board of Directors, Martin Ginyaru, said the Government has spent substantial amounts on the reclamation program, and the onus is on the valuers to provide a report back for the purpose of transparency and good governance.
LDC has engaged five reputable local asset valuation companies from a total of 11 applicants who responded to a public advertisement in the media.
The internal procurement committee chaired by LDC Finance Manager, Otto Wangillen selected
those companies based on merit, given their wide experiences and local knowledge of the real estate market across PNG.
The Valuers are tasked with conducting a comprehensive value assessment of LDC’s cattle ranches, abattoirs, and state – owned land under LDC across the country.
The decision to engage independent local valuers was made by the LDC Board of Directors to ensure this valuation process would not only restore operational clarity but also form the backbone of LDC’s investment forecast and development strategy.
“Valuation is not just a technical requirement, it is our launchpad for investment” said Ginyaru.
He further added that engaging local valuators ensures that the process is not only technically sound but also grounded in local knowledge and accountability. This is a critical step in transforming underutilized assets into viable investment platforms,” he further added.
The valuers, drawn from across PNG are tasked with conducting valuation on LDC’s extensive portfolio of properties and assets. Their work is central to the government’ asset valuation campaign, which aims to boost investor confidence, improve transparency, and lay the groundwork for public-private partnerships.
The asset valuation exercise will provide the transparency and credibility needed to structure investment-ready proposals. With clear asset records, LDC can now offer investors a portfolio of viable opportunities backed by verified data and government support.
Furthermore, the valuation initiative is part of PNG’s Medium-Term Development Plan IV 2023–2027, which targets self-sufficiency in meat production by 2030.
By quantifying the value and potential of its livestock infrastructure, LDC is positioning itself as a catalyst for agribusiness growth and rural development.
The valuation project is set to cost at least K500,000 in total and is expected to be concluded before the end of 2025.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

A team from the BSP Dobel Branch in Mt Hagen visited Ponowi Primary School at the invite of the school head teacher, Siro Yoko.
Mr Yoko came up with this initiative to help students develop a saving culture while still small and assist them to nurture this mindset as they progress in life.
BSP Dobel Branch Manager, Imson Kasu was impressed with the turnout. What he expected to be an account opening exercise for school children turned into account opening for a whole community.
He said this is part of BSP’s “go rural” campaign, bringing services to where it matters.
“This is part of BSP’s strategy, targeting customers while also carrying out awareness about services we provide, all for the convenience of customers.
“The bank encourages us to carry out activities like this as it helps to address issues faced by customers in opening bank accounts, card replacement, and other services by bringing these services to their door steps.”
He stressed the importance of involving school children in this exercise as it’ll go a long way.
School children’s accounts were created under the “Sumatin Account” category which is fee-free while the rest of the community also had the chance to have new accounts opened while those with existing accounts but had issues with their cards had them replaced.

Pacific Nations Called to Own Tuna Value Chain,18/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6488,"Pacific Island countries are being urged to take greater control of their fisheries value chain, particularly in tuna, as part of new initiatives led by Papua New Guinea’s Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Authority.
Speaking at Day 2 of the Pacific Tuna Forum 2025, Dr Lawrence Sause, SEZ Chairperson and Executive Dean of the UPNG School of Business & Public Policy, highlighted the opportunities and challenges facing Pacific fisheries.
“Some of the facts are so startling to me, and the challenge of course is what do we do with them. But I think the two most important facts that we should be comforted with is that in the Pacific we are the owners of some of the largest fisheries stocks in the world including tuna,” Dr Sause said.
He emphasised the problem of limited local control over the value chain, noting that much of the downstream processing is done outside the Pacific. “We are not in control of the value chain of the fisheries and the value chain for the processing of tuna and the end product of it in the Pacific. Others are in control of it and those in control of it get the most out of it,” he explained.
Dr Sause also presented the East New Britain Initiative (ENBi), a concept encouraging joint investment among Pacific Island countries to expand processing and finished product development in PNG. The SEZ framework provides financial and non-financial incentives to attract investors and fast-track development.
“In the Pacific, nobody will come and build the Pacific for us in our countries we ourselves must build it… If we wait on others we will wait for another fifty years and we will just be onlookers of the world,” he said.
The ENBi is part of what Dr Sause calls the “Broom strategy,” highlighting the strength of collaboration across nations: “A broom by itself as a broomstick is not strong… but collectively if you put all the broomsticks together it becomes a solid piece of tool that you can use.”
PNG has already issued licenses to four SEZs, attracting investments totaling K2.7 billion, with opportunities in fisheries, tourism, steel, cement, and other sectors. Dr Sause urged regional cooperation and cross-border SEZ development to ensure Pacific nations fully benefit from their tuna resources.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
K92 commissions stage three expansion plant,17/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6478,"The Kainantu Mine (K92) commissioned its stage three processing plant yesterday. It’s expected to produce 1.2 million tonnes of minerals, including gold and silver per annum, an associate paste plant, and other infrastructure to support its expansion plans.
Paste plants are essential in mining operations for producing paste backfill. The paste backfill mixture, which contains additives like cement, is then pumped back into underground voids or holes left by mining activities, to provide structural support to minimize the risk of collapses.
Prime Minister James Marape unveiled a plaque to officially commission the plant.
The mine employs nearly 1,800 employees and contractors, and is a significant tax contributor to the country, with some K243.4 million in taxes and royalties paid to the state.
With the stage three plant commissioning, they aim to contribute around K378 million in taxes to the government.
K92 Chief Executive Officer John Lewins said that the mine is planning to deliver positive results and transition into a tier-one gold mining company.
“As we celebrate the commissioning of the plant, we are also celebrating the tier-one gold mine here in PNG,” he said. “It’s a combination of many years of investment in Kainautu, many years of investment in exploration, multiple stages of exploration, and, more importantly, financial investment in the people of Papua New Guinea.”
The CEO thanked the government, Mineral Resource Authority (MRA), stakeholders, provincial government, landowners, and the community for their support in contributing to the growth of the mine for the past ten years.
Mr Marape said K92, in terms of paying tax, is leading also – it’s right behind New Porgera and Ok Tedi.
Those who attended the event included the mining minister Rainbo Paita, Kainantu MP William Hagahuno, the Australian High Commission to PNG Ewen McDonald, the mining board, MRA representatives, landowners, employees, and the community.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
Ok Tedi & NEA sign LTW MoA,17/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6473,"Ok Tedi Mining Limited (Ok Tedi) and the National Energy Authority (NEA) have a signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) to advance the Lighting Up the West (LTW) initiative, a transformative program aimed at expanding access to reliable, affordable, and clean energy across Western, West Sepik, and East Sepik Provinces.
The MoA, signed by Ok Tedi Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Kedi Ilimbit, and NEA Managing Director Ronald Meketa, establishes a framework for regulatory cooperation, licensing, and stakeholder engagement to deliver rural electrification through decentralised renewable energy (DRE) solutions in the short-to medium-term, and hydropower in the long-term.
Ilimbit said: “The Lighting Up the West initiative is a cornerstone of our Growth 2050 Energy Transition strategy, and this MoA with NEA marks a major step toward delivering clean, reliable electric power to communities across the Western Province and beyond.”
The initiative aligns with Papua New Guinea’s national goal to achieve 70% electricity access by 2030 and 100% by 2050, prioritizing renewable energy sources such as solar and hydro.
Ok Tedi, through its subsidiary Ok Tedi Power, will champion the deployment of DRE solutions to anchor communities, with feasibility studies underway in Western, West Sepik, and East Sepik Provinces.
The program is designed to deliver social, economic, and environmental benefits, including improved quality of life, local enterprise development, reduced emissions, and enhanced energy independence.
This partnership underscores Ok Tedi’s commitment to responsible mining and energy transition, and NEA’s mandate to support inclusive, sustainable electrification for all Papua New Guineans.","Energy, Anticipation",Energy,Anticipation
Historic move into commercial fisheries,16/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6464,"National Fisheries Authority (NFA) Managing Director Justin Ilakini has outlined Papua New Guinea’s bold plans to strengthen its fisheries sector and take a historic step into commercial activity.
Speaking at a press conference during the Pacific Tuna Forum 2025 in Nadi, Fiji, Ilakini detailed reforms that aim to benefit both the nation and local communities dependent on coastal and inland fisheries.
“After three readings in parliament and once that authorization bill is passed, for the first time in our history, the state will have an interest in a commercial space,” he said. “And that’s what where third entity will be talking business with everybody in the region.”
Ilakini said this move will allow PNG to actively participate in fisheries ventures, while the NFA continues its regulatory role. The reforms are part of a broader strategy to retain more value domestically, empower small-scale fishers, and encourage regional collaboration.
He also highlighted the Eastern and North Bismarck Initiative (ENBi) as a key framework to unite Pacific Island countries, promoting inclusive investment, shared initiatives, and sectoral development.
“There is this misconception about the ENBi,” he said. “ENBi is not a project; it is a development framework — a framework to encourage innovative and inclusive investment pathways, to discourage people or countries from working in isolation, and to bring your strengths to the table and let’s work together.”
“That’s basically what ENBi aims to do and also promotes member-driven initiatives and sectoral approach to development,” he added.
Ilakini emphasised that PNG has already created 12,000 direct jobs and close to 20,000 including indirect employment in the tuna industry, with more expected as commercial operations expand.
He also reflected on the forum itself.
“What’s going to happen next is that, for me, I’m really excited about this particular forum
“What is different about this forum is it’s more focused on us now.
“What are we doing? The data are showing that most of the fish is now being processed offshore but those fish are caught from our region.
“This forum shows that the reforms we are rolling back home are working,” he said.
The Managing Director said the reforms and ENBi framework reflect the government’s broader goal to broaden coastal and inland fisheries, support livelihoods, and drive economic growth, while positioning PNG as a leader in sustainable regional fisheries and regional cooperation.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Ilakini Reveals IUU Measures,16/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6462,"Following the Pacific Tuna Forum 2025 in Nadi, Fiji, Justin Ilakini highlighted Papua New Guinea’s initiatives to combat Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, alongside other reforms aimed at maximizing economic and community benefits from fisheries.
On jobs and industry growth, Ilakini said, “Okay, both indirectly and directly close to 20,000 jobs but directly we have created 12,000 jobs from the tuna industry.”
“But the potential to create more jobs is there, we are really working hard to get there.
“That number will definitely increase when Maggies Seafood is opening up for business again early next year,” he said.
“Over the last couple of years as a region, we were able to cut back on IUU activities, but at the national level, we have built surveillance capabilities.
“For the first time in our history, we are bringing in four surveillance boats…We’ll have one at Vanimo, one at Daru, and these are already coming.
“Forward bases, such as the one in Daru, will coordinate efforts with Indonesian authorities, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, and PNG agencies, strengthening surveillance across PNG’s 2 million square kilometre EEZ,” he said.
He also updated on ICT reforms that will improve near real-time reporting to reduce unreported activities among licensed vessels.
Ilakini explained that the ENBi framework is enabling PNG and other Pacific nations to engage in commercial initiatives, such as the Pacific Island Tuna (PIT) initiative, which connects fishers directly to markets like Walmart, removing the middleman and increasing regional revenue.
Reflecting on the forum itself, Ilakini said, “I thought it was really good. Our leaders and ministers want real tangible outcomes, not just talk and carrying out studies.”
“Yesterday’s discussions go to show that when we come together and start working together, we can start to realise tangible outcomes,” he said.
Other highlights from the forum included:
•	Transitioning the East New Britain initiatives from study to now implementation stages.
•	Strengthening coastal and inland fisheries for rural livelihoods.
•	Policy reforms requiring 25–35% of tuna catch to be landed in PNG, boosting domestic processing.
•	Confirming that PNG’s reforms are already attracting investment, with boats lining up to offload in Lae and Madang for the first time in decades.
Ilakini stressed that regional cooperation through ENBi is critical moving forward, enabling Pacific Island countries to maximize economic benefits from their fisheries while ensuring sustainable growth and community impact.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
9th Pacific Tuna Forum 2025 underway,14/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6435,"The 9th Pacific Tuna Forum (PTF 2025) has officially opened today in Nadi, Fiji, bringing together regional leaders, fisheries experts, and industry stakeholders to chart a sustainable and inclusive path for the future of the Pacific’s tuna industry.
Held at the Sofitel Fiji Resort and Spa from October 14 and 15, the two-day event runs under the theme “Pacific Tuna 2050: Resilience, Innovation, Equity and Sustainable Trade for a Prosperous Future.” It is jointly organised by the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry of Fiji, Papua New Guinea’s National Fisheries Authority (NFA), and INFOFISH, with support from key regional and international partners.
The Western and Central Pacific Ocean produces nearly 60 percent of the world’s tuna supply, placing Pacific Island nations at the heart of the global tuna industry. Beyond its economic value, the tuna sector underpins food security, employment, and sustainable livelihoods across the Blue Pacific.
At PTF 2025, leaders are discussing how to secure greater value retention and fairer benefit-sharing for Pacific nations while ensuring that tuna stocks remain healthy for future generations. The forum aims to strengthen regional cooperation in tackling illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, improving traceability, and building resilience against climate change and global market disruptions.
Participants will explore practical strategies under four core themes — resilience, innovation, equity, and sustainable trade. Sessions will address a range of pressing issues, including sustainable tuna resources and supply chains, investment through the “Hubs and Spokes” model, and the future of global and regional tuna markets.
Innovation will take center stage as delegates discuss how technology and digital solutions can drive transparency, efficiency, and long-term sustainability. The forum also places strong emphasis on equity — ensuring that Pacific communities, particularly women and youth, benefit from opportunities across the tuna value chain.
Chaired by Dr. Manumatavai Tupou-Roosen, Acting Deputy Vice-Chancellor for Regional Campuses and Global Engagements at the University of the South Pacific, the forum’s opening ceremony was officiated by Viliame Gavoka, Fiji’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation.
Other notable speakers include Papua New Guinea’s Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources, Jelta Wong, and INFOFISH Acting Director, Gemma Meermans Matainaho. Experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization, the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), the Pacific Community, and the Marine Stewardship Council are also contributing their expertise.
The diverse line-up underscores the global relevance of Pacific fisheries and the shared commitment to ensure their sustainability. Discussions will not only assess the health of tuna stocks but also explore pathways for value creation, certification standards, and responsible trade practices.
As part of the broader 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, PTF 2025 represents a key step in advancing a united regional approach to fisheries governance. Organisers hope the forum will foster stronger partnerships between governments, industry players, and communities, aligning economic growth with environmental stewardship.
“The Pacific tuna industry is central to our shared prosperity and our global responsibility,” said Dr. Tupou-Roosen in her opening remarks. “Through resilience, innovation, equity, and sustainable trade, we can secure a prosperous future for the Blue Pacific Continent and the world.”

The Lae Seif Komuniti Trenspot Initiative, a collaboration between the Business Coalition for Women and Tok Stret Consulting, is emphasising that everyone needs to take responsibility to help create a safe bus, a safe public space, and a safe community.
A report by UN Women outlined that harassment is common in public spaces like markets and on public transport.
And with the current situation in the country, not even men and youth are safe from harassment and petty crimes.
“During that time, I contacted Julianne Terry from Tok Stret Consulting to see if they could partner with us because they’re already based in Lae,” said BCfW executive director, Evonne Kennedy, during a networking event hosted in Lae on the evening of Friday, October 10th.
“The Business Coalition for Women, of which I am the executive director, is predominantly based in Port Moresby.
“What we’ve been trying to do since that study in 2019 was establish a working group. We established that working group in 2022.
“In those early days, we were trying to identify how the private sector can contribute to creating safer transport, safer bus stops and public spaces in general.”
Through the Lae working group, several initiatives were implemented, including education awareness with bus crew and youth, the installation of CCTV cameras around identified bus stops, the installation of CCTV monitoring equipment in the Lae Top Town police station and radio awareness campaigns.
“We are proud that after three years, this project has come to fruition,” stated Terry, the owner and manager of Tok Stret Consulting.
“What’s at the forefront is the safety of our people, more so, our women, children and school kids who access our bus stops.
“Today, we are proud to say that we have installed six cameras in the main bus stops of Lae city.
“Just installing the cameras doesn’t mean that we have achieved what we wanted to achieve. There’s still a lot of work to do in the background.
“As a Lae resident, we need your partnership to make the cameras work plus we will need a better internet service provider to make sure that the cameras are working with the Royal PNG Constabulary so we can take it to the next level.”","Community, Trust",Community,Trust

JS Coffee Exports 10 Tons,10/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6384,"A local coffee business, JS Coffee, is making waves by securing a deal to export a significant amount of coffee outside of Papua New Guinea (PNG). The company, owned by former politician John Simon, has sent more than 10 tons of already roasted and packaged coffee to the Philippines today.
This important move is expected to encourage more people in rural areas to grow coffee.
The former Minister for Agriculture has been looking for international buyers for JS roasted coffee and coffee in its raw form (parchment). After talks with buyers overseas, Mr. Simon is traveling there today with the large shipment of the products.
One major problem for local coffee growers in PNG is the constantly changing price of coffee beans, which can cause financial hardship. Mr. Simon emphasized that PNG businesses must focus on selling their coffee ""to the cup."" This means they need to sell it directly to international buyers who want high-quality beans, and then properly roast, grind, and market the product to build a strong customer base.
JS Coffee currently buys its beans from farmers in Jiwaka and the Sepik. The company's goal is to offer better prices for both Robusta and Arabica coffee in these regions.
He’s called on the government to continue programs that support coffee prices and offer freight support like shipping costs so that farmers get a fair and reasonable price for their hard work.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Agreement established for Madang’s coconut processing plant,10/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6379,"A Joint venture agreement was between the Department of International Trade and Investment, Madang Provincial Government, and Kokonas Indastri Koporesen with Sir Lankan company Jaindi Exports Pvt Limited to create a new coconut processing plant in Madang Province.
This agreement was reached during a two-day visit of the Minister for International Trade and Investment and his trade delegation to Sri Lanka.
The delegation included the Governor for Madang, Ramsey Pariwa, Secretary for the Department of International Trade and Investment, Jacinta Warakai-Manua, and Managing Director for KIK, Alan Aku.
A customary event was hosted by Jaindi Exports, which included a Sri Lankan cultural performance, lighting of an oil lamp, and planting of two coconut trees in their Navik Mills to seal the new relationship.
This new partnership will see the establishment of a major coconut processing plant in Madang to produce high-end coconut products on the 20-hectare land owned by the Madang Provincial Government at Siar along the North Coast Road on the outskirts of Madang.
“This project will transform the entire coconut industry in PNG. Laboring to make copra and selling to copra mills to produce crude coconut oil will be a thing of the past. Our farmers will harvest and sell the coconuts to the proposed processing plant, where all parts of the coconut, including the fibrous husk, the hard shell, the white edible flesh, and the liquid coconut water, will all be processed into finished products for our domestic market and export under global brand names.”
“There will be less labour, the farmers will make more money, and we will stop creating jobs for other countries from the exports of our crude oil.
“The global coconut demand has increased from US$15 billion in 2015 to US$40 billion in 2025 and is expected to increase to US$60 billion in 2030. Jaindi Exports is struggling to meet the local and the increasing global demand of their products and looking to expand to PNG to meet growing demand,” said Minister Maru.
It was agreed that the State will own 51 percent shares and Jaindi will own 49 percent in this project.
“The expected cost for the proposed project is K100 million. The State will put down K50 million equity contribution from our State Equity Funding from the 2025 PIP Budget. Our equity contribution is ready and we are ready to start this project.” Maru said.
Managing Director for KIK, Mr. Aku said: “From our census report, Madang has 3 million coconuts and can produce up to 206 million nuts a year. That is the primary reason why we will be setting up the proposed processing plant in Madang. If this project is successful, then we will be looking to build more coconut processing plants in other parts of the country, especially in East New Britain and in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.”
Minister Maru will be taking a submission to the NEC, seeking approval for the proposed JV and for a concept approval of a new Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to be called the “Siar SEZ” in Madang.
“The proposed coconut processing plant will be located within this new SEZ. This SEZ will be an industrial park and will be different from Madang Integrated SEZ which is specifically for the fishing industry,” explained Minister Maru.
Minister Maru extended an invitation to the Founder and Managing Director of Jaindi Exports, Mr. K.M Sampath Anuruddha, and his executives to visit the site in Madang and to firm up the new partnership. They are expected to arrive in PNG on October 20 to visit Port Moresby and Madang.
Governor Pariwa said is excited to see this project kicked off as soon as possible.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Ok Tedi completes project to manage mine water,09/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6363,"Mining is not just about digging the earth to extract ore – it involves a lot of engineering work to carry out operations safely and successfully, meeting their everyday targets.
Managing water in the pits is a challenge mining companies face every day. For Ok Tedi Mining Limited (Ok Tedi), Mt Fubilan where the giant Ok Tedi Mine sits receive 10,000mm of rain annually and the company after operating more than 40 years found a way to manage excess water in the pits.
They successfully completed the construction of a critical underground pump station project, that will improve mine water management, enhance safety, and save significant costs.
The project started in August 2024 and was completed in June 2025 without any incident and below its projected cost, saving the company USD$1.2 million.
The pump station is designed to manage increased volumes of rainwater discharged into the mine pit through mine shafts and depressurization holes. The system now channels this water through 800mm polypipes stretching 3.2 kilometres from the underground tunnel to the surface entrance, where the water is safely discharged into the river system. This engineering solution creates a safe and dry working environment for underground crews, leading to continuous productivity and improved conditions.
The successful delivery of this complex project involved the collaboration of three contractors Tabubil Engineering (TE), the Major Project Electrical Team, and Milum Services Limited (Milum) -who worked closely with over 40 Ok Tedi underground mining crew members, including the Wokman Teleoks Limited (WTL) embedded contract miners.

Their discussion will centre on how both national companies are working in unison to deliver the Prime Minister’s Reset PNG@50 agenda - a bold call to action to “reset” the nation’s economic machinery, align State enterprises, and drive true nation building through resource-led growth.
The Reset PNG vision calls for a results-based public sector and real partnerships between Government and State-Owned Enterprises.
Together, KPHL and KMHL are responding to that challenge by coordinating projects, streamlining procurement, and aligning national infrastructure plans to ensure every kina invested delivers measurable impact.
“Reset PNG is about action, not talk,” said Dr Liria. “For KPHL and KMHL, it means working as one team to turn resource potential into national prosperity. Be it from energy and minerals to communities and provinces.”
Mr Kanu added, “When these two companies move together, the outcome is multiplied. We share the same belief that PNG’s resources belong to its people, and our job is to ensure they see and feel the benefit.”
Beyond the policy talk, this fireside will also offer something rare: a deep dive and an inside look at the personalities and values of the two men leading PNG’s resource flagships.
•	Dr Luke Liria, known for his calm, analytical approach, brings academic precision and community empathy to corporate leadership. A believer in stability, he focuses on good governance, transparency, and national capacity building.
•	Mr Sarimu Kanu, an engineer by training and reformer by instinct, is driven by integrity, operational discipline, and a passion for empowering local participation. He is known for getting things done quietly but decisively.

businesses and partners can expect when dealing with them, offering an intimate
view of leadership at the highest level of PNG’s State enterprises.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Sri Lankan firm keen to invest in Madang’s coconut industry,07/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6340,"Jaindi Exports Pvt Limited, a Sri Lankan large-scale coconut-based food and beverages manufacturer/exporter, has recently expressed interest in setting up a coconut processing plant in Madang Province under a joint arrangement with local investors.
Following their interest, the Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, accompanied by the Madang Governor, Ramsey Pariwa visited Sri Lanka recently to see the company’s operation.
Jaindi Exports has two processing plants in Sri Lanka and, under the brand name ‘Econutrena’. They offer a diversified product portfolio, ranging from coconut cream, milk, oil, sugar, butter, whipping cream, ice cream, vinegar, virgin oil, coconut water, flour, chips and coconut milk drinks (to name a few) to their worldwide clients including supermarket chains and high-end supermarkets, food companies, hotels, and the cosmetic industry in Europe, North America, Japan, Australian, Germany, Netherland and other developed countries.
Minister Maru said: “Our Government, together with the Madang Provincial Government, are keen to work in partnership with Jaindi Exports and KIK to develop the proposed processing plant in Madang that would have the capacity to process up to 100,000 coconuts per day to produce high-end coconut products. This is a long overdue initiative, and I am so delighted that they are keen to start this project. I am so excited that after 50 years of independence, we will finally go into downstream processing of our coconuts to produce high-end products for the global market. The coconut industry is one of the industries in our country that has been around for a long time, but we have been semi-processing. We now want to process our coconuts into final products to maximize our value, create more jobs, and encourage the industry to grow if our people can see a better value.”
An independent financial evaluation of the investment proposal for a ten-year period will be conducted within two weeks after the visit to prove the viability of the project before a submission is made to the NEC for the approval of this project to be located within the Madang Integrated Special Economic Zone (SEZ).
Minister Maru further added that the biggest concern was not the market or the technology, but the price offered to the farmers.
“We must offer a good price to the farmers for the coconuts so they will be attracted to supply the nuts to the processing plant. This is critical.”
“The products manufactured in the proposed plant must also carry the ‘PNG Made’ logo so the world will know that these coconut products are from PNG,” he added.
Maru confirmed that equity will not be an issue.
Meanwhile, Minister Maru is working very closely with the Madang Provincial Government to secure 10 hectares of land in Madang for this very important investment that will transform the coconut industry in PNG.
Governor Pariwa is very keen and excited to see this project get off the ground as soon as practical.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
JAS UK Holdings acquire Pentagon Holdings,06/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6326,"The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) has given clearance to JAS UK Holdings Limited (JAS Holding) to proceed with its proposal to acquire Pentagon Holdings Limited (PHL) on September 08, 2025, after finding no substantial competition concerns in any markets in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
Both JAS Holdings and PHL are companies incorporated in the United Kingdom and operate in the freight forwarding and logistics services industry at the global level.
However, JAS does not operate in PNG, while PHL has operations here through its subsidiary, Pentagon Freight Services (PNG) Limited (Pentagon PNG).
As part of a global transaction, JAS Holding will acquire 100 percent of the issued share capital of PHL and its subsidiaries, including Pentagon PNG.
This means Pentagon PNG will become part of the JAS group of companies but will continue to operate in PNG.
ICCC's Acting Chief Executive Officer, Brian Ivosa, said after considering all available information, the ICCC concluded that since JAS does not currently operate in PNG, the proposed acquisition would not have, or would not be likely to have, the effect of substantially lessening competition in any domestic market.
""Post-Acquisition, Pentagon will continue to provide freight and logistics services in PNG, so customers will see no change or loss of choice in the market. The ICCC has therefore, given Clearance for the parties to proceed with the proposed acquisition,"" Mr Ivosa said.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Under the agreement, Central farmers will have a safe and consistent avenue to sell their produce, reducing reliance on traditional markets like where they face harassment and other challenges.
The agreement will also provide fair pricing, quality control, and technical support, with farmer incomes projected to increase by 20% to 45%.
Speaking at the signing, Taylor Pacific General Manager Jeremy Fry described the agreement as a significant investment in the future of local agriculture.
“We will see investment in training, in seeds and crops, and this sets the stage for the future we want to see for the farmers where we look to export and look to bigger markets outside of PNG. This is a fantastic CPG-led initiative, and we are happy to support it,” Mr Fry said.
He pointed to the success of the Western Highlands model, were bulk shipments of fresh produce supply markets nationwide.
“If we can apply that model to Central, that will make a lot of sense given the proximity. It also means affordability is going to be a lot better because we don’t have to pay for transport so this is really exciting,” he added.
Central Province Governor Rufina Peter said the partnership directly addresses one of the greatest challenges facing her people safe reliable market access.
“This agreement gives us the market access that most farmers lack. In the partnership, we will also be putting up buying depots which help with quality control. From our point of view as the Government responsible for the people of Central Province, we are investing to ensure market access becomes available both at the farm gate and in the Stop & Shop group of supermarkets. This partnership is very beneficial for us and for Stop & Shop as well,” Governor Peter said.
She added that with Papua New Guinea recently celebrating 50 years of Independence, the province must now strive for economic empowerment.
“Going forward, I hope this partnership with Stop & Shop and Taylor Pacific Limited will assist us in working towards economic independence and empowerment for the Central Province in the medium and long term.”
This agreement builds on earlier collaboration between Taylor Pacific Limited and the Central Provincial Government, including a memorandum of understanding for poultry development in Vanapa.
It also comes as Taylor Pacific continues to expand its agribusiness presence in PNG, having acquired Hugo Canning (producer of Ox & Palm Corned Beef), Sepik Fresh Poultry Farm, and planning a new poultry and beef facility in Vanapa.
Central Province is one of the first provincial governments in Papua New Guinea to sign such an agreement with Taylor Pacific positioning its farmers at the forefront of domestic and potential export markets.
For many growers who have long struggled with oversupply, high transport costs, and the absence of reliable buyers along with safe market access, this deal represents more than just an agreement, it marks a doorway to success.
To complement the initiative, the Central Provincial Government will also commission new markets at Bautama and Sabusa within the next three months.
These facilities will feature modern infrastructure and cold storage, further strengthening the province’s commitment to secure sustainable safe market access.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy

Queen Emma Boosts Cocoa Farmers through FAO-EU Partnership,02/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6273,"Queen Emma Chocolate, Papua New Guinea’s leading cocoa processor, is redefining the nation’s cocoa industry through a powerful partnership with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) under the EU-STREIT PNG Programme. Once held back by low capacity, smoke-tainted beans, and weak export ties, the company is now experiencing record growth, securing international markets while supporting Sepik farmers.
A USD 2.8 million investment support from FAO has modernised factory operations with 12 new machines, doubling output and meeting food-safety standards demanded by global buyers. This has allowed Queen Emma to consistently produce higher-grade chocolate and cocoa ingredients, with exports reaching PGK 5.6 million between January and August 2025.
On the ground, the partnership empowered cocoa producer groups such as Mupa, Juar, Ramangs, and Esse Mart. Together, they supplied 24 tonnes of quality beans valued at PGK 750,000 to Queen Emma this year, a lifeline for rural households. “The biggest impact has come from work done in the cocoa value chain… better dryers, knowledge, improved transport access,” said General Manager Karina Makori.
Beyond machinery, the programme lifted PNG’s international profile. Queen Emma showcased at trade events across Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, winning interest from boutique chocolatiers and ingredient buyers. The company’s “smoky beans” stigma is fading as farmers fetch higher prices for premium cocoa and gain steady incomes.
For Queen Emma, this transformation is more than business. “It has been a truly fulfilling and rewarding experience to see firsthand the impact that cocoa has on the lives of farmers,” Ms. Makori added.
With capacity expanding and reputation growing, Queen Emma is carrying Papua New Guinea’s cocoa to global premium markets while keeping pride and value at home.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
New factory to benefit coffee farmers,02/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6269,"Papua New Guinea’s coffee industry took a major leap forward on Thursday, 25th September 2025, with the official opening of the state-of-the-art Homestate Coffee Factory at Tanam, Morobe Province.

MRDC updates PNG LNG landowners on status of benefit payments,01/10/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6255,"In response to landowner concerns on social media about outstanding royalty and equity payments for certain landowner groups in the PNG LNG project, the Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC) has confirmed that royalty and equity benefits for Hides PDL1 landowners in Hela province have been withheld due to a court order stopping the Bank Account Opening process.
MRDC commenced the process in April 2024 but could not complete it due to ongoing disputes amongst clan leaders and a court order taken out by Landowners (Walape Mara OS (JR) No.198 of 2019), restraining MRDC from opening the clan bank accounts in PDL1.
MRDC stated that State Lawyers have gone to court to set aside this court order so the account opening process and the election of directors can be completed before the benefits are paid.
These processes (bank account opening and director election) are 80% complete but are being delayed by the court order.
MRDC is calling on clan leaders involved in the dispute to resolve their difference quickly in order to complete the process for PDL1 and have the benefits released.
For Hides PDL7 in Hela, royalty benefits for 2014 – 2021, and equity benefits for 2014 – 2017 have been paid. MRDC states that royalties from 2022 – current and equities from 2018 – current will be paid once the Central Bank of PNG releases the payments to them. This also includes the Pipeline and Plant Site landowners.
MRDC is currently working with National Petroleum Authority and the  Department of Finance for the Central Bank to release the royalty benefits for this group of landowners.
PNG LNG project royalty and equity benefits for PDL 2 (Kutubu), and PDL 3 & 4 (Gobe) have also been withheld pending the resolution of a number of disputes.","Business, Frustration",Business,Frustration
PNG losing K1.5b annually in alluvial mining,29/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6228,"Papua New Guinea loses K1.5 billion annually in revenue from the alluvial mining sector.
Mineral Resources Authority’s executive manager, Stanley Nekitel, revealed this today during the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery hearing in Port Moresby.
The hearing by the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery highlights the need for urgent reforms to enhance revenue collection and improve the management of natural resources.
The Committee, upon hearing of a substantial amount of money the country is missing in the alluvial mining sector, raises concerns highlighting issues such as regulatory inefficiencies, inadequate oversight, and a lack of formalization within the sector.
“In 2023, saw the lowest production of gold. It generated 40,000 ounces of gold, bringing K120 million. A significant drop. In 2020, it produced 120 ounces of gold, K650 million in revenue,” Nekitel told the Committee
“Why do we have these huge drops in the revenue coming into the country while we have increased production of gold? Juffa asked.
“Something is wrong somewhere,” he said.
Mr Nekitel clarified that lots of factors and challenges are involved, which lead to the decrease in revenue coming into the country.
Alluvial mining, which often involves small-scale operations, plays a crucial role in many local economies, but it can also result in environmental degradation and missed opportunities for the government to benefit from this sector.
The loss of such a substantial amount of revenue could have widespread implications for public services and infrastructure development in PNG.
Addressing these issues could involve implementing stricter regulatory frameworks, encouraging the formal registration of alluvial miners, and improving tax collection mechanisms.
Additionally, fostering a partnership between the government and local communities involved in alluvial mining could promote sustainable practices and ensure that a fair share of revenues is directed back into local development.
Efforts to reform the sector may also need to focus on providing training and resources to miners to transition toward more sustainable practices, ensuring that economic benefits are maximized while reducing negative environmental impacts.","Business, Sadness",Business,Sadness
Homestate ventures into coffee exports,29/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6219,"Homestate, a nationally-owned company known for distributing long-grained Jasmine rice, is now venturing into coffee.
The Homestate Coffee Factory, located at Tanam, near Nadzab, was officially opened on Thursday, September 25th, by Homestate chairman, Paiboon Wetwattana, and Minister for Coffee, William Bando.
Homestate director and chairman of Kumul Consolidated Holdings, Moses Maladina, said the state-of-the-art facility, valued at over K100 million, will process, cup and export coffee to the world.
“And this is only the beginning,” Maladina said.
“We are growing our own coffee and we’ll work hand-in-hand with both smallholder and large block holder farmers.”
The factory will also serve as a training hub for both coffee and rice farming.
“This year, Homestate celebrates 25 years since its establishment. Over that time, we have become a trusted name in the rice business. And today, we begin a new chapter.
“We are proud to step into coffee; an industry whose full potential in PNG has yet to be realised.”
Maladina drew attention to the chairman and Homestate founder, Paiboon Wetwattana, who is commonly referred to as “Tony”.
“An electrical engineer by profession, a former lecturer and professor at the prestigious King Mongkut’s University of Technology in Bangkok and most importantly, a proud citizen of Papua New Guinea.
“Together with his family, Tony has made PNG his home. His vision and confidence in this country is what made this investment possible.”
With Homestate already receiving its licence to export coffee, Minister Bando issued the challenge that the licence to operate comes with a strategic national responsibility. The Coffee Industry Corporation has set a target of 150,000 bags for exporters – 5 percent of our national goal.
“This is your mandate,” stated Minister Bando.
“But hear me clearly: this growth must be inclusive and equitable. Your success will be measured not just by your export volume, but by the prosperity of the 300 family units you will connect to, the fair prices you pay at the factory door, and the shared value you create.
“The era of talk is over. The era of action is here.
“This mill is a testament to that action. It represents a future where Morobe’s coffee is processed in Morobe, by Morobeans, for the benefit of Morobe and Papua New Guinea.”","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
New cocoa initiative,29/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6216,"International demand for quality Papua New Guinean cocoa and chocolate has been made stronger, through a unique Australian Government-supported partnership to help PNG farmers, processors and exporters derive greater benefit from the trade.
The (approx.) PGK 1.2 million initiative will boost quality cocoa production in Central Province and strengthen the supply for local producers, like Paradise Food’s Queen Emma Chocolate (QEC), so that they can better meet demand in the lucrative Australian and New Zealand markets.
The project is being driven by QEC in cooperation with 3 Central Province enterprises: Frontier Primary Produce Ltd operating out of Kuriva, Cocoalands Development Ltd near Moreguina and Amazon Cocoa
Cooperative in Abau.
Under the project, three dedicated extension officers will assist Central smallholder farmers, training them in advanced cocoa block management techniques, husbandry practices and processing.
Their work will be supported by the establishment of nurseries to raise around 62,500 high quality PNG Cocoa Board-certified seedlings for distribution by the three enterprises.
The initiative will help QEC address the chronic challenges it has faced in reliably accessing quality cocoa, helping it cultivate a more localised and cost-effective supply of quality cocoa - cutting costs and boosting earnings for cocoa farmers, their families, and communities.
In helping strengthen the supply of quality cocoa, the project will also empower women working in the industry.
Giau Duruba, Director for Amazon Cocoa Cooperative, said that to deliver their cocoa to buyers in Port Moresby, smallholder farmers from the remote Cloudy Bay area must first travel for seven hours by dinghy to Moreguina Station. From there they cover an additional 150 to 170 kilometres by road into Port Moresby to meet buyers. The partnership ensures a guaranteed buyer is on standby to take their cocoa.
The project will not only boost the financial security of cocoa farming families but, by improving farming practices that reduce soil degradation and resource wastage, it will support joint PNG and Australia efforts to minimise the impact of climate change and help vulnerable communities adapt.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
BSP Commits 100K to Tuna Forum,25/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6182,"Bank South Pacific (BSP) has committed K100,000 as a Platinum Sponsor of the 9th Pacific Tuna Forum (PTF). This reinforces its role in supporting sustainable development and economic empowerment across the Pacific.
BSP Acting General Manager Corporate, David Bishop, announced the sponsorship, saying, “BSP is proud to partner with the National Fisheries Authority as a Platinum Sponsor of the 9th Pacific Tuna Forum. Our sponsorship is a demonstration of our commitment to the region’s development and to ensuring the sustainability of the tuna industry, which is vital for food security and economic growth.”
The 9th Pacific Tuna Forum will be held from October 14–15, 2025, at the Sofitel Hotel, Denarau Island, Nadi, Fiji, under the theme: “Pacific Tuna 2050: Resilience, Innovation, Equity, and Sustainable Trade for a Prosperous Future.”
National Fisheries Authority (NFA) Managing Director Justin Ilakini acknowledged BSP’s support, saying, “The Pacific Tuna Forum is an initiative of the Government of Papua New Guinea through the NFA. The fact that the NFA has been consistently holding this biannual event is also a testament to the support of the government, industry and business community including BSP.”
Since its inception in 2007, the Pacific Tuna Forum has become the region’s premier tuna industry event, co-hosted by Pacific countries including Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Palau, and Solomon Islands. Past forums have been held in Port Moresby, Honiara, Koror, and Nadi, attracting more than 200 participants, including policymakers, industry stakeholders, and NGOs.
Recognized by regional bodies such as the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA), and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the PTF provides a sole regional platform to address issues including climate change, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, trade opportunities, and innovation in tuna processing.
Ilakini stressed the Pacific’s global significance, with the Western and Central Pacific Ocean accounting for nearly 60 per cent of the world’s tuna catch.
“Through forums like the PTF, Pacific nations can maximize value retention, drive industry growth, promote equitable wealth distribution, and strengthen resilience in the face of climate change,” he said.
The 9th forum will be jointly organized by PNG’s NFA and Fiji’s Ministry of Fisheries, under a memorandum of understanding signed by Fisheries Ministers from both countries. PNG will cover conference costs while Fiji oversees hosting functions and logistics, in consultation with INFOFISH, the intergovernmental body specializing in fisheries trade and market development.
BSP’s sponsorship is expected to help deliver a successful conference that brings together governments, industry leaders, and communities to shape the future of tuna fisheries.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
"Grow poultry industry, says Maru",25/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6179,"The Republic of Korea’s second-largest chicken company, Charmfre Inc., is looking at investing in the poultry industry in Papua New Guinea, after signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the government, which paves the way for that.
On Wednesday, September 24, the Ministry of International Trade and Investment signed the MoU with Chamfre Inc., Wonkwang University of the Republic of Korea, in Port Moresby.
The MoU aimed to cooperate in vocational training, industrial talent development, trade, investment, and research, as well as developing import and export, to contribute to economic development and strengthen industrial cooperation between PNG and Korea.
The Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, said since the cost of chicken in Port Moresby was high, it is likely that Central Province could host a poultry industry.
“PNG is a net importer of chicken. We are currently importing over K200 million worth of chicken annually, which means we are not producing enough chicken to meet our own domestic demand. Port Moresby does not have a major poultry operation. Our city is supplied from Lae, and that is why the cost of chicken is very high due to the freight cost,” said Minister Maru.
He said global players like Charmfre is vital to partner with the National Government, the Central Provincial Government, and Papua New Guinean companies to invest in a major poultry operation within the Central Province.
“Our need is not only broiler meat, but also eggs and day-old chicks. We are looking at a major investor who can operate in the entire value chain of a chicken, including exports. We have already indicated to them (Charmfre) that a poultry project in Central Province will be considered a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) where we will offer incentives.”
Maru said that with a vast growing population and with more projects and SEZs, there will be more demand for chicken in the country, so investing in the poultry space is needed.
“The Marape-Rosso Government is keen to replace all chicken imports and be a net exporter of chicken. Partnerships with countries like Korea and its leading poultry companies, which own a global export brand like Charmfre, would be an exciting investment prospect,” added Minister Maru.
Chairman of the PNG Poultry Industry Association, Chis Prestwood, further supported by saying: “We have had difficulties in chicken supplies this year, with the number one reason being the countries that we have been importing chicken from being hit by avian influenza. “It is critically important that our industry builds capacity by having our government open doors for other countries to come and partner with us to create that capacity.”
He added that the country must stop importing and create opportunities. “Over the next 10 years, the poultry industry needs to invest more than K1.2 billion to ensure we meet these milestones. We have the potential. Meanwhile, our existing producers are doing a wonderful job. This year, production in PNG has grown by 40 percent, which is tremendous.”","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Speaking during the opening of this vital road link, CEO and Managing Director of OTML, Kedi Ilimbit said Ok Tedi as a 100 per cent nationally owned company is continuing to improve the lives of Papua New Guineans through its Infrastructure Tax Credit (ITCS) Scheme and said these projects will now enable people to have easy and fast access to basic goods and services that have been lacking.
Telefomin will be further linked to other parts of the country with more upcoming planned road developments in the area, including the Telefomin to Hela Road and Telefomin to Vanimo roads.
Prime MinisterJames Marape officially attended the opening and also launched the Telefomin – Oksapmin – Kopiago road construction with a groundbreaking ceremony and unveiled the Telefomin town masterplan.
Mr Ilimbit said this road is expected to transform the lives of the locals, providing them with better access to cheaper goods and services that foster social and economic growth.
“I used to walk days to attend school here at the Telefomin Secondary School years ago, today kids from our nearby Min communities can travel to school easily by road, the people will have access to markets, there will be further basic services improvements including education and health and generally an improved standard of living for the Min people,” Mr Ilimbit said.
“And that is a dream come true for all the locals here and a very momentous occasion in our history,” he said.
Mr Ilimbit acknowledged everyone who contributed to the delivery of this infrastructure especially the contractors who led the construction of this road and commended the government for its support towards TCS funded projects in the country.
“Although Ok Tedi is commended for being the major player in this infrastructure development, without government support, Ok Tedi wouldn’t have been able to deliver the project anyway, so on behalf of the local Min people - thankyou to the current Member for Telefomin and Works Minister Honorable Solan Mirism and the Honorable Prime Minister James Marape and the PNG Government for  this milestone infrastructure delivery.
Since 1997 Ok Tedi has contributed PGK948.7 million towards development in Western province and Telefomin (West Sepik) in various sectors such as health, education, law and justice, and transport.","Development, Joy",Development,Joy
Lae chamber sounds warning on scammers,19/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6103,"The business community in Lae has been advised to be wary of individuals seeking contributions for the haus krai and funeral expenses for the late Morobe Governor, Luther Wenge.
Lae Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) president, John Byrne, sounded the alarm after his office received an email on September 17 at 10.10pm, from an email address with the Lae MP, John Rosso’s name.
The email directed Byrne to get his team to “facilitate a K50,000 tomorrow to take care of necessary funeral arrangements for our late governor haus krai”.
The email went on to provide a BSP account number, saying: “Please get this request done first thing”.
“He/She is using a *fake* email address pretending to be Honorable DPM, John Rosso,” stated Byrne.
“DPM wishes to make it perfectly clear that he would never solicit funds for such events in this manner.
“Unless you are contacted directly and verbally by his personal assistant or himself, any request of this style (is) fake.

Districts to be allocated market space,18/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6093,"Vendors from the 10 districts of Morobe Province will have their own allocated spaces in the upgraded Lae Main Market.
Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, made this known at the groundbreaking of the approximately K155 million main market redevelopment project.
The groundbreaking event, hosted on Wednesday, September 17, was officiated by Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso, Australian High Commissioner, Ewen McDonald and his New Zealand counterpart, Peter Zwart.
Before the program started, a minute of silence was observed in honour of Morobe’s late Governor, Songang Luther Wenge, who had passed away on Saturday, September 13th, after an illness.
Rosso, who officially opened and declared the commencement of the construction of new Lae Main Market, said the long wait is over, and work will commence immediately and run for approximately 12 months.
“This market will benefit all of us,” said Rosso. “But there will be special places in this market where mothers from Nawaeb will have their own corner to sell their produce. Those from Huon will have their own space, my people from Markham will also have their allocated space as well as those from Menyamya, Bulolo and Wau-Waria.
“You will not have to fight for space.
“The same goes for my people of Lae as well. You will have your own corner. Even our mothers from the highlands will have their own allocated space.
“This market belongs to all of Papua New Guinea, but you will have your own allocated spaces.”
After extending Australia’s sympathies to the family of the late Governor Wenge, to Morobe and the country, Australia’s High Commissioner to PNG, Ewen McDonald, outlined that this redevelopment is an important undertaking because Lae is the commercial capital of the country.
“It’s also the gateway to the highlands and the islands; a place where so much of Papua New Guinea’s food and agriculture exports are grown, where industry thrives,” he stated.
“It is the hub that links farmers, traders and businesses with the rest of the country and the region.”
The upgraded double-storey market is funded by the Australian and New Zealand governments, and the Lae City Authority. The breakup of costs is: AUD45 million, or K125 million, from the Australian government, over K25 million from the NZ government and K5 million from LCA.
The upgraded market is projected to cater to 1,300 vendors and will have 20 kiosks for small and medium enterprises in an environment that is said to be “modern, sustainable and inclusive”.
The market’s design will reflect the local environment and the culture of Ahi landowners.
Meantime, Commissioner McDonald paid a special tribute to the late Joanne Ganoka, their senior project coordinator, who passed away a few months ago.
“Many of you will know that Joanne was a conduit between the vendors and the project stakeholders,” he said. “She ensured that vendors had a voice.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

BSP launch “50for50” initiative,13/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6036,"BSP Financial Group Limited is celebrating the nation’s golden milestone by giving back to the people who have been central to its journey.
In celebration of PNG’s 50th Independence, BSP launched its “50for50 – Givim Bek” initiative today, Friday, September 12, during its annual PNG Flag raising – an event staff proudly participated in across all 80-plus branches throughout the country.
The “50for50 – Givim Bek” initiative will see BSP invest K2.5 million into 50 community-driven projects nationwide — empowering 50 communities with grants of K50,000 each.
BSP Board Chairman, Robert Bradshaw said the initiative is more than a gift; it is a reflection of BSP’s role as a partner in nation-building.
“BSP is not only part of the country’s history but also its future. At Independence in 1975, we were a small domestic bank. Today, we are the South Pacific’s largest financial group. Our ‘50for50 – Givim Bek’ Program reaffirms our deep connection with the communities we serve and ensures that progress is shared across PNG – at least one community in each province will receive this support over the next year,” Bradshaw said.
He said the initiative complements BSP’s longstanding Community Projects Program, which already delivers more than K1.2 million annually through branch and business unit projects in health, education, and community development. Together, these commitments will leave a lasting legacy of education, youth empowerment, sustainable livelihoods, and better health outcomes.
He highlighted that BSP’s impact extends well beyond banking services.
“It’s important to remember that 83 per cent of our shareholders are everyday Papua New Guineans, through their superannuation funds, landowner holding companies, and local investments. When BSP succeeds, it is the people of PNG who benefit, as wealth and opportunity flow back into households, communities, and the wider economy,” he concluded.
As PNG looks forward to its next 50 years, BSP’s role as a partner in nation-building remains as vital as ever. He emphasized that their purpose is clear and that is to empower people, grow communities, and create prosperity that endures across generations.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy

BPNG stresses importance of microfinance,11/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/6017,"The Central Bank (BPNG) has reaffirmed its commitment to building an inclusive financial system, stressing that microfinance is vital to national development.
Deputy Governor of BPNG, Jeffery Yabom during his keynote address to the PNG Microfinance  Diagnostic Validation Workshop held on Wednesday, September 3, 2025, noted that more than 80 percent of Papua New Guineans live in rural and remote communities with limited access to financial services.
He described microfinance as a “lifeline,” enabling families to save, invest, educate their children, and grow small businesses.
Reflecting on progress since Papua New Guinea signed the Maya Declaration on Financial Inclusion in 2013, the Deputy Governor said: “At that time, fewer than one in five Papua New Guineans had access to formal financial services. Today, under the National Financial Inclusion Strategy 2023–2027, there are more than 4.3 million bank accounts, a result of the combined efforts of BPNG, financial institutions, and development partners.”
While acknowledging this progress, Mr. Yabom cautioned that challenges remain, including the high costs of serving rural areas, weak governance in microfinance institutions, and limited product diversity.
He called for expansion into new services such as micro-insurance, remittances, and SME products, while strengthening consumer protection and regulatory oversight.
He further emphasized the opportunities that exist in digital finance, women’s economic empowerment, strategic partnerships, and climate-resilient “green finance.”
He noted that financial inclusion is central to PNG’s Vision 2050 and its medium-term development plans.
“BPNG will continue working closely with government, the private sector, and development partners to ensure that microfinance remains sustainable, innovative, and inclusive,” Mr. Yabom assured.
ADB consultant Mr. Jagdeep Dahiya also delivered two key presentations at the workshop. In his first presentation, Status of Microfinance – Key Findings, Mr. Dahiya outlined how PNG’s financial sector has expanded since the Microfinance Expansion Project, which established CEFI.
He reported that PNG now has over 4.3 million deposit accounts, compared to the initial target of one million in 2013.
However, microfinance institutions still account for less than three percent of total financial sector assets, with services skewed toward urban areas. He also highlighted the dominance of commercial banks in deposit mobilization, while noting that Microbanks and Savings and Loan societies have broader outreach in rural areas.
Despite growth in account ownership, access to credit remains low, leaving many Papua New Guineans dependent on informal lending.
He further observed that the gender gap in financial access has widened, calling for renewed efforts to advance women’s financial inclusion.
In his second presentation - Challenges and Key Recommendations - Mr. Dahiya identified major barriers, including limited regulatory incentives, low digital financial literacy, weak consumer protection, and inadequate ID systems.
He also pointed to high banking fees, lack of trust in formal institutions, and poor infrastructure as obstacles to participation.
To address these issues, Mr. Dahiya recommended strengthening policy frameworks, fostering innovation in digital finance, expanding funding to microfinance institutions, and simplifying compliance processes to improve access.
He concluded that coordinated efforts across government, industry, and development partners are essential to strengthening microfinance and ensuring inclusive growth in Papua New Guinea.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

PNGSDP and Digicel have had an enduring partnership for the last 14 years. This partnership has seen Digicel maintaining and upgrading both the network and towers in Western Province.
Today, PNGSDP renewed this partnership by announcing an extension of the Managed Services Agreement with Digicel for another three years, in line with its Enabling Services Pillar.
“Today is an exciting day for us and we’re really happy and excited to extend our agreement and our partnership with Digicel. It is a partnership that we’ve had for 16 years, I think. It is to extend access to mobile coverage, telecommunication in general right across Western Province and into remote communities.""
“So for us at SDP, telecommunication and this particular partnership is important to us because of the fact that it is an enabling service and it helps to support other essential development pillars such as health, education and livelihoods and those are pillars and programs that SDP are heavily invested in right across Western Province,” Taviri said.
She also announced SDP’s plans to expand digital programs in the province.
“And I think the next phase for us is to look at how we can develop the market, in particular with more access to affordable mobile phones, looking at innovative content and looking at just increasing digital literacy in general right across Western Province. And I think that’s the next step for us and it’ll be something that we will focus on in the next three years as we extend this relationship with Digicel,” Taviri added.
Representing Digicel, CEO, Tarik Boudiaf welcomed the extension of this partnership, strengthening the long-established relationship between these two organizations.
He highlighted Digicel’s commitment to empower communities, looking beyond commercial agreements.
“We have been working for many years in very remote areas and we know how its difficult to reach out to these regions from logistics and geographical point of view.
“For us we don’t see it as just a commercial agreement but it is more and is part of our vision and value that we share together,” said Tarik.
Under the renewed agreement, Digicel and SDP will introduce Supercell technology to optimize coverage across 19 blackspot areas and make redundant six out of SDP’s 70 mobile towers.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy

Crucial role of career fairs,02/09/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5887,"Career fairs bridge the gap between education and employment.
Deputy Vice Chancellor from the PNG University of Technology in Lae, Professor Garry Sali, emphasised how a career fair serves as an essential bridge between students and industry partners.
Professor Sali made this statement when expressing his delight at the successful hosting of the university’s career fair from Friday August 29, to Saturday August 30, where 22 exhibitors participated.
“It’s an annual event, especially in August,” said Professor Sali. “Since I came in 2007 so it has been ongoing.
“We see how important this career fair is because of the opportunity for students to know the industries, and industries also need to know the different programs that the university offers.
“The programs that we have at the university must be relevant to the industry needs out there. So, our programs are designed in such a way that they meet the industry demands.
“The industries want the best but they must also understand the different range of students; the top students, the average students and the bottom students. But they have completed the program, they have got the knowledge, the skills and talents and I believe they must be given the opportunity to prove themselves in the industries.”
Professor Sali outlined that while some students perform well academically, they may not be as skilled as their counterparts who do not do well in theory.
He stressed that equal opportunity needs to be given to students who graduate from the institution, hence, the career fair will continue to be a valuable tool for both job seekers and employers, and will continue to be an annual event at PNGUoT.
Ok Tedi Mining Ltd was this year’s platinum sponsor, with the Tabubil mine operator indicating that it intends to continue with the sponsorship next year.

Unity and good business management,21/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5740,"The acquisition of three Dash 8 aircrafts, worth approximately 30 million kina, represents the realisation of a long-held dream, especially as the fleet will be operated through Pacific Direct under lease to Ok Tedi Mining Limited.
They are fully owned by the Ok Tedi Landowners Royalty Investment Trust and the Milum Group of Companies. Chairman of the Trust, Henry Asekim, emphasized that the future for Star Mountain landowners lies in business.
“Our mine — yes, that is our mine. Our pride — yes, that is our pride. But the future? The future is business. That is the path we must take,” he declared, announcing also the addition of two 300 series aircrafts - one for international flights and the other for domestic routes.
Councilor Brian Yapi, representing the beneficiaries, said the milestone reflects the vision of past leaders and the commitment of current management.
“When I look at the Royalty Trust today, I see big changes. It is now being managed by our own sons of the land, and we can witness the results through achievements like this aircraft,” he said, urging the mine villages to put aside differences and support local businesses like MRSM and the Royalty Trust.
Beyond dividends — with five million kina to be distributed this year — the investment also promises broader opportunities, including new international and domestic routes. The message from leaders was clear: unity and good business management are key to securing a sustainable future for the 12 mine villages long after the mine closes.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
BSP Staff Mark Service Milestone,21/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5737,"BSP Financial Group Limited has honoured 42 long-serving employees whose combined service surpasses 1,000 years, reflecting the bank’s enduring commitment to people and communities across Papua New Guinea and the Pacific.
The recognition, held in Port Moresby on Tuesday, 19th August 2025, saw 36 employees awarded for 25 years of service and six for an extraordinary 40 years, totaling 1,165 years of collective dedication.
BSP Group CEO Mark Robinson described the milestone as a testament to the organisation’s strength.
“Everyone being celebrated plays a special role in the history of BSP,” Robinson said. “Some of you 25-year awardees have lived through defining chapters such as the BSP-PNGBC merger in 2002, the Colonial Bank acquisition in Fiji in 2009, and the Westpac acquisition across five Pacific countries in 2015 and 2016. Regardless of when you joined, what has always remained constant is your dedication to the communities where we operate.”

Ilimbit lauds Milum Aviation,21/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5736,"Milum Aviation was officially launched this week. The launch comes after years of limited flight access for the residents of Tabubil, who frequently struggled to find seats on commercial flights.
Managing Director and CEO of Ok Tedi Mining Limited (OTML) Kedi Ilimbit said, “Owning aircraft of this scale is a major achievement, and I want to acknowledge those who made it happen.”
Ilimbit noted that with Milum Aviation operating alongside Ok Tedi’s charters, travel to Port Moresby and other destinations will now be more accessible.
The creation of Milum Aviation was a collaborative effort between the 12 mine villages, represented by their trustees — Chairman Henry Asekim, Deputy Chairman Maino Lucas, and trustee Joel Duggan. Ilimbit explained that the trustees convinced the Milum Board, which includes independent members and government representatives, that investing in aviation was the right step forward.
“I had to play my part by reassuring the board that this vision would work. Aubrey DeSouza, as CEO, did well to present the model and win their support. It required faith, persistence, and the courage to say yes,” Ilimbit said.
The new airline is part of a broader strategy by Milum, which already operates in road transport, logistics, and maintenance. Ilimbit emphasized that stewardship of the business is critical to ensure its success and long-term benefits for the community.
“This airline belongs to the people. Balus blo mipla, mipla baim, mipla lukautim — these are our planes, we bought them, and we will look after them. They will make money for our people,” he said.
OTML supported the initiative by changing the trust deed to allow investments in commercial ventures such as aviation. Milum Aviation aims to serve as a model for other mining regions in PNG, demonstrating how local communities can benefit through wealth creation and ownership rather than merely nominal involvement.
“The mine has a long life ahead. Some people say 2050, but I believe it will go beyond our generation. This gives us time to build strong local businesses — in aviation, logistics, and other sectors — so our children and grandchildren inherit opportunities,” Ilimbit said.
He concluded by urging the Milum board to continue expanding the airline to compete with other carriers in the country. “Tonight, we celebrate the birth of Milum Air — with its blue, green, and white stripes — a child of the mine villages that will fly for generations to come,” Ilimbit said.
Milum Aviation now provides a new avenue for regional connectivity, business opportunities, and ownership for the twelve mine villages, setting a precedent for community-driven ventures in Papua New Guinea.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
Landowner Airline Marks New Era of Growth,21/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5729,"The recent acquisition of three Dash 8 aircraft by the Milum Group of Companies and the Ok Tedi Landowners Royalty Trust has been hailed as a business milestone and a generational turning point for landowners of the 12 mine villages.
Speaking during the official announcement, Aubrey DeSouza, CEO of Milum Group and the Ok Tedi Trust, highlighted the long journey that led to this moment. He recalled the Trust’s first step into aviation in 2004 with the purchase of a Twin Otter, leased to Airlines PNG. While that venture was eventually sold, the Trust redirected its investments into hotels, commercial buildings, stocks, and shares, building a strong asset base of over K200 million in market value today.
“The idea is to collect royalties from Ok Tedi and invest them for the future of the beneficiaries until mine closure or the end of the trustee. Our main purpose is investment in quality assets,” Mr. DeSouza said, emphasising that the aircraft purchase is a business decision designed to generate long-term profits for landowners.
He also acknowledged the contributions of the late Joe Kanal, a key figure in past capital investments, and paid tribute to the strong governance and teamwork within the Trust that has enabled this achievement.
For Pacific Direct, the aviation partner managing and maintaining the fleet, the milestone represents the culmination of a decades-long dream. CEO Darren Moncrieff described the development as a result of vision, persistence, and unity among landowners and their partners.
“Today represents a dream that has taken more than thirty years to become reality. The key message here is to never give up dreaming, never stop working towards those dreams,” Mr. Moncrieff said.
He further announced the launch of cadet pilot and cadet cabin crew training programs, set to begin in 2026, aimed at preparing the next generation of landowners to take part directly in aviation operations. Recruitment will begin in late 2025.
In addition to the aviation programs, Mr. Moncrieff revealed Pacific Direct’s support for local education, including plans to help renovate the Finalbin School.
Both leaders stressed that this is just the beginning of greater opportunities. With additional aircraft planned and new aviation routes to be opened, the partnership between landowners, Milum Group, and Pacific Direct is set to deliver financial returns, skills transfer, and long-term development benefits across the 12 mine villages and beyond.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
PNG Cocoa Industry Goes Digital,20/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5710,"On August 19, Papua New Guinea’s cocoa industry entered a new digital era with the launch of the Cocoa Management Information System (CMIS), a digital platform designed to streamline data collection, improve planning, and boost productivity across the cocoa value chain.
Developed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) under the EU-STREIT PNG Programme, and co-designed with the Cocoa Board of PNG (CBPNG) and the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), the CMIS was officially handed over to the Cocoa Board in Kokopo.
The system consolidates real-time data on farmer profiles, seedling distribution, training, production yields, nursery status, and export volumes. It enables faster reporting, reduces errors, and strengthens coordination between farmers, agribusinesses, and government agencies.
“CMIS automates data collection, strengthens planning, and ensures support reaches farmers faster,” said Kanagat Alyshbaev, Project Officer for ITU-STREIT.
Fifteen Cocoa Board officers in East Sepik have already been trained in Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI), using tablets and smartphones to collect and validate field data instantly.
This digital pipeline ensures timely, accurate information flows into the CMIS for analysis and decision-making.
“This system will help us monitor exports, generate reports, and support the industry better,” said Jesse Anjen, CEO of the Cocoa Board.
The CMIS is part of the EU-STREIT PNG Programme’s broader mission to drive rural transformation through digital innovation. It aligns with the EU’s Global Gateway Strategy, which promotes sustainable development by expanding digital capabilities in agriculture and trade.
“We’re proud to see ICT innovation powering agriculture and livelihoods in PNG,” said Russell Woruba, DICT Deputy Secretary.
As the system rolls out nationwide, it is expected to improve traceability, raise incomes, and connect PNG’s cocoa producers more effectively with global markets.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Engagement of Lae youths in casual jobs helping to drive positive change,15/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5663,"Involving youths in the development of their own communities is one way of encouraging them to take ownership of their city.
Unemployed youths in Lae city have expressed delight at being engaged in construction work by the Lae City Authority.
Tangible changes can be seen under the youth development program, which is funded by the World Bank, and managed by LCA.
Those in Lae may have noticed young men and women, in bright-coloured vests and safety boots, building footpaths around the city or within the Botanical Gardens, or helping with the construction of drains and roads.
At Tent City, on the fringes of Lae, teams of  casual workers are building drains in preparation for the actual road building that will happen later.
Young men from the community have been hired as casual labourers.
With funding coming from the Lae City Authority, this is the first time in 30 years that the roads there are being fixed.
Young men and women are recruited through a program that offers two paths – training for employment and training to start businesses. So far, more than 2,000 youths have registered and participated.
“In the community that I live in, most of our youth in Ward Two, within Seventh St, are being engaged in this project,” shared Godleaf Wengi, the screening supervisor.
“Many of them tend to help their parents, most of whom are unemployed. So, when we involve the youth that come from broken homes, we note changes in the community, especially with petty crimes.
“They used to snatch passersby’s bags and bilums but that has decreased.
“This program is beneficial as it helps our youth.”
Youth facilitator, Roy Dingu, said: “We have trainers who train them to be work ready, train them on punctuality, safety awareness and anything regarding employment for that 10 days. “After that BLST (basic lifeskills training), they go for Urban Works and Services, another 30 days of practical work, where we can see them working around the city.
“After the 30 days, they come to another stage called ‘internship’.”
Participants must attain 80 percent attendance at UWS to qualify and proceed to either 65 days of internship or 65 days of TVET.
Several businesses houses in Lae, like Chemcare Group, are also supporting LCA’s initiatives. The Lae private sector has recruited dozens of youth through the internship program.
“I am very thankful,” said youth trainee, Aloysius Miria. “This opportunity is rare. I see this as a blessing.”","Development, Joy",Development,Joy

BSP Recognised for advancing inclusion,05/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5520,"BSP Financial Group Ltd has been honoured with the 2025 Service Member Recognition Award by the PNG Chamber of Resources & Energy (PNGCORE) for its outstanding contribution to inclusive financial services and sustainable development in Papua New Guinea.
Presented at the closing of the PNGCORE Resource Week in Port Moresby, the award acknowledges BSP’s enduring commitment to serving Papua New Guineans across all regions, particularly in remote and resource-based communities. With a strong presence across seven Pacific markets, BSP continues to expand access to financial services in both traditional and digital forms.
“BSP has served Papua New Guinea for over 68 years, growing to become one of the region’s most trusted financial institutions,” said Penelope Aisi, Program Manager with BSP’s Retail Customer Value Management Team. “This recognition by PNGCORE reinforces our commitment to partnership, economic development, and community empowerment.”
Among its many innovations, BSP’s Wantok Wallet—launched in February 2025—was cited as a key example of inclusive banking. The mobile platform allows users to make secure, cardless transactions without requiring internet access, a smartphone, or even a bank account.
However, beyond product innovation, BSP’s broader mission to champion progress and prosperity was a defining factor in PNGCORE’s decision to confer the award. The bank's efforts span decades of investment in people, technology, and rural outreach, ensuring that financial inclusion is more than a slogan—it’s a working reality for thousands across PNG.
“We thank PNGCORE for this meaningful recognition and look forward to continuing our work alongside all sectors to build a stronger, more inclusive future for our people,” Aisi added.
This marks a significant milestone for BSP as it continues to align its financial services with national development goals and support the long-term wellbeing of all Papua New Guineans.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

PNG Unveils Major Energy Reforms,02/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5494,"Papua New Guinea is set to transform its energy landscape with the announcement of a landmark legislation aimed at regulating the entire refined petroleum supply chain. The news was delivered by the Minister for Energy during his keynote address at the PNG Resources Summit in Port Moresby.
Speaking before an audience of government officials, industry leaders, and energy stakeholders, the minister presented the National Energy Authority (Refined Petroleum Products Supply) Bill 2025, a proposed law that will provide a unified legislative framework covering the importation, storage, transportation, distribution, wholesale, and retail of refined petroleum products.
The move comes in response to recent disruptions, including the 2023 fuel and foreign exchange shortages, which highlighted vulnerabilities in PNG’s energy systems. The minister said the reforms are necessary to ensure long-term energy security and economic resilience.
“We are at a pivotal moment, where the decisions we make and the actions we take will fundamentally shape the energy landscape for generations to come,” he stated.
Key objectives of the Bill include stabilizing fuel supply, improving regulatory compliance, enhancing environmental and public health protections, and creating a competitive market for downstream petroleum operations.
The reforms fall under the broader National Energy Authority Policy 2017–2027, which guides the Marape-led government’s approach to building a sustainable and resilient energy sector.
“The broader ambition of the Bill is to create a well-regulated, competitive, and sustainable domestic supply chain for downstream refined petroleum products in PNG,” the minister emphasized.
The proposed law also underscores the importance of safeguarding environmental standards and public safety in an industry known for its potential hazards.
Once passed, the legislation will empower the National Energy Authority (NEA) to close regulatory gaps, improve consumer protection, and strengthen governance across the petroleum sector.
The Minister for Energy concluded by calling on all stakeholders to support the reform process, describing it as a critical step toward a stable and sustainable energy future for Papua New Guinea.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
A New Dawn for Housing and Development,01/08/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5484,"The last three years have seen significant reforms made within the Lands Department, which have paved the way for Papua New Guineans to be able to buy and own homes.
At the heart of this transformation are the Land Partnership Program and a revitalized focus on affordable housing, initiatives championed by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Lands and Physical Planning, John Rosso.
These programs are not just about building houses; they are about fundamentally changing how land is accessed, managed, and developed across the nation.
For decades, the complexities of land ownership and administration have presented significant hurdles to development in PNG. With approximately 97 percent of land held under customary tenure, mobilising land for large-scale projects, including housing, has been a persistent challenge.
However, the Marape-led government is determined to change this narrative.
The Land Partnership Program, approved through National Executive Council (NEC) Decision No. 226/2023, is a strategic move to bridge the gap between traditional land ownership and modern development needs.
“The Land Partnership Program is a new Government of Papua New Guinea initiative aimed at accessing land and making it securely available for development,” Minister Rosso said.
This program aims to foster collaboration between customary landowners, State leaseholders, freehold land title holders, the private sector, financial institutions, and development partners.
The ultimate goal is to grow the economy and create income, wealth, and job opportunities.
The government has appropriated and allocated funding to acquire land in towns and cities to expand the stock of State land through this program.
The program, which commenced in 2023, has already seen significant financial commitments.
In 2023, K150 million was appropriated in the national budget, with K146.88 million warranted. While 2024 and 2025 also saw K150 million appropriated, K90 million was warranted in each year, with K23 million from 2024 yet to be cleared by the Finance Department.
These funds are being put to work in various notable projects. In Port Moresby, the Department has partnered with the National Capital District and the Moresby North East District Development Authority to resettle working-class citizens at Farea. Similarly, in Lae, a collaboration with the Lae City Authority and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of PNG is making 2,000 residential allotments available at Bumayong.
A key lesson learned from the initial phases, particularly from the Tuhava Pilot Project, is the critical importance of trunk infrastructure.
“Land title without trunk infrastructure undermines the feasibility of the project,"" the Minister highlighted.
This understanding is now guiding projects like the subdivisional development at Laloki, where funding supports both land conversion to State leases and investment in crucial infrastructure.
The Nadzab Town Development Project is another major undertaking under the Land Partnership Program, with resources committed to securing land from customary landowners for its development. The program is also supporting vital social infrastructure, with the Department partnering to secure land on the West Coast of Bougainville for a brand-new hospital.
The direct impact on housing is a central focus of these reforms.
Minister Rosso emphasised his personal commitment to this issue, stating that: “Every Papua New Guinean deserves to have a decent roof over their heads.”
The Land Partnership Program Policy Framework is creatively guiding efforts to mobilise land for affordable housing in partnership with various landowners. The successful Tuhava project, for instance, is projected to supply 4,000 houses upon full development, with a modified version at Laloki expected to add another 1,000 homes.
The Department has also supported Nambawan Super Limited (NSL) in developing 250 hectares of State land at Buswara, contributing to the affordable housing supply in Port Moresby. Similar collaborations are underway in Lae and Kokopo with Comrade Trustee and the Lutheran and Catholic Churches, respectively.
While acknowledging the persistent challenges in providing affordable housing, Minister Rosso believes that pragmatic, creative, and “outside the box” thinking is starting to make a difference.
The long-term vision is to free up land for development across the country, linking these initiatives to nation-building efforts such as Special Economic Zones, Connect PNG, and large-scale agricultural development. The early signs are promising, and the lessons learned from the Land Partnership Program will be crucial for its continued improvement and expansion.
As PNG approaches its 50th Independence Anniversary, these land reforms represent a significant step towards a more prosperous and equitably housed future.","Development, Trust",Development,Trust

Speaking at this morning’s Resources Summit at APEC Haus, in Port Moresby, Paita said in his tenure as mining minister, he will ensure that they get the Wafi-Golpu project, in Morobe Province, off the ground.
“We will ensure that the Community Development Agreement (CDA) for Porgera goes through so that we can have the community engaged in the lifeline of that project,” Paita told a packed conference room.
“I want to elevate Frieda River, through Cabinet, up to a State Negotiating Team so they can start discussing on Frieda.
“We want to start discussions on how we can help Kainantu mine with some of the ongoing landowner issues and the memorandum of agreement. So that, we get them up to speed and their expansion plan as well, including Ramu 2. They want to expand. We want to engage the provincial government, the local leaders and the company as well so that we can see how we can move that into an SML (Special Mining Lease) through its corrective procedures.”
The Minister said the State is also looking at granting an exploration licence for places like Mt Kare and other submissions that have been accumulating at the mining ministry.
“I want to assure the industry that we will expedite in our time so that we can start some of these projects.”
These large-scale projects mentioned by Minister Paita are in the pipeline, with the Wafi-Golpu gold-copper project and Frieda River copper-gold project yet to commence operations.

Law reform to let women to mine underground,31/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5470,"Women will soon be allowed to work underground in the mining sector, once the Mining (Safety) Act 1977 is amended.
Mining Minister, Rainbo Paita, revealed this morning that the national government is looking at making several reforms in the Mining Act, in close collaboration with the PNG Chamber of Resources and Energy.
Paita was speaking at the Resources Summit at APEC Haus, a culmination of the month-long 2025 PNG Resources Week.
“I will bring a small amendment for us to bring that through so that our women can be engaged in the underground mines as well,” Paita told a packed room filled with representatives from national and provincial governments, landowner leaders, resource developers, civil society, and the broader business community.
“That issue was brought to us in Parliament. I think it came about for health reasons and at the same time, Papua New Guinea, being a superstitious country, believed that women should not go underground.
“But now, we are a Christian country so we know that women can go underground,” he jokingly said as the room filled with light laughter.
“Most of you will be part of those reforms and I put to record for PNG CORE as well.
Our attempts to amend the mining act will not be done secretly. We will continue to have engagements so that everyone feels comfortable.”
The government intends to amend section 23(2) of the Mining (Safety) Act 1977, which states: “In no case shall a female be employed or work underground.”
This law was recently described as “outdated” by Morobe Governor Luther Wenge during a visit to the K92 Mine in Eastern Highlands Province.
A similar sentiment was shared earlier by the Mineral Resources Authority managing director, Jerry Garry, who alluded to the advances in technology that minimises hazards, as well as the high number of women who trained to be professional mining engineers and geologists, but had to be “pulled out because of the law”.","Society, Joy",Society,Joy

The Digicel Foundation has officially launched a staff-led initiative under the Men of Honor program, aimed at promoting positive change and addressing gender-based violence and child protection across Papua New Guinea. This initiative, which began earlier this year, focuses on empowering men—many of them Digicel PNG employees—to become Community Ambassadors who lead with integrity, empathy, and accountability.
Recognizing the importance of inclusive dialogue and proactive leadership, the Foundation is engaging men as key partners in fostering safer, more respectful communities. Participants voluntarily take part in a four-day training program developed and facilitated by the Foundation, which emphasizes personal growth, leadership development, and social responsibility.

“We’ve always believed that creating safe communities is a shared responsibility.
This program is not about blame—it’s about building capacity and inspiring leadership. When our staff step forward to champion values like respect, safety, and equality, they set a powerful example. Real change starts from within.
We are proud of our team members who have embraced this journey with courage and humility. These are more than just training sessions—they are transformative experiences. We’ve created a space where men can lead with compassion and strength, both at work and at home.”
The training encourages self-reflection and open dialogue, helping participants unlearn harmful behaviors and adopt non-violent, inclusive approaches to leadership. Graduates of the program become Ambassadors of Accountability, committed to fostering positive change through example, conversation, and community engagement.
Since its inception, the program has trained over 100 ambassadors across the country, with Digicel staff playing a central role in driving impact at the grassroots level. These ambassadors are helping to create safe spaces for discussion, break cycles of harm, and model respectful behavior in their communities.
The Digicel Foundation welcomes support and collaboration from the public, civil society, and other organizations in this growing national movement—one that redefines leadership through personal responsibility and community-driven change.","Social, Trust",Social,Trust

Clamp down on illegal mining activities,29/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5435,"PNG’s small-scale mining sector has largely been unregulated until recently.
In a first for the country, 11 Chinese nationals are being prosecuted under section 167 of the Mining Act 1992.
These foreign workers were apprehended in Wau, Morobe Province, for unauthorised alluvial mining using machinery.
The small-scale mining manager from the Mineral Resources Authority, Andrew Onguglo, assured attendees during today’s CANCONEX session at APEC Haus that enforcement is currently underway.
“The mining act, actually, now has teeth to bite,” Onguglo said in this morning’s session 5B on ‘small scale mining’.
“Before, we had a lot of non-compliance, illegal works. Now, any breach is directly a police matter.
“They will be arrested, equipment confiscated, they will be charged, they will go for court.”
He drew attention to the stop work order that was published by the regulator, Mineral Resources Authority, on June 4, 2025.
The public notice was to “all persons and companies carrying out unauthorised alluvial mining operations within alluvial mining districts, and in other areas in Papua New Guinea”.
Onguglo presented that the MRA has, so far, received reports of 66 unauthorised alluvial mining operations using heavy machinery.
“The notice itself is very serious,” he continued.
“One strike and you are gone.
“The international developers that come in; once you are arrested, you have breached your work permit and visa condition. So, you can be deported easily.
“That notice has been put forward to protect this sector because there are claims that this sector has been doing well but we are not seeing the revenue going up, the production going up.
“Where are the gold going?
“So, these are some attempts to put in place some controls in any dealings involving this sector.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

New PX Airbus to arrive in September,28/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5407,"Prime Minister James Marape has welcomed the September 2025 arrival of Air Niugini’s first Airbus A220 aircraft.
He described this as a landmark moment in the modernisation of Papua New Guinea’s aviation sector and a boost to national unity as the country marks 50 years of Independence.
The new-generation jet aircraft will operate on domestic services to five key airports that have been upgraded to handle its operational and safety requirements.
“As we celebrate our 50th anniversary as an independent nation, this new aircraft represents the kind of modern Papua New Guinea we are building — connected, confident and ready to grow,” said Prime Minister Marape.
“This is about more than just new planes; it’s about linking our people, markets, and opportunities.”
The Airbus A220 will begin scheduled services from September 2025 to the following five jet-capable airports:
1.	Jacksons International Airport (Port Moresby)
2.	Nadzab Tomodachi International Airport (Lae, Morobe)
3.	Kavieng Airport (New Ireland)
4.	Momote Airport (Manus)
5.	Gurney Airport (Alotau, Milne Bay)
These airports have met National Airports Corporation (NAC) and Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA PNG) standards for runway length, strength, and safety — including reinforced asphalt concrete surfaces that allow for jet operations in all weather conditions.
The Prime Minister Marape also noted that the Airbus A220 offers:
- Fuel savings and sustainability – Up to 25% less fuel consumption per seat
- Quieter and cleaner operations – Compatible with sustainable aviation fuels
- Improved passenger experience – Spacious cabin, large windows, lower noise and vibration
- Support for regional economies – More frequent and efficient flights to growth centres
“This aircraft helps take back PNG skies for PNG people. We want a safe, modern and affordable aviation sector that supports our economy and opens up opportunities across our islands and mountains,” the Prime Minister said.
Marape commended State-Owned Enterprises Minister, William Duma, Kumul Consolidated Holdings (KCH) and Air Niugini for their leadership in securing the new Airbus A220 fleet.
The Airbus A220s will progressively replace Air Niugini’s aging Fokker fleet.

‘Future of gold’ to be discussed,25/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5378,"The third day of PNG Resources Week 2025 will feature a pivotal session titled “Future of Gold”.
The session, scheduled for Wednesday, July 30th, will focus on the future of gold globally, and how PNG can take advantage of gold trends, including in refining, minting, and in management of gold reserves.
Hosted at APEC Haus, in Port Moresby, the session will bring together key voices from the gold sector, including David Toua, Chairman of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, and chief executive oficers from leading gold companies operating in the country, including Kumul Minerals CEO Saramu Kanu, K92 CEO John Lewins and St Barbara CEO, Andrew Strelein, as well as Managing Director of regulator, Mineral Resources Authority, Jerry Garry.
Toua will provide insights into the Central Bank’s evolving role in managing gold reserves and its broader monetary responsibilities, particularly as Papua New Guinea explores new frameworks for gold governance.
His remarks are expected to touch on the importance of maintaining institutional independence and financial stability in the face of emerging challenges and opportunities in the sector.
The session will also feature perspectives from executives representing major gold producers in the country, where the CEOs of these operations will share their views on the operational landscape, investment climate, and the strategic direction of PNG’s gold industry.
In parallel, Kumul Minerals Holdings Limited is advancing plans for a national gold refinery, which could process up to three million ounces of gold annually. The proposed facility, estimated to cost K60 million, is undergoing feasibility assessments for locations in Lae or Port Moresby.
This initiative reflects a growing emphasis on domestic value-adding and national ownership in the gold supply chain, aligning with the government’s broader “Take Back PNG” agenda.
As PNG celebrates 50 years of independence, the “Future of Gold” session will offer a timely reflection on the sector’s legacy and its evolving role in shaping the country’s economic future.

High cost of coffee production for local farmers,24/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5361,"Coffee is one of the most significant exports in Papua New Guinea.
In 2021, PNG exported approximately 40,742 metric tonnes of unroasted coffee worth K641, most of which were from the rural farmers.
Despite coffee’s substantial contribution
Koki Biam is a coffee farmer from Teptep, in Madang Province. He highlighted that transport is a big challenge, considering they live between the borders of Morobe and Madang.
to the country’s foreign exchange earnings and gross domestic product, most rural farmers continue to struggle in an area devoid of government services, especially poor infrastructure, no market accessibility, lack of financial support and a significant neglect in education and healthcare services.
Farmers like Biam live in extremely rugged, mountainous terrains, where the only effective mode of transport is by air.
“There is no road here so we have to travel by air,” said Biam.
“We sell good coffee but the cost of air travel eats into our income.
“Added to that is the price of coffee. We are in the (Tree Kangaroo) Conservation market hence we have no oversight on the actual money generated from our produce.
“Also, we used to commission a trade store nearby to store our coffee bags. Now, with a new storage facility, we are relieved. That used to be a major burden; where to safely store our coffee
Farmers from Teptep usually sell an average of 70 bags of premium coffee to the Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program, or TKCP, at a price of K3-K6 for a bag.
“Last year we got K6. We sell our bags to TKCP, who then export them to the US specialty markets. Some of our coffees were sent to Zoos Victoria while others were sent to Woodland Park Zoo in the US. Once they sell them, they give us our share.
“We know we should make a lot of money, but most of it is spent on airfreight. Going down to Lae, vehicles have to be paid, then the mill has to be paid as well. Only a small amount that is left is given to us, farmers.”
The fluctuating prices, the high cost of airfreight and the long waiting period to get their money has discouraged most farmers from continuing with coffee production.
“We work hard, but we get less,” shared the coffee farmer.","Business, Sadness",Business,Sadness
K1mil coffee support for Teptep,22/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5333,"Coffee has always been the lifeline for many rural and inaccessible areas of PNG.
Even with no government support, local farmers always find ways to move their coffee bags to the nearest market or to ship to other parts of the country, as well as overseas.
The perserverance of the communities in Teptep and Kabwum has paid off, with a K1 million support given to them through the World Bank funded PNG Commercialization and Diversification Project (PACD), managed by the Coffee Industry Corporation (CIC).
Teptep, in Madang's  Raicoast district, is one of the province’s least developed – and forgotten – coffee growing community, until a recent visit by the Coffee Industry Corporation.
The atmosphere was one of jubilation and hope as locals with painted faces welcomed the led by project manager, Potaisa Hombunaka.
Hombunaka was on ground to announce K1 million worth of support that will benefit 500 rural communities in the Teptep and Kabwum areas. These communities straddle the borders of Madang and Morobe.
“Coffee came through Finschhafen with the gospel,” said Hombunaka. “It’s only fair that with this loan that has been taken out by the government, the project has to be given to our people in the remotest parts of the country.
“Why? Because even without government support or without this project funding here, coffee from Raicoast, Teptep, Kabwum and Finschhafen still found its own way to Lae then got shipped overseas.”
The Teptep area is extremely rugged, with the only effective mode of transport being by plane or chopper.
Alphy Sammy, from the PNG Commercialization and Diversification Project, detailed that they are focusing on Teptep due to the high “cup profile” of coffee there.
“Coffee has been farmed here for over 27 years, as per the information we received from the people on the ground,” stated Sammy. “Nothing of such project has come about in the last 27 years; this is a first-of-its-kind.
“We have taken a deliberate decision from our project manager to work with the remote coffee farmers in the remote areas basically because of the cup profile it has in this part of the area. The coffee coming out from this area has a very high cup profile and can be marketable in the niche markets, specialty markets.”
The project is being carried out in partnership with the Tree Kangaroo Conservation Program. TKCP has been helping farmers to produce coffee for specialty markets overseas.
The K1 million assistance to the communities includes coffee curriculum for schools, farming equipment and expert support","Development, Joy",Development,Joy
Robusta coffee projects recognized,21/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5325,"The Coffee Industry Corporation (CIC) launched several of its Robusta coffee projects at the Omuru Research Station in Madang Province on Friday, July 11, 2025.
CIC Chief Executive Officer Charles Dambui, Chief Operations Officer Steven Tumae and Coffee Ministry’s First Secretary John Kambua officially launched the projects.
Dambui thanked the national government for recognizing the importance of the coffee industry and for creating a ministry for coffee under the leadership of Hon. William Bando has seen important coffee interventions as this being implemented.
Projects launched included: the Omuru 1 Robusta coffee variety, Omuru 1 clone garden, 6Ha Robusta coffee developed using somatic embryogenesis technique, eco-friendly seed pulper for seed production and the Amelle-Omuru road upgrade under the National Coffee Road Access Program. The occasion also witnessed the presentation of 128 certificates to Robusta coffee farmers of Badam Coffee Cooperative.
“I thank the government for its support to bring this research station back to life, and I acknowledge all the hard-working scientists and staff under the Research and Innovation Program of CIC for all your dedication and efforts to be able to launch all these Robusta Coffee projects today.”
Dambui added that CIC would now prioritize upgrading the 5.4-kilometer road from the main road leading into the Omuru Research Station under the national coffee access road program supported by the government.
“By next week we will put out an advertisement for a contractor to bid to upgrade this road,” he said.
Dambui said that with this expected support to the research station, research staff and scientists would be sent to Omuru to conduct important research into Robusta coffee production and to upscale Robusta production.
CIC-PACD Project Manager Potaisa Hombunaka thanked the people of Amelle and Omuru for availing their land to the government for Didiman work.
Hombunaka highlighted that Robusta coffee’s contribution of 5 percent against Arabica coffees 95% must not be seen as insignificant, but the number of households involved in Robusta coffee production is important.
“We must continue to support Robusta coffee development research. Robusta coffee price is almost equivalent or even better than Arabica coffee. The potential is there and if we work hard, we can grow the Robusta coffee industry to over K100m-K200m from Robusta alone.”
He added that farmers in the most rural parts of this country must be fairly supported, as that is where you will see productivity. Hombunaka said without research, there would be no industry.
“We must support research as it is the backbone in any agricultural intervention.”
CIC Chief Operations Officer Steven Tumae said that partnership with provincial and district administrations is the way forward and CIC’s focus into new growth areas such as SHP, Hela, Enga, Milne Bay, Central, Autonomous Region of Bougainville, and in Madang is no mistake to help rural farmers.
First Secretary to the Coffee Minister, John Kambua congratulated the Omuru community in taking the initiative to learn the new technique from CIC technical officers, and to germinate the Omuru 1 coffee seedlings using the Somatic Embryogenesis technology. He encouraged the farmers to grow at least 1Ha of Robusta coffee each to reap the benefits of their hard work in the near future.
The land in Omuru where the current CIC Research Station is located was given in 1958 by the landowners to conduct trials for coconut. As time went by, cocoa experiments were also done at this government station before coffee research took over. The facility is situated about 25 kilometers from Madang town in the South Ambenob local level government.
Ward 19 councilor of South Ambenob, Lumundu Ulu, urged the local community to change their attitude and welcome development such as this into the area and to take ownership of the project.
“Today, coffee research is coming in and our attitudes must change. We, the Amelle have not even changed and it is our time to change for the better. I appeal to wards 16, 19, 20, 21 and 23 in South Ambenob that this is now our time to make a difference.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

K4 million for coffee freight support,21/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5319,"Coffee Minister William Bando launched the Coffee Freight Surety Scheme (FSS), a flagship program of the Coffee Industry Corporation (CIC), on the weekend.
The initiative follows recent K4 million funding support from the National Government.
The small but significant occasion was attended by partners from shipping agencies, third-level airlines, farmers, and representatives from both the CIC and the Coffee Ministry at the Niugini Aviation Services Ltd. Hangar in Mt. Hagen.
Minister Bando acknowledged the funding support by the national government after a year without funding for the FSS program under CIC.
“This program supports not just a policy, but a promise to leave no farmer behind. It is about connecting the most remote coffee-growing communities to the national and global markets,” Bando said.
Bando said the funding support will include payments to third-level airlines for dedicated coffee flights, payments to shipping operators for coastal and island transportation, fuel subsidies, operational support, and freighter maintenance incentives.
A total of K2.1 million was presented by the Coffee Minister to the airfreight and shipping agencies, including Adventist Aviation Services, MAF, Kobio, Niugini Aviation Services Ltd, SIL, Air Sanga, Aerodynamic, Lutheran Shipping Agency, JJ Shipping, Consort Shipping, and Pomio Development Agency.
He added that the remaining funding would be distributed to those who increase coffee bag exports after proper checks and acquittals are completed.
The Minister also emphasized that, with the K20 million Coffee Development Funding received this year, he is committed to continuing support for the FSS program to ensure more coffee bags are produced, helping to meet the government’s targets.
Bando said that moving forward, there should be more communication and agreements between the District Development Authorities, CIC, and the airfreight and shipping companies to work together in serving the remote farmers.
“I am appealing to local leaders in coffee-growing provinces to come forward and partner with CIC and the freight agencies. For us, it is a community social obligation. We have no return on our efforts. However, for you MPs, you need to collaborate with us to reach out to your people.
“Through this program, we are putting more money into the pockets of our rural farmers, reducing coffee due to spoilage and poor logistics, promoting rural empowerment and SME growth, and strengthening PNG’s position in the global coffee market.”
CIC Chief Executive Officer Charles Dambui said in 2023, K1 million was invested in the FSS program, and the return on the investment was K7 million.
“That is how effective the program is that is serving and touching the lives of the rural marginalized people.”
Dambui urged local leaders in respective coffee-growing provinces to come forward and partner with CIC and its partners to better serve remote farmers.
CIC Chief Operations Officer Steven Tumae emphasized the importance of working together with partners and combining resources to serve farmers in the inaccessible areas of the country.
“Our people deserved to be treated as Papua New Guineans. I thank the government for this support that will go a long way to help our disadvantaged farmers.”
Meanwhile, the FSS program has been supporting 50 airstrips, 10 jetties and 7 wharves in 13 provinces covering 24 districts.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
Aopi appointed KPHL Board Chairman,21/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5317,"Prime Minister James Marape has announced the appointment of Mr Gerea Aopi as the new Chairman of the Board of Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL), as the Government moves swiftly to address serious governance concerns raised in a recent Australian media report.
Mr Aopi’s appointment was made prior to the emergence of these allegations, but Prime Minister Marape said the timing now presents an important opportunity for the new Chairman to lead a full and independent review of the issues raised. “Gerea Aopi is a man of experience, integrity and professionalism in the oil and gas sector,” said the Prime Minister.
“He has been appointed to lead the Kumul Petroleum Board at a time when our national oil and gas company needs credible, steady leadership to uphold its integrity and reputation.” The Prime Minister confirmed that he has written to the media outlet in question requesting all materials and investigative findings relating to the allegations. He has also written to the Managing Director of Kumul Petroleum, Mr Wapu Sonk, requesting a formal response and clarification on the matters raised.
“As Trustee Shareholder, I have a responsibility to protect the interests of our country and our people,” said Mr Marape. “The letter to the Managing Director will seek clarity on his position in light of the issues reported.” Mr Marape also urged the public to exercise restraint in passing judgment.
“These matters were raised by the Australian press and are now under international scrutiny. But let me be clear — Mr Wapu Sonk, like any citizen, is innocent until proven otherwise. In the past, Papua New Guinean leaders have been wrongly scrutinised in the media, only to be vindicated later. One such example is the successful legal challenge brought by Minister William Duma.
“This is not a witch hunt. It is about governance, transparency, and protecting the reputation of Kumul Petroleum, which is a key institution of our economy and has international relationships to maintain.” The Prime Minister stressed that all State-Owned Enterprises, their CEOs, and department heads must operate at the highest standard of ethical conduct.
“If you are entrusted with leading a State institution — whether as a departmental head, CEO, or managing director — your personal and professional conduct must be beyond reproach.
There is no room for impropriety. Our SOEs must be models of transparency and good governance.” He emphasised that in the modern world, especially in countries like Australia and Papua New Guinea, all financial transactions leave digital footprints and are subject to scrutiny.
“In today’s global economy, no transaction goes unseen. Every financial movement can be traced. If these allegations have any merit, they will be proven. If not, then they will be dismissed. But either way, we must allow proper processes to take place.”
Prime Minister Marape also called on Papua New Guineans — including those on social media — to refrain from making personal attacks or speculating prematurely.
“I appeal to all citizens, especially those on social media, to refrain from rushing to judgment or publishing personal opinions without facts. Kumul Petroleum’s reputation is at stake, and so is the national interest. We must protect that reputation while the investigation proceeds.”
He acknowledged that the matter is a setback, especially as the Government has been actively lobbying for greater international investment in PNG’s energy sector.
“This unfortunate episode comes at a time when we are engaging with global partners to expand PNG’s oil and gas capacity — including projects like Papua LNG, P’nyang, and Pasca A. It is vital we restore trust and credibility as soon as possible so that our development ambitions are not undermined.”
Prime Minister Marape concluded by reiterating that the Government will act firmly, fairly and transparently.
“This matter must be resolved quickly, clearly, and professionally. I expect a preliminary report on my desk when I return to Port Moresby on Wednesday.
The people of Papua New Guinea deserve accountability, and the Government will ensure that this issue is handled with integrity and in the national interest.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Papua New Guinea’s largest savings and loan society, NCSL and New Britain Palm Oil Ltd (NBPOL) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), forming a partnership to improving financial inclusion for smallholder growers and employees.
The signing was held in Kimbe recently and attended by senior managers and executives from both organisations. NBPOL was represented by Tan Tee Ung, Head of Oil Palm Operations and Wilfred Tangole, Head of Small Growers.
NCSL Chief Executive Officer, Frans Kootte signed on behalf of the Society, and in attendance was NCSL’s Chief Member Services Officer, Maranuf Tataeng, forming a partnership aimed at improving financial inclusion for smallholder growers and employees.
The collaboration aims to provide growers and staff with fee-free savings, affordable loan access, and mobile banking convenience. NCSL’s presence in Kimbe, Bialla, and now the Hargy Corporate Office ensures local availability of services.
Mr. Kootte highlighted the significance of accessible digital services, stating the importance of digital access for its financial members directly from their smartphones.
“We recently introduced an app for smartphones so our members can access financial services directly from their devices, without the need to visit a branch. We've also increased our savings rates to ensure members enjoy better returns on their contributions,” he said.
This partnership marks the beginning of a new era of financial inclusion and empowerment for the smallholder growers and employees of NBPOL.
Mr Ung on behalf of NBPOL stated, “We look forward to the successful rollout of this initiative and the positive impact it will have on the lives of our growers, their families, and the wider community.”
He expressed confidence in the partnership, stating that this initiative holds promise for thousands of growers, their families, and communities and thanked NCSL for its leadership in financial innovation.
To complement this expansion, NCSL plans to roll out financial literacy awareness programs targeted at NBPOL’s smallholder growers and employees. These sessions will empower individuals to make informed financial decisions and manage resources more effectively.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
Empowered with financial literacy,15/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5234,"Twenty People With Disabilities (PWDs) within the Rabaul Urban LLG (RULLG), in East New Britain Province, have been equipped with financial literacy skills following a four-day training.
The training, facilitated by the RULLG community development office, was recently conducted at the Rabaul Urban conference room, and was coordinated through the district social sector.
When giving a brief update of the program, the RULLG community development officer, Rum Minicus, said the financial literacy training was piloted last year by RULLG and is focused on essential skills such as basic book keeping, budgeting and saving.
“Most of these PWDs living in town have their roadside markets or are sometimes engaged in fishing, gardening, assisting with errands and other economic activities that they are capable of doing; however, managing their little income is still a challenge,” outlined Minicus.
She said most of the time, they feel left out of such vital programs and other developments. Hence, such training will help to empower them.
Meantime, Long Uradok, a participant and chairman of the Rabaul Town Disability Association, expressed his gratitude for the training.
“I have been in this wheelchair all my life, and it’s my means of transport. I do my errands and do mobile sales whenever I can,” he shared.
“When cruise ships visit Rabaul, I usually volunteer to help with tour guides in exchange for a few dollars.”
Uradok said such trainings will help them to manage the income that they make, as well as foster a more inclusive community for all.
The financial literacy training for PWDs will also be carried out in the other LLGs next month.","Community, Joy",Community,Joy
Women in Resources and Energy committee launched,15/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5230,"A step towards gender equity in Papua New Guinea’s mining, petroleum, and energy sectors was taken on Monday, July 14, with the launch of the Women in Resources and Energy (WIRE) Committee. An initiative by the PNG Chamber of Resources & Energy (PNG CORE).
As PNG celebrates 50 years of nationhood and industrial growth, the resources sector continues to evolve. While more women are entering technical and managerial roles, gender representation remains uneven, particularly in operational, trade, and underground environments. Many women still face cultural, structural, and safety-related challenges that hinder their full participation.
To address these challenges, PNG CORE has established the WIRE Committee to champion diversity, drive systemic change, and support women across all levels of the sector.
“Today marks more than just the formation of a new committee. It signals a shared commitment to building a more inclusive, resilient, and future-ready resources sector for Papua New Guinea,” said Karo Maha, Chair of the WIRE Committee and Country Manager of New Porgera Limited.
“WIRE is not just about women-it’s about equity across the entire workforce. It’s about recognising the silent achievers, especially the women working in underground mines in other parts of the world, on offshore rigs, if we do have in this country, in remote gas fields, and those in trade and technical roles who are often unseen but essential.”
The Committee will serve as a collaborative platform to celebrate achievements, identify persistent barriers, and promote practical, industry-driven solutions that benefit not only women but the broader workforce and communities linked to the resources sector.
WIRE Committee Objectives:
• Promote women’s participation in STEM, trades, and leadership roles.
• Identify and address barriers to gender equity in the workplace.
• Recognise and elevate silent achievers, including women in underground, field, and frontline roles.
• Foster a safe, respectful, and inclusive industry culture.
• Advocate for policy change, including lifting the prohibition on women working underground.
The initiative builds on the efforts of leading resource companies such as ExxonMobil PNG (EMPNG), Ok Tedi Mining Limited, Newmont, New Porgera, K92 Mining, and Santos, who have already introduced meaningful programs to advance women across mining operations, oil rigs, gas fields, engineering, and more.
The launch included a panel discussion with 12 speakers from 11 different companies. The panel called on the National Government to fast-track the enactment of the new Mining (Safety) Act and regulations, which are 50+ years old.
There is general alignment between industry and the Government on the changes to the Mining (Safety) Act and regulations, which should be brought to Parliament as soon as possible.
The launch of the WIRE Committee reinforces PNG CORE’s commitment to building a more inclusive, resilient, and future-ready resources industry for Papua New Guinea.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

The result marked a 43 per cent increase from Q2 2024 and positions K92 well to deliver its annual operational production guidance of 160,000 to 185,000 oz AuEq.

MSMEs highlighted at International Day,08/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5142,"Coinciding with International MSME Day, the inaugural Business Link Pacific (BLP) Advisory Panel Meeting was held recently, bringing together key stakeholders, financial institutions, development partners, and SME owners to recognize BLP’s role in advancing small and medium-sized enterprises in Papua New Guinea.
The meeting highlighted the important role of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in Papua New Guinea’s economic growth and the contribution of the New Zealand-funded programme, BLP, in supporting MSME development.
His Excellency Peter Zwart, New Zealand High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, delivered opening remarks describing the SME sector as a cornerstone for inclusive and broad-based economic development. He emphasized that while large-scale resource extraction and public sector activities were important, it was SME that offered greatest potential to grow employment and opportunity for the majority of Papua New Guineans.
“SMEs are essential for achieving national economic goals, connecting rural communities to markets and providing viable livelihoods for women, youth and those traditionally excluded from formal employment.”
He commended BLP’s integrated approach to business advisory and financial services, encouraged continued ambition and adaptability.
Acting Executive Director of the Centre for Excellence in Financial Inclusion (CEFI), Peter Samuel, delivered the closing remarks, highlighting BLP as a uniquely practical and operational model that bridges a major gap in the government’s support mechanisms for SMEs.
He acknowledged that although CEFI’s traditional focus is not SME development, the success stories shared during the meeting offered a compelling case to expand their mandate.
“The journey of Richard, who turned a roadside hobby into a top-tier restaurant, demonstrates the kind of passion, perseverance, and structural support our SMEs need,” he said.
Mr Samuel stressed the need for future sessions to include both success stories and those still struggling, stating that learning from both triumph and hardship would better inform policy and practice. He also encouraged financial institutions to reflect more deeply on their relationship with SME clients and their unique challenges.
The meeting also featured a testimony sharing session, where four local SME owners shared how BLP had positively impacted their businesses.
Mrs. Kopi Like-Grammon, owner of KLG & Co. Business Consultants, shared her journey as a Business Advisor since 2019.
“Through BLP, I’ve supported many businesses to formalize helping them register, set up bookkeeping systems, and transition to cloud accounting,” she explained.
“We’ve worked closely with institutions like CEFI and banks to ensure our clients are compliant and loan-ready. Patience and compliance are key for long-term success.”
Founder of Abus Na Kumu, Richard Mark shared how a BLP grant transformed his food venture.
“With close to half a million kina in BLP grant funding (used as loan equity), we went from selling food by the roadside to building one of PNG’s leading catering businesses,” he said. “BLP trusted and believed in us. Their support connected us with financial and accounting experts, and helped build a resilient and sustainable foundation.”
Billy Gawi, a wood carver and designer, recounted how a K30,000 loan from Women’s Micro Bank, facilitated through BLP funding, kept his small business afloat. “I now employ 36 young people from Port Moresby in places like Eight Mile and Kuriva. Our carvings are sold at Boroko Market and even government departments,” he said.
“More than just business, we train unemployed youth, paying their wages and school fees.”
Benitta Napitalai, Owner of Qweens Collection, described how BLP’s subsidy supported her bilum-making enterprise.
“Our business needed an online platform to reach more markets. With BLP’s subsidy, we worked with SNS Technology to build an integrated e-commerce website. Now, we’ve attracted customers from Australia and New Zealand, creating income for women in the Eastern Highlands,” she shared.
Mr. Richard Busby, BLP’s Senior SME Banking Specialist, provided an update on BLP’s progress and plans. He acknowledged BLP’s strong collaboration with its two key banking partners in Papua New Guinea, and their instrumental role in delivering concessional and wholesale capital loan programmes to SMEs.
“We’ve seen the successful rollout of several SME loans and the upcoming launch of two new energy finance products,” he said. “These initiatives, including green and renewable energy financing, reflect BLP’s goal to unlock access to finance.”
Mr Busby also praised the in-country BLP team for their coordination and outreach, particularly in regions such as the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.
From the banking sector, Wong Khar Fye, General Manager for SME & Specialized Lending at Kina Bank, outlined Kina’s partnership with BLP, which began in 2021.
“As a bank that started small, we understand the struggles of SMEs. Our partnership with BLP allowed us to refer clients to BLP advisors when they weren’t ready for a loan, giving them a chance to come back stronger,” he said.
Mr Fye announced that Kina Bank had supported nearly 30 SMEs with K3 million in lending and unveiled two upcoming products, SME Green and SME Every Business Loan, which will align with BLP’s concessional lending framework.
Also addressing the gathering was Prabhash Ranjan from Women’s Micro Bank, who highlighted the bank’s focus on women entrepreneurs, who make up 80 percent of their 130,000-strong customer base.
“Our partnership with BLP enables us to do more than offer loans. We support clients with business advisory services, capacity building, and financial literacy,” he stated. “From catering to tourism, retail to renewable energy, the collaboration has helped businesses across PNG. We encourage SMEs to continue innovating and engaging with us.”
The meeting also featured presentations by Smitha Shanberg, BLP’s Business & Stakeholder Manager, and Gabriel Iso, Lae-based BLP Business Services Manager, who provided updates on ongoing regional outreach and capacity-building efforts across the regions.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

PNG CORE President Anthony Smaré praised NPL’s achievements, noting that the company has delivered tangible results in its first full quarter of operations.
“Congratulations to the management, staff, shareholders and stakeholders that have contributed to this strong quarter by New Porgera Limited. It’s wonderful to see this great mine producing again and contributing to its host communities, Enga Province, the Highlands business ecosystem and the country again.
“This has been the result of tremendous hard work by the NPL team and their partners, showing grit and resilience in a challenging condition - and they should be proud of their performance. The company’s delivery of 84,800 ounces of gold, declaration of an 80 million US dollar dividend, and payment of 48.9 million US dollars in corporate tax are remarkable outcomes that benefit our economy and our people.”
He also acknowledged the successful connection of the Mulitaka Bypass Road, which has significantly improved logistical access and demonstrated NPL’s commitment to overcoming infrastructure challenges in remote regions.

"NPL declares dividend, pays K199m in corporate tax",02/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5068,"New Porgera Limited today paid K198.9 million as corporate tax to the Internal Revenue Commission today.
Prime Minister James Marape commended New Porgera Limited (NPL) for its outstanding performance in the first quarter of 2025, highlighting the company as a model for responsible resource development and equitable partnerships in Papua New Guinea.
NPL’s Q1 report shows that the company poured 84,800 ounces of gold, successfully delivering on its operational budget. This was achieved alongside the connection of the critical Mulitaka Bypass Road, demonstrating the company’s commitment to overcoming logistical and infrastructure challenges.
“I commend NPL and our partners at Barrick for demonstrating that this new model — 51% PNG-owned, including 15% for landowners — is not only possible but is already producing results,” said Marape.
“In just one quarter, NPL has declared an 80 million US dollar dividend and paid 46.7 million US dollars in corporate tax, which is a significant contribution to our economy.”
The Prime Minister described the early success of the restructured Porgera mine as a major national achievement and a testament to his government’s policy of securing greater value from the country’s natural resources.
“When the original Special Mining Lease (SML 1) expired, we made the bold decision to close the mine and renegotiate for better terms. Many doubted us. But today, we have a 51% national stake, with real equity for landowners and the State, and results to show for it,” he said.
“This is not just a mine reopening — it is a symbol of PNG’s sovereignty over its resources, negotiated in the 50th year of our Independence, and delivering real dividends for our people.”
The Prime Minister specifically thanked Barrick President and CEO, Mark Bristow for his leadership and vision.
“Mr Bristow is a true global citizen. He understood our desire for equitable ownership and supported our push for a deal where both PNG and our investment partners win.”
The Prime Minister further noted that under previous arrangements, similar projects failed to generate this level of return to the State and landowners.
“This shows what is possible when Papua New Guineans have real equity and strong management,” he said.
He also highlighted NPL’s contribution to employment and training:
-	2,811 employees, 97% of whom are Papua New Guinean nationals
-	43 industrial trainees hosted, helping build national workforce capacity
However, the Prime Minister also acknowledged the serious law and order issues reported in Q1, including:
-	33,499 intrusions into the mine area
-	11 armed robberies, including one shooting of an NPL employee
-	Ongoing highway accidents and logistical disruptions
“These law-and-order issues are unacceptable,” he stated.
“We are urgently reviewing the introduction of a Security Tax Credit Scheme and a Highway Tax Credit Scheme to support the company and local communities.”
The Prime Minister further called on landowners, the Enga Provincial Government, and all stakeholders to work closely with Minister for Mining Rainbo Paita, to finalise the Community Development Agreement (CDA).
“Only once the CDA is concluded will the equity benefits be transferred to the province and landowners. Until then, the funds will remain in escrow for accountability and transparency.”
Marape also appealed to the energy sector to assist in power supply solutions as gas reserves at Santos-Hides decline, stressing the need for coordinated national support to ensure ongoing production.
“This achievement at Porgera adds to our broader economic track record. Over the last four years, PNG has delivered average GDP growth of over 4% — a first in our history — with a strong anchor in agriculture and renewable resources.
“New Porgera Ltd is proof that responsible investment, national ownership, and strong leadership can coexist and thrive. It’s a shining example of what a reformed resource sector can look like when PNG takes charge of its destiny.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
Air Niugini transports live-fish to Japan,02/07/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/5064,"Air Niugini has for the first-time transported live fish export out of Port Moresby and Papua New Guinea on a direct flight to Hong Kong last Wednesday 25th June, marking a significant achievement in Papua New Guinea’s seafood export capabilities.

It also enables exporters to access high-value international markets, enhancing profitability and supporting the country’s economy.”
Mr Seddon also highlighted the specialized requirements for transporting live marine products: “There are specific handling protocols and regulatory compliances involved in the transportation of live marine products. Exporters interested in similar ventures should coordinate with Air Niugini Cargo well in advance to ensure all arrangements meet the necessary standards.”
This achievement underscores Air Niugini’s commitment to supporting Papua New Guinea’s export industries and expanding Papua New Guinea’s reach in global markets.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Over the next 12 months, Air Niugini will give priority to the disciplined delivery of the 2025– 2027 Corporate Plan, ensure aircraft arrive on time, financing is secured, and operational efficiencies are realised. This will be underpinned by investment in its people, in the systems and technical fleet readiness.
This was highlighted by Air Niugini Chief Executive Officer, Gary Seddon at the 40th Australia PNG Business Forum & Trade Expo which took place last week from the 23rd to 25th of June at the Stanley Hotel in Port Moresby.
The CEO participated in a roundtable on State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) sharing updates on Air Niugini's operations, performance, and strategic initiatives with a particular mention on the airline’s re-fleet program.
“Our focus on staff development and technological innovation, such as digital tools for performance analysis, supports our goal of delivering world-class service while managing rising fuel costs and other industry challenges. We recognize our vital role in connecting communities, supporting trade, and fostering tourism. Our investments in fleet modernization and operational efficiencies are designed to elevate PNG’s position as a regional hub and improve the lives of our people,” Mr Seddon said.
By September 2025, the airline will introduce the first of eleven Airbus A220 aircraft, marking a significant milestone in its US$700 million re-fleeting transformation program.
This initiative aims to replace 65% of the current fleet within four years, ensuring more efficient, reliable and environmentally friendly service. The new A220s are capable of landing at the domestic airports currently serviced by the Fokker and Boeing fleet. The A220 can also service international destinations, and will support the widebody fleet.
“Our pilot, engineering teams and cabin crew are progressing well with comprehensive training to ensure a seamless transition to A220 operations. The first aircraft is currently in the final assembly phase and will soon enter the painting process, with operational readiness targeted for September 2025. This upgrade could catalyse economic activity and social development across the country,” the CEO added.
Sale of tickets on the new aircraft will commence imminently.
However, Mr Seddon also pointed out the need for critical airport infrastructure upgrades, recognising the continued efforts of NAC, ADB and the PNG Government. These enhancements include extended runways, runway lighting, navigation aids, approach navigation and rescue firefighting equipment, key to enabling safe, reliable and around the clock operations.
The CEO made reference to the Lae route which now benefits from fit for purpose infrastructure and reliable Boeing aircraft, allowing multiple daily flights that support affordable fares and dependable schedules. Expanded runway and taxiway infrastructure in the future will expand opportunities for international routes from Nadzab Tomodachi airport.
With new aircraft arriving in September and ongoing infrastructure improvements, Air Niugini is committed to continue to provide safe, affordable, and reliable air services that meet the needs of our nation and its people. The airline remains dedicated to executing strategic initiatives effectively, ensuring PNG’s continued progress in the aviation industry and beyond.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

PNG set to transfer BCL shares to ABG,25/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4996,"The Marape-Rosso Government will this week announce the transfer of all shares owned by the Independent State of Papua New Guinea in Bougainville Copper Limited to the people of Bougainville.
Prime Minister James Marape is set to make the formal announcement at Government House this Thursday, 26 June 2025.
The shares worth over K140.3 million at current market value will be transferred to the Autonomous Bougainville Government.
The transfer follows the decision of the National Executive Council for the people of Bougainville to own the shares currently owned by the State.
The decision also meets the Joint Supervisory Body’s direction in its meeting on 12 March 2020 for the State’s 36.45 percent shareholding in BCL to be transferred to ABG.
The State currently holds 146,175,449 ordinary shares in BCL, representing a total of 36.45 percent of its issued capital, in two separate tranches of 19.06 and 17.39 percentages share respectively.
Prime Minister Marape said, “I am pleased to see us making progress in this matter. It is our expressed commitment to transfer the entirety of the 36.45 percent shareholding to the government of Bougainville so the landowners of Panguna and the people of Bougainville can benefit better in the mine.
“The people of Bougainville deserve our respect for hosting Panguna Mine which fully supported our economy for 13 years after Independence, from 1975 to 1987, well before any of our national resources became available.
“The transfer of the shareholding also complements this PANGU-led Government’s policies for Bougainville to be economically independent by raising its revenues internally to complement National Government grants as we prepare Bougainville’s future.
“On the 50th anniversary of Independence, this is a good gift to the people of Bougainville.
“I commend the ABG leadership of President Ishmael Toroama who also pushed for this to happen. This is a mutually reached decision on both sides that reflects on the work our two governments are undertaking for Bougainville,” Prime Minister Marape said.
The transfer of shares will now change the control of BCL, with ABG and the people of Bougainville assuming ownership of 72.9 percent of BCL’s issued capital. It is being carried out at no cost to ABG.
Bougainville Copper Limited is a publicly listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange and its share price is currently trading at $0.39 (thirty-nine cents) per share. The current market value of the shares being transferred to the people of Bougainville through their Autonomous Government is worth Au$54,742,705 which, when converted to PNG currency, is worth K140,365,511.","Politics, Joy",Politics,Joy

Ahi firm marks 10 years of growth,21/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4935,"One of Morobe’s landowner companies, Ahi Investment Ltd, is celebrating 10 years of growth since its incorporation in 2015.
Over 200 staff participated in a celebratory event on Tuesday, June 17th, at the Lae Inland Logistics yard.
Ahi Investment Ltd had initially started as Ahi Holdings on April 8th, 1994. The company was established to generate economic benefits for the six Ahi landowner villages of Butibam, Hengali, Kamkumung, Yanga, Wagang and Yalu.
Mismanagement led to the collapse of the company in 2010, and a legal battle ensued to return assets back to the rightful beneficiaries. This led to the eventual de-registration of Ahi Holdings that same year.
In 2015, Ahi Investment started on a clean slate, under new leadership.
This year marks 10 years of growth and progress for the landowner company, with the deputy chairman of the AIL board, Gae Galang, sharing that a decade ago, the company had only one wheel loader.
“AIL, one of our customary functions was with stevedoring, we established ourselves with stevedoring but now we have gone into properties and we are also the first landowner company to partner with Customs,” said Galang. “Our main focus there is for logistics and shipping.”
The landowner company has a diverse portfolio containing a number of joint-venture firms and wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Lae Inland Logistics, Coastal Industrial Services, Coastal Retail Services, Ahi Properties and Ahi Terminal Services.
AIL has been giving back to the community through the construction of new police stations for Omili and Malahang, the building of Wagang’s church, backpack and stationery distribution to students in the six Ahi villages, including the purchase of six 25-seater buses and fully-furnished portable offices in 2018.
In 2023, AIL presented its dividend pay totaling K1,570,000 to its trustee company, Ahi Prudential Development Limited. APDL holds shares on behalf of the registered traditional customary landowners of the six Ahi villages.
Galang stated that the dividend from 2024 was K2.7 million while they anticipate a higher amount this year.
To celebrate the 10th anniversary, a major sports tournament will be hosted next week for the six Ahi villages at Igam Barracks.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy

IMF releases K708 mil to PNG,17/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4898,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has announced the approval of the fourth review under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programmes, which will release K708 million (US$172 million) to Papua New Guinea.
In addition, PNG is also set to gain access to approximately US$ 28 million through the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) following the first review of the RSF arrangement.
The IMF released an official statement recognizing that PNG has made good progress toward reforms and that, partly due to this, PNG’s economic performance has been robust, and inflation has been contained.
Economic growth is expected to edge up to 4.7 per cent in 2025, supported by the resource and non-resource sectors.
IMF expects inflation to resume an upward path with “once-off” 2024 downward price movers, such as school fees, heading up again.
The IMF has been one of the key lenders in providing financial assistance to the country.
To manage different types of crises and foster medium-to longer-term development, PNG often relies on external financing from a number of international organizations, including the IMF, World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
With weaker institutional capacities and low-income levels, developing countries like PNG and other South Pacific countries are more vulnerable to external shocks such as geopolitical events, climate change, and rising debt burdens.
BSP supports the role the IMF has played in the stabilization of PNG’s economy and its programs providing financial and technical support and policy advice tailored to PNG.
The release of the 4th review funding will be welcomed, flowing through to provinces, districts and broader economy.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

PNG SEZ Policy set for launch,09/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4801,"The PNG Special Economic Zone Foundation Policy (2025-2032) will be launched at the end of this week in Port Moresby.
The Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, confirmed that the Prime Minister, James Marape, will officially launch the Policy on Sunday, June 15th.
Minister Maru said SEZ's policy follows after the passing of the SEZs Act of 2019. He said usually the policy was supposed to be formulated first, before passing the legislation. But Minister Maru stated that the SEZs Act wasn’t framed along a policy framework.
“There are many loopholes in the policy legislation, because the policy did not cover many of the areas that are critical in the legislation.
“I am happy to inform the country that the Marape-Rosso-led government will now deliver the foundation for SEZ,” said Minister Maru.
“I thank all the sponsors of the inaugural PNG SEZ Summit that was hosted in 2023, and all the departments, agencies, and everyone who cooperated in providing input to this important foundation policy.”
He said this is the time that PNG will have a foundation SEZ policy.
The launch of this policy will result in the current SEZ Act of 2019 being repealed, and a new Act will be enacted to reflect the changes in the foundation policy,” said Minister Maru.
This is an important policy. Provinces, districts and businesses who wish to be involved in SEZs need to get a copy of the policy to know the processes on how to establish SEZs and apply for SEZ licenses,” Minister Maru said.
Minister Maru said at this stage, PNG was set to establish up to seven new SEZs this year, apart from the Paga Hill SEZ that has already been licensed.
The Government has recently approved three SEZs, including the Sea Park SEZ, Finschhafen Integrated SEZ and the Central Province Industrial Park.
“We are expecting to announce a few more over the next month. This is an exciting year for our country with more interest coming from investors from within the country and outside the country to establish their businesses within the SEZs,” said Minister Maru.
“If a country like the Philippines, which is one-third our size, can have over 420 SEZs driving their economic growth at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, generating over US$63 billion in export income, and creating over 4 million jobs, we can do it too.”
Maru added that the SEZs will be the key driver of sustainable long-term economic growth in the country.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Puma Energy Reopens Madang Retail Site,07/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4770,"After nearly seven months of closure, the Madang town retail fuel site has officially reopened, bringing relief to vehicle owners, commuters, and transport operators who rely heavily on fuel access in the area.
The reopening marks a significant milestone for Puma Energy PNG, in partnership with Victory No. 8 Ltd, as they reaffirm their commitment to energizing the heart of Madang town and supporting the broader community, including those traveling along the critical Highlands Highway.

This development also underscores Puma Energy’s strategy of strengthening partnerships with local businesses and communities to drive regional economic activity and resilience.

Filipino firm eyes major investments in PNG,07/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4767,"The management team from a Filipino multi-billion-kina company, Century Peak Holdings Limited Corporation, visited Papua New Guinea (PNG) this week to assess major investment opportunities in the country. Their specific interest is to start a 10,000 hectares rice farm, invest in property within the Paga Hill Special Economic Zone, also expressing interest to invest in manufacturing and the mining sector as they own and operate a Nickel Mine in the Philippines.
The Company has five subsidiaries namely, Century Peak Corporation, Century Peak Mineral Development Corporation, Century Peak Cement Manufacturing Corporation, Century Sidewide Smelting Incorporated, and Century Hua Guang Smelting Incorporated. They plan to expand their operations to PNG. They have established a country office in PNG and have registered their company and are now looking at establishing a major business operation in PNG.
They called in on the Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, on Friday 6 June, and also met with the Managing Director for the Mineral Resources Authority, Jerry Garry as they are keen to know the investment opportunities available in the mining industry.
The company is about to secure 10,000 hectares at Brown River in the Central Province to start the first large-scale mechanized commercial rice farm in PNG. They have been working with the landowners and the Department of Lands and Physical Planning over 12 months.
“They are ready to start but the biggest holdup has been the slowness of the Department of Lands and Physical Planning in assisting the landowners to get the State title over their land so they can arrange a long-term lease and enter into a mutually benefiting project agreement with the State, the Central Provincial Government and the landowners. I have reached out to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Lands and Physical Planning, Hon. John Rosso, to help us resolve the land issue so we can start the first large-scale commercial mechanized rice farm in PNG before September 16. This project will be developed as the Central Rice Special Economic Zone,” said Minister Maru.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
K92 Mine reports more high-grade discovery,07/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4766,"K92 Mining Limited (K92), has reported that new high-grade results have been recorded from its surface and underground drilling programs at Kora, Kora South, Judd and Judd South deposits, as well as the Kora and Judd Deeps targets.
The mine in a statement reported that drilling at the K2 Vein has significantly extended a previously interpreted narrow zone into a broad high-grade dilatant zone, located approximately 100 metres from current underground infrastructure, further expanding the potential for bulk mining near-term.
These dilatant zones represent opportunities for bulk mining close to the twin incline and are expected to support near-term production as part of the Stage 3 Expansion.
Key intercepts from the expanded zone include 12.80 metres at 31.89 g/t gold equivalent (“AuEq”) (25.97 g/t gold, 58 g/t silver and 3.35% copper) and 10.10 metres at 16.29 g/t AuEq (14.01 g/t gold, 82 g/t silver and 0.84% copper).
Drilling has also continued to successfully extend high-grade zones up-dip from the main mining areas at Kora and Judd. At the K2 Vein, intersections of 7.17 metres at 39.50 g/t AuEq (37.93 g/t gold, 69 g/t silver and 0.50% copper) and 4.00 metres at 43.89 g/t AuEq (39.23 g/t gold, 72 g/t silver and 2.44% copper) were recorded.
At the K1 Vein, high-grade extensions included 4.08 metres at 30.95 g/t AuEq (30.29 g/t gold, 30 g/t silver and 0.21% copper) and 2.80 metres at 28.67 g/t AuEq (27.91 g/t gold, 18 g/t silver and 0.36% copper).
In the Judd J1 Vein, strong mineralization was intercepted both above and below the main mine. Above the main mine, results included 6.10 metres at 20.03 g/t AuEq (19.02 g/t gold, 7 g/t silver and 0.59% copper), and below the main mine, 2.20 metres at 16.13 g/t AuEq (10.00 g/t gold, 109 g/t silver and 3.11% copper) was returned.
Notably, a new high-grade copper zone has been delineated to the south at the K2 Vein over a vertical extent of over 300 metres.
Drilling has recorded several broad and high-grade copper intersections, including 10.05 metres at 12.25 g/t gold equivalent, consisting of 0.97 g/t gold, 84 g/t silver and 6.58% copper; 21.86 metres at 8.56 g/t gold equivalent, with 4.05 g/t gold, 41 g/t silver and 2.58% copper; and 11.70 metres at 15.85 g/t gold equivalent, containing 7.43 g/t gold, 162 g/t silver and 4.17% copper.
In the K1 Vein, to the south of the current resource, high-grade copper mineralization was also recorded, highlighted by 26.15 metres at 20.22 g/t AuEq, including 7.32 g/t gold, 165 g/t silver and 7.01% copper.
John Lewins, Chief Executive Officer of K92 Mining, commented: “The latest drilling results at Kora and Judd further reinforce the substantial potential for high-grade resource growth at Kainantu. At Kora’s K2 Vein, drilling has significantly expanded the previously interpreted dilatant zone up-dip, returning broad, high-grade intercepts in areas previously interpreted as narrow vein. Importantly, this dilatant zone is located near mine infrastructure, offering meaningful near-term bulk mining potential to support the Stage 3 Expansion ramp- up. Drilling has also continued to extend high-grade mineralization in multiple areas, with many intersections recording grades well above the 2023 mineral resource estimate at the K1, K2 and J1 veins, in addition to defining a potential new high-grade zone at K1 to the north. At K2, to the south towards the A1 Porphyry, a significant high-grade copper zone with a vertical extent of over 300 metres has also been delineated – plans are in place to continue to expand this zone at higher drill density. Regionally, our program continues to ramp-up, with plans to have five rigs operating at Arakompa in the coming weeks. We are also expanding our drill fleet further, with two additional surface drill rigs on order. We look forward to providing further updates in due course.”","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Stop & Shop’s roots trace back to 1987 when the first supermarket opened at Garden City, Boroko — alongside PNG’s first City Pharmacy — under the Steamships Trading Company. This joint opening marked the beginning of the CPL Group journey, led by Founder and current chairman, Sir Mahesh Patel.
In 2005, CPL Group diversified its operations by acquiring the Stop & Shop brand, taking over stores at Downtown, Boroko, North Waigani, and the original Waigani Central. The retail chain has since grown to include locations in Koki, Badili, Harbour City, and Airways Express.

Steamships is a dedicated and long-serving company in PNG and is deeply focused on a training and localization plan, with a structured and deliberate commitment to equip, empower and promote Papua New Guineans across all levels of the organization.  The National Training Council’s 3YTEP is a strategic initiative designed to align with the National Training Policy 2022–2032, aiming to enhance human resource development in Papua New Guinea.
By establishing a framework for employers to submit their training and employment plans, the Council seeks to identify and address the specific training needs of the workforce.
The commitment to maintaining the confidentiality of workforce and training data ensures that individual companies can provide accurate information without privacy concerns.
This aggregated data will play a crucial role in highlighting training gaps across both private and public sectors, enabling targeted interventions by training providers to meet local demands.
Moreover, access to this consolidated data empowers the National Training Council on behalf of the Department and Ministry of Labour and Employment to deliver informed and strategic advice to the Government regarding policy decisions that impact training and employment initiatives.
It is anticipated that the insights gained from the 3YTEP, would be utilized by the Council to advocate for relevant policies that support skill development and workforce readiness, ultimately contributing to the economic growth of Papua New Guinea.
Steamships Managing Director, Chris Daniells stated that as part of this commitment, Steamships has rolled out a combination of technical, behavioural, and leadership programs that have been designed specifically to empower exceptional employees who have shown leadership qualities.
These include: John Swire and Sons Leadership Philosophy, which emphasizes growing leaders from within, building character alongside competence, and creating a culture of responsibility, resilience, and long-term thinking.  National Training Council Director, Kinsella Geoffrey commended Steamships in addressing the role of PNG government through NTC, with efforts made by Steamships in training and developing the workforce, noting that many individuals who have received training over the years have successfully transitioned into the economy.
This acknowledgment is part of a broader government agenda aimed at enhancing training and employment opportunities for the youth and the general public, particularly in response to criticism regarding job creation.  “It is recognized that both the government and private sector play crucial roles in this endeavour, and there is a need for better communication of their achievements to stakeholders and the general public.
“The introduction of a three-year training and employment plan will serve as a benchmark to measure Steamships' performance, ensuring that progress is reported to the Department and Ministry of Labour and Employment,” said Geoffrey.  Various internal programs, such as the graduate development and leadership programs, have been acknowledged for their positive impact.
Additionally, the establishment of a Learning Resource Centre and a Maritime College is anticipated to enhance training prospects for both new entrants and those seeking refresher courses.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Morobe coffee exported to Dubai,01/06/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4686,"Morobe Province has exported its first-ever international export of premium green bean coffee, which sets the stage for future exports.
In a coordinated effort, over 121 bags weighing 7.3 tonnes were prepped for Dubai.
Prime Minister James Marape has hailed the inaugural air shipment of Morobe-grown coffee to Dubai as a “monumental breakthrough” for Papua New Guinea’s agricultural exports, marking a powerful step forward in unlocking the full economic potential of rural communities and affirming the Government’s commitment to commercialising agriculture.
Speaking in Port Moresby on the occasion of the official export departure, Prime Minister Marape praised the milestone as a gift to the nation during its 50th year of independence.
“Today, we are not just sending coffee to the world — we are sending a message: Papua New Guinea is ready to compete in global markets with the best of what our people grow,” Prime Minister Marape said.
“This airfreight shipment of premium Morobe coffee to Dubai is not merely a trade transaction. It is a symbol of our farmers’ resilience, our land’s richness, and our government’s ambition to transform agriculture into a powerful engine of economic growth.”
The shipment, spearheaded by local agribusiness AFIA PNG, included an initial 30 bags of specialty Morobe coffee, with a further 91 bags prepared for subsequent deliveries. The consignment was flown directly from Port Moresby to Dubai, showcasing PNG’s growing capacity to meet international demand through airfreight logistics.
“This is history in motion,” the Prime Minister said.
“We commend AFIA PNG and the Morobe Provincial Government for their visionary leadership. This is what it means to take back PNG — by empowering our people, our products, and our provinces.”
Prime Minister Marape said the Government’s focus under the National Agriculture Sector Plan (NASP 2024–2033) is to support exactly such models of innovation and export-led growth. He reaffirmed his government’s intent to replicate the AFIA approach across all agricultural regions.
“What AFIA PNG has achieved must not remain an isolated success,” Prime Minister Marape stressed.
He said the government will work to expand this model to other provinces.
“We want to see vanilla in East Sepik, cocoa in East New Britain, oil palm in Oro, rice in Central, and fisheries in Manus and Milne Bay reach global markets with the same success.
The Prime Minister said the shipment also sends a powerful signal to international buyers and investors about the quality, ethics, and distinctiveness of Papua New Guinea’s agricultural products.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Government Keen to Create Attractive Business Environment,29/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4654,"Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru says the National Government is committed to creating a more attractive business environment by investing in ease of doing business interventions.
Minister Maru made this statement during his keynote address to members of the Government Agencies and the private sector who gathered in Lae, Morobe Province, for the 8th Customs Business Consultative Forum under the theme, “Customs Delivering on its Commitment to Efficiency, Security and Prosperity,” hosted by the PNG Customs Service.
Minister Maru acknowledged that PNG is not an attractive place to do business right now compared to other countries.
“I want to thank all our Government Agencies and our private sector for hanging in there despite all the challenges that we are facing as a country including highest unemployment, highest law-and-order problems, serious foreign currency issues, national debt of over K60 billion, and depreciating Kina value which have made it very difficult especially for our private sector. Our biggest problem in the last 50 years has been this: We have failed to build a strong and robust economy like other countries. After 50 years, PNG’s GDP sits at about US$ 30 billion.”
But not all is doom and gloom. Minister Maru stated, “Because we have seven new resource projects coming up including Papua LNG, Pasca Gas, P’nyang Gas Project, Wafi-Golpu Mine, Frieda Mine, Wildebeest and Namabarope. These resource projects will underpin the economy going forward. To create the 1 million jobs as stipulated in our Medium-Term Development Plan 4, we must change our policies, we must downstream process all our resources, we must compete with the rest of the world to bring in foreign direct investments, and the best way to do it is to develop Special Economic Zones (SEZs) as the main driver of future economy growth. SEZs will be very critical.”
Minister Maru added, “Our over reliance on the mining and petroleum sector has been our biggest mistake since Independence. While we have seven resource projects in the pipeline for the next ten years, this sector will not be our future. Our future will be downstream processing of all our logs and fisheries resources, manufacturing of all our raw materials in country, and replacing imports like rice. This is the future.”
Minister Maru also informed the participants on the review of tariffs and the need to protect the manufacturing sector, and the need to bring in a new anti-dumping legislation to protect the industries from dumping of products from other countries.
“The Government remains committed to fostering a sustainable and diversified economy by reducing dependence on foreign aid, strengthening trade partnerships to create a more competitive business environment, and making PNG an attractive destination for global investors. We are looking at building new trade and investment partnership with Indonesia, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates, and also deepen and strengthen our trade and investment relationship with China and Japan on the back of a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement,” said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru extended an invitation to all participants at the forum to attend the upcoming launch of the PNG SEZ Foundation Policy on June 16, 2025, and the 2nd PNG SEZ Summit that will be hosted at the Hilton Hotel in Port Moresby from August 31 – September 3, 2025.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Kimbe Port Contract provides opportunities,28/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4637,"The Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Ewen McDonald has assured that the land side development of Kimbe Port under the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP) will create employment and provide skills development opportunities for both West New Britain and Papua New Guinea as a whole.
H.E. McDonald affirmed during the signing of the contract MoU by the PNG Ports Corporation with the Land side contract project contractor, the Global Construction Ltd yesterday which will be commencing in the coming weeks.
“It is fitting that in the 50th year of PNG Independence transformational infrastructure ports and upgrades will be well underway. Upgrade in Kimbe will be built to last another 50 years of more, supporting the long-term prosperity of the nation and more but I see it also having an impact across the region as well,” he said.
In supporting the gesture by the Australian government, H.E McDonald said using projects to provide opportunities for national industry should be a goal for all development partners in Papua New Guinea.
“As we being the Australian government are very proud to have been involved in the delivery of the new Kimbe market, and the benefits it’s providing as we heard, but also the 2.3 Mega Watt solar generation for Kimbe as well and I expect that to provide reliable power to the local households and business and I think it is again an excellent partnership between us,” he added.
Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea added that the Kimbe Port is the first of the five to be upgrade under a approximately PGK1.6 billion for the AIFFP.
Also present at the signing was Governor Sasindran Muthuvel, who said developing the port to international standards is going to improve business and give employment opportunities to his people and will bring much needed development to the province.
The Kimbe land side project includes pavement reconstruction, drainage repairs, line marking, utility upgrades and installation of firefighting and terminal lighting systems. Building works cover the refurbishment of key facilities including the port office, passenger terminal (kiosk and restrooms), stevedores’ amenities and the cargo shed.
“For the people of West New Britain, Kimbe Port is a critical social and economic asset – connecting West New Britain to the rest of Papua New Guinea and the world. Australia understands the importance of the province to PNG’s economy,” said McDonald said.
Both Global Construction and Pacific Marine Group are committed to using local labour that will deliver the works using a 70 per cent local workforce. Overall, the project will create over 300 local jobs in construction.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

The aircraft is planned for delivery to Port Moresby in September coinciding with Papua New Guinea’s 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations.
Air Niugini will be the 25th airline to operate the state of the art A220, with over 900 of these latest technology jets having been ordered by 24 other airlines around the world, of which over 400 are already in operation.

The A220s will initially replace the airline’s long serving Fokker 100/70 fleet on domestic routes, and eventually the Boeing 737s as well. Whilst the initial focus is to upgrade domestic services, the A220 is also capable of servicing all Air Niugini international destinations as well as some potential new routes which the airline is studying.
All the A220 aircraft will be fitted with comfortable Business and Economy seating, and will offer complimentary WiFi for all customers so they can stream their favorite programs and keep in touch with family, friends and work while they are travelling.
Air Niugini engineers, cabin crew and pilots have commenced intensive training, with the airline progressing through a comprehensive entry into service program to be ready to welcome the new aircraft during the first week of September.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Japanese Mining Company Express Interest to Invest in PNG,24/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4582,"The General Manager of Overseas Mineral Resources Business Department of Nittetsu Mining Co. Limited, Shinichiro Mita, met with the Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, in Tokyo this morning where he expressed interest to invest in Papua New Guinea (PNG), especially in the mid-size copper and limestone operation.
Nittetsu Mining is a Japanese mining company that specializes in both metallic and non-metallic mineral resources, and they are involved in mining, exploration, processing, and distribution of minerals, including limestone, copper, and other related products. They also have a copper mine in Chile. Additionally, they engage in machinery development, environmental engineering, real estate, and renewable energy projects.  They have been a long-term importer of copper concentrate from Ok Tedi Mine.
Minister Maru thanked them for their strong interest to invest in PNG and extended an invitation for them to attend the 2nd PNG Special Economic Zone Summit in Port Moresby which will be hosted from August 31st to September 3rd, 2025.
“I will link them with the Mineral Resources Authority and Kumul Minerals Holdings Limited so they can work with them to pursue their interest to be a mid-sized copper and limestone mining company in PNG. We are looking for more Japanese investors to invest in PNG and we will go all out to support them,” said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru also met with the representatives from the Sumitomo Forestry Co. Limited who own and operate the Open Bay Timber Limited in East New Britain Province where they have 10,000 hectares of eucalyptus plantation.
The minister encouraged them to seriously look at downstream processing instead of harvesting and exporting round logs to markets in Vietnam and China from where PNG then imports the finished products from.
“We have a clear Government Policy for PNG to stop exporting round logs by 2025,” said Minister Maru.
The company admitted that because of the decision by the Indonesian Government to ban the export of round logs, they now have a major downstream processing plant in their operations in Java where they are processing all the logs from their forest plantations in Indonesia. They will be happy to do the same in PNG. However, the issues that they have are electricity and road access to the Open Bay.
“I will discuss these issues with the Minister for Forests and the Managing Director for PNG Forest Authority, John Mosoro, on my return to PNG. This is a very low-hanging fruit as far as going into downstream processing is concerned,” said Minister Maru.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Prime Minister James Marape congratulated Kina Bank, expressing his honour to be present for the unveiling of the 40th anniversary logo. He acknowledged the bank's transformation over the past 40 years, its contributions to the livelihoods of Papua New Guineans, and its impact on the banking landscape in the country.

Minister Maru Impressed with the Efforts of the Team at the World Expo,24/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4580,"The Expo Site in Osaka, Japan, is crowded with visitors every day from 9am to 9pm with one-third being foreigners and two-thirds from Japan, reported the Commissioner-General of Section Papua New Guinea (PNG), Ambassador Gabriel Dusava during the visit of the Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, to the Expo Site this week.
Ambassador Dusava and the officials on the ground have reported that they’ve been receiving many enquiries from Japanese tourists who are overwhelmed by the beauty, scenery and the culture of PNG.
“They wish to visit PNG. However, their biggest concern is no direct flights between Japan and PNG and no visa on-arrival for Japanese standard passport holders. There had also been business enquiries. Our biggest wish is to have Air Niugini re-open the direct flight between Port Moresby and Narita before our National Day on July 22. The program for the National Day is being finalized where the Prime Minister,  James Marape, will be the Guest of Honor and the Head of Delegation,” said Ambassador Dusava.
The program will include the Prime Minister attending the National Day in Osaka on July 22, then traveling to Tokyo in July 23 to meet with potential investors who want to invest in PNG.

Misima landowners oppose mine acquisition,23/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4576,"The Landowners and affected communities of Misima Island this week announced their unequivocal opposition to the extension of the expired tenement term over the Misima Mines and are rejecting any attempts by third parties—whether private or state-owned—to claim rights or interests over their ancestral lands.
In a statement released 20 May, 2025, Member for Samarai-Murua Isi Henry Leonard stated, “We refer to the Media Release by Ok Tedi Mining Limited dated 20 May 2025 regarding its attempt to acquire Misima Gold and Silver Mine and we condemn in the strongest terms Kingston Resources’ last-ditch attempt to cash in its interests in the Misima Mine after deliberately misleading our people into believing it would develop the project. This betrayal exposes Kingston’s bad faith—and confirms what we have long suspected: they never intended to honour their commitments. This is not merely corporate negligence; it is a calculated deception. Kingston exploited our community’s hope, wasted our time, and now seeks to walk away without consequence. We will not allow it!”
The MP explained that Kingston Resources Exploration License EL1747 has expired, leading him to question, “Why is Ok Tedi Mining Limited and Kumul Minerals Holdings Limited spending AUD$60million of public funds to buy an Expired Mining License instead of spending public funds in honouring Legacy Issues of Misima Mine and work with the Misima Islanders and their mining company to apply for a new Exploration License?”
In highlighting what the statement describes as a ‘legacy of broken promises and suffering,’ the MP said, “For over 20 years, successive tenement holders, including Kingston Resources and the PNG Government, have failed to address the unresolved legacy issues left by the Misima Mine, which operated from 1989 to 2004 under Placer Dome. The mine extracted 3.8 million ounces of gold, which is worth over US$12Billion at current world market price, yet the people of Misima have been abandoned with no tangible benefits.
The benefits promised by the national government and the mining company were never delivered. Critical infrastructure, including health facilities, roads, airports, wharves, electricity and water supplies have deteriorated, and the island’s socio-economic conditions have regressed to pre-mining levels.”
Thus, the landowners are declaring that they will not give consent to the transfer of tenement or extension through three points:
1.	No Consent: They will not permit the extension of the expired tenement or the transfer of rights to any new operator without their free, prior, and informed consent.
2.	Breach of Trust: Past developers and the PNG Government have repeatedly violated agreements, including failing to address environmental damage (e.g., cyanide spills and submarine tailings disposal) and neglecting post-closure rehabilitation.
3.	Self-Determination: Misima Islanders have, through their District Development Authority, established their own district mining company and insist on the right to develop their resources with partners of their choice.
The landowners are also making four main demands:
1.	Immediate halt to all negotiations for tenement extensions or transfers.
2.	PNG Government accountability for its historical failures, including the lack of a closure plan and unresolved socio-economic impacts.
3.	The PNG Government to come up with solutions to hold the Misima Mine developers accountable for catastrophic environmental damage—including the destruction of freshwater streams, arable land gardens and fishing grounds—and the profound social impacts on the Misima people
4.	Recognition of Misima Islanders’ rights to manage their resources, aligning with the lessons from failed top-down mining models.
MP Leonard stated further that the people of Misima will no longer be exploited.
“The remnants of the Misima Mine will stand as a solemn reminder to the future generations of Misima that there was once a mine on their island—a mine that stripped their land of its riches and left them with little, if anything, to show for it. But these remnants have also served as a reminder to all Misima Islanders that we cannot stand aside as spectators in negotiations or decision regarding the reopening of the Misima Mine.
“The People of Misima have a responsibility and duty to the future generations of Misima Island to chart our own path towards true economic freedom and self-determined development.”","Business, Anger",Business,Anger
Plastic bottle recycling in Lae launched,23/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4571,"Lae residents now have the opportunity to keep their environment clean and earn money at the same time.
Instead of recklessly throwing empty polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, plastic bottles away, residents can take them to Branis Recycling Ltd’s premises at Limki, Speedway, for recycling.
You will earn K1 for every kilo of empty plastic drink bottles (not just Coca-Cola products) that are returned to either Branis Recycling at Limki or Karimata St, along Aircorps Road, where the Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (PNG) Limited head office is.
Speaking at the launch of the Lae PET collection program on Wednesday, May 21st, CCEP PNG commercial director, Tim Solly, said this is an expansion of the PET collection and recycling scheme that was launched in Port Moresby in May 2023.
“We’re a proud manufacturer here in PNG and with that comes responsibility,” stated Solly. “And we know that we are responsible to find solutions for the bottles that we produce that ultimately go back to the environment. Because the last thing we want, is to see those bottles in the environment and in the beautiful, pristine waterways of Papua New Guinea.”
The PET granulator, sometimes referred to as a ‘crusher’, will cut the plastic bottles into small pieces or PET flakes, which will then be sent offshore for further recycling.
Solly said from the over 600 tonnes of PET waste in Port Moresby, they have so far collected 26 percent of it.
Coca-Cola ASEAN South Pacific senior director sustainability, Dr Casper Durandt, said for the first time this year, the collection done in PNG will be included in the Coca-Cola Company’s sustainability report.
“So, the report will come out hopefully in the next month or so and hopefully, we will see and I mentioned, no promises made but we will do our best,” he stated.
“This project in Lae is evidence of a sustained effort. Important point to make is that, this project cannot work if value is not added to the project by obligated industries. Coca-Cola is obligated; it has a good business and it’s putting in effort and money and resources behind this project.
“It’s like pushing the wheelbarrow up the hill. If we don’t push it, it will not go up the hill.
“PET bottles do not collect themselves. They are not like aluminium. Their in-use value is too low for organic, natural recycling rate and we saw the evidence of that.”","Environment, Joy",Environment,Joy
Local company diversifies operation,23/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4567,"Over the last 10 years, a Papua New Guinean coffee export company has diversified its operations, adding cocoa and roasted coffee on its list of products.
Wia Trade is owned by Dr. Joel Waramboi, a food scientist who, 10 years ago, decided to put his research to work in a new business.
He started a plastic manufacturing company in 2014 but had to sell off that part of the business after the government legislated against plastic bags.
He then decided to venture into the coffee business, where he began training coffee farmers in the Erap region, in Morobe’s Nawaeb district, from 2016-2019.
From there, the food scientist was able to expand his activities through the Coffee Industry Corporation, where he built a coffee mill at Nadzab, to provide a market for coffee farmers. The company then invested in a coffee roastery factory equipped with state-of-the-art machinery.
“We opened this factory on 16th May, 2024,” said Dr Waramboi. “From this factory here, we produced the Erap Coffee that now you see out in the market. It comes out from this facility here.
“We’ve done some products that are now out at Anderson’s Eriku, Foodmart supermarket, and we are looking at expanding to other centres, especially the Port Moresby market.
“This is high quality product; naturally and organically grown. No fertilisers. Grown in the high altitudes of Erap. Foothills of the famous Saruwaged Range. That’s where this coffee comes from.
“We don’t mix this coffee with any coffee that comes from Kabwum or Wantoat or wherever. Only Erap. That’s how we maintain the purity of this product.”
It has been a year since the opening of the Wia Trade roastery. And so far, K22,000 has been generated by the new facility.
Wia Trade has also expanded its portfolio to include instant coffee and bottled water.
“Because people are talking about instant coffee and 3-in-1,” he continued. “It costs almost K100 million every year to bring soluble coffee products into the country. This data is from PNG Customs in Port Moresby.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

This ‘life after mine’ strategy was initiated with a K1 million investment in 2022 by MRDC through the PNGLNG Pipeline Limited board. The collaboration between the Omati Cocoa Project in Kikori, Gulf Province, MRDC, and its subsidiary Gas Resources Pipeline Limited (GRPL), serves as the nucleus of this agricultural program.
The Omati nursery, initially stocked with 1,000 select cocoa seeds from proven genetic lines from East New Britain, has evolved into a significant propagation center. It currently maintains a capacity of 50,000 seedlings, with plans for expansion to 100,000.
“MRDC's investment in the Omati Cocoa Project and its expansion to Gobe reflects our community investment commitment to our project communities.
""We understand that sustainable economic development must look beyond resource extraction. By fostering agricultural enterprises, centered on high-value crops like cocoa, we are helping communities with the tools and resources for self-sufficiency and building a resilient future,” said Augustine Mano, Managing Director of MRDC.
""Approximately 500 farmers are now actively engaged in cocoa cultivation in Kikori, each receiving quality seedlings and support. The positive response and the evident success have fueled demand, leading to this expansion to Gobe. We anticipate further interest as communities witness the benefits of high-quality cocoa farming, said Wauro Oumabe, PNGLNG Pipeline Ltd Director for Segment Seven in Kikori.
""My primary objective as a leader is to steer our communities towards sustainable agricultural development as a primary economic driver. This cocoa project is a practical and promising pathway for our landowning communities,” Chairman of Petroleum Resources Gobe (PRG), Matthew Sisimolu said.
Chairman Sisimolu invested K6,000 towards the acquisition and distribution logistics of the initial 2,000 seedlings for Gobe. These seedlings are being distributed across several communities in Gobe Oil Project area, including Kaiam 1 and 2, Kaiam Ferry, Done, Siawiti, Waterfront, Baina, and Kantobo, targeting areas with suitable agricultural potential.
Kila Oumabe, who plays an active role in farmer mobilisation and training in Omati, particularly for women, stressed the economic transition.
""Revenue from resource projects has a lifespan. Cocoa, however, is a perennial crop; it offers a sustainable income stream that can support families year after year.
""Access to consistent income from cash crops like cocoa directly impacts household food security and the ability to invest in education and health. For many women and marginalized households, who may have limited access to benefits from larger resource projects, cultivating their own cocoa plots offers a direct pathway to improved livelihoods. The initial nursery establishment saw a significant contribution from local women, who recognised the long-term potential of cocoa.""
Oumabe added that reliable income is essential for covering school fees, healthcare, and other basic necessities.
Future for the cocoa initiative focuses on strengthening the entire agricultural value chain. ""A comprehensive five-year development plan has been submitted to MRDC,"" Mr. Wauro Oumabe noted.
""A key feature of this plan is the proposed establishment of a processing facility. We aim to empower communities to move up the value chain from merely selling raw beans to producing processed cocoa, thereby retaining more value locally.
“Such a facility would not only improve post-harvest handling and quality control but also create new employment opportunities, skills development in processing and grading, and open avenues for niche marketing of regionally branded cocoa products. This aligns with broader national goals of increasing domestic value-addition in the agricultural sector.” Wauro said.
In 2024, the Cocoa Board of PNG certified the project, affirming its adherence to national quality standards and best practices.
Ongoing technical collaboration with the Department of Agriculture and Livestock further provides farmers with access to essential agronomic expertise and extension services, ensuring the adoption of optimal cultivation techniques.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
Coffee seedlings distribution program launched,22/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4557,"Minister for Coffee, William Bando, has officially launched the Coffee seedling distribution program for Southern Highlands Province in Mendi.
This initiative aims to boost coffee production in the province by providing farmers with high-quality seedlings.
During the launch, Bando emphasized the importance of coffee as a key agricultural product for the province and its potential to enhance livelihoods and drive economic growth.
The event attracted local farmers, stakeholders, and members of the community, all eager to participate in the program.
Bando encouraged farmers to take advantage of the seedlings to improve their yields and contribute to the sustainability of the coffee sector.
The distribution program is expected to positively impact local agriculture, promote self-sufficiency, and strengthen the overall coffee industry in Southern Highlands Province.
Meantime, Provincial Member for Southern Highlands Province William Powi urges the local community to embrace coffee farming as a sustainable livelihood.
“Stop following the politicians around and start holding the land and grow coffee,” Governor Powi said. “Politicians have no money. Plant coffee and coffee will look after you and your children.”
Powi stressed that the coffee seedling distribution will also support farmers with access to coffee seedlings to boost local coffee production.
This initiative aims to transform the agricultural landscape of Southern Highlands by fostering entrepreneurship and reducing dependency on external aid, ultimately improving the socio-economic conditions of the people in the province.","Agriculture, Anticipation",Agriculture,Anticipation
PNG Proposes Economic Partnership Deal,22/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4546,"The Government of Papua New Guinea is keen to anchor its trade and relationship with Japan through a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) into the future.
Minister of International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, conveyed this through Japan’s Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry, Koga Yuichiro, during their first formal meeting on Tuesday in Tokyo, Japan.
Minister Maru, on behalf of the PNG Government, thanked the Japanese Government and people for 50 years of friendship which had evolved to one of the most important and enduring bilateral diplomatic and trade relationships.
“Our country has benefited immensely from Japan through scholarships and development aid through organizations like the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).
“The most recent examples are the Tomodachi International Airport at Nadzab in Lae, Morobe Province, and three weeks ago, JBIC announced a loan of K1.8 billion US Dollars to bankroll the funding of the Papua LNG Project. During our disasters, Japan has always been one of the first countries to come to our aid. I want to express to your Government and your country our gratitude for such an enduring, warm, and lasting relationship that has evolved over the last 50 years,” said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru alluded that Japan was PNG’s biggest export market, comparable only to China.
“We truly appreciate that trade is in our favour. At the moment, Japan is importing an estimated US$4 billion from PNG, and it only exports about US$250 million to PNG annually. Trade is very much in PNG’s favour, but there is a lot more scope and potential for investment and more trade flows between our two countries.
“There are opportunities for cooperation where both sides can benefit if we strengthen the relationship and anchor it through a proper agreement, which we have not had in the last 50 years. It's time to reset our relationship and anchor our future on the back of CEPA between our two countries. This should be the new chapter after 50 years of our relationship, anchored on trade and investment as the foundation,” said Minister Maru.
Minister Yuichiro acknowledged the proposal by Minister Maru; however, he said both countries needed to deal with fundamental trade issues.
He also requested PNG to provide the framework for the proposed CEPA if PNG was serious to go down this path.
Minister Maru said the PNG Government will take note of Minister Yuichiro’s comments and will work on the framework for the proposed CEPA as a matter of priority so the negotiations can start this year.
Minister Maru further expressed his gratitude for the Japanese investment in the LNG sector and encouraged Japan to take a more active interest in investing in PNG LNG projects","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Morobe’s elementary school teachers upskilled,21/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4539,"Over 80 elementary school teachers in Morobe Province are undergoing a one-year training to attain a diploma in early childhood and junior primary teaching.
After their orientation on Friday, May 16th, director of PNG Education Institute, Dr Zui Neofa, explained that this is the second batch outside of the Morobe Early Childhood Teachers College campus at Heldsbach, in Finschhafen district.
Last year, 160 students completed their elementary teacher qualification upgrade training, while the second batch of 82 students started their training on May 12, 2025, with the rest expected to join soon, bringing the number to 100.
“They have been trained in the elementary system,” clarified Dr Neofa. “They are qualified teachers. We just need to make sure we upskill them and we give them training under the new curriculum that has come into place.
“We are confident they will be teaching in the primary sector, under the new structure (1-6-6).
“They are mostly Grade 12 school leavers (who) have been elementary teachers.”
Dr Neofa alluded to the crucial need to upskill elementary teachers following the education reform, and the use of the Standard-Based Curriculum (SBC) with the 1-6-6 structure.
The one-year residential diploma program was made possible through a partnership initiated by former Morobe Governor, Ginson Saonu, in 2021, with the Education Department and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of PNG.
Dr Neofa explained that they had to relocate the training location to Wampar because moving lecturers to and from Finschhafen was risky and costly, while they were using church facilities that the church might otherwise need for its own programs.
Furthermore, law and order in the district has escalated, prompting the decision to move students and staff to Wampar.
Dr Neofa outlined that PNGEI is looking for a standalone campus for the elementary teacher qualification upgrade training.","Education, Trust",Education,Trust
Brewing prosperity,21/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4537,"As the country experiences high levels of economic performance, farmers in PNG are cashing in on record prices for coffee and cocoa, helping to boost Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
This is according to ANZ Research’s International Pacific Economist, Dr Kishti Sen. The research report shows a GDP to grow by 4.7 per cent in 2025, this was said to be one of the best years of economic activity over the past decade, driven largely by PNG’s exports of coffee, cocoa and palm oil, as well as gold.
“The national income derived from its coffee and cocoa exports has helped to almost wipe out some of PNG’s foreign currency issues, which have been a persistent headwind to the economy since 2014.”
“Historically, high rural commodity prices have been a remarkable boost for the PNG economy. It’s a win-win situation – stimulating the economy while providing much-needed liquidity in the foreign currency market,” said ANZ Economist Dr Kishti Sen.
In 2025, bean prices at the New York Coffee Exchange are fetching USD$2.80/LB, a 153 per cent increase compared to the historic average of USD$1.50lb. This is a 62 per cent increase from the average price in 2024. Cocoa crop shortages in the growing regions of West Africa are also keeping cocoa prices elevated.
“Coffee exports from PNG this year are expected to reach a million bags, which is a level not seen since 2016,” he said.
Coffee prices are forecast to generate PGK2,000m in export receipts, something the country has never achieved before.
It is projected that high cocoa prices will generate cocoa receipts in excess of PGK1,500m in 2025, compared to an average of PGK300M in the decade to 2024.
The manufacturing and transport industry sectors are also playing a part in PNG’s economic story, employing a growing number of local workers. Greater spending power from rural households will see more demand for container imports of consumer goods. The wholesale and retail trade industry can expect to have a strong year too, with output expected to exceed the 6.8% achieved in 2022 when coffee prices last escalated.
“PNG’s economy is performing stronger than our initial expectations and is set to record solid GDP growth this year. Green shoots in business investment reinforce that view.
“ANZ Research is confident that stronger growth can resume from 2026, as several major projects in resource and infrastructure commence. Once underway, this strong growth is expected to be sustained into the 2030s.”","Economy, Joy",Economy,Joy
Hatavile Coffee Ltd receives export license,20/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4529,"Locally-owned Hatavile Coffee Ltd (HCL) in Wantrifu village, Daulo District of Eastern Highlands, will now be able to export its quality coffee after receiving its coffee export license from Coffee Industry Corporation (CIC).
CIC-PACD project manager, Potaisa Hombunaka and CICL Senior Coffee Inspector, Frank Waipi, were delighted to present the license to HCL general manager, Philip Timbie, on Thursday, May 15, 2025.
This comes after years of hard work and assistance from the CIC Productive Partnerships in Agriculture Project (CIC-PPAP) and now PACD, CICL, his community, coffee suppliers, family, and Korean business partner, BJ Choi.
“When we started doing coffee work, we were selling green beans locally from our 50-hectare coffee plantation here at Hatavile, but I wanted to go an extra mile, so we worked hard to improve production and most importantly, quality,” said Timbie.
The support to rehabilitate his coffee factory and plantation was not easy. A lot of sacrifice, dedication and resources had to be put in to bring it to what it is today- to be granted an export license as a national is a milestone achievement for Timbie and his Wantrifu community.
World Bank Senior Agriculture Specialist and PACD Task Team Leader, Allan Oliver, who was present to witness the license presentation, said such stories brought hope and showed that with the right support from the industry and development partners, it was pleasing to see a community such as Wantrifu receive its export license.
“If you can do it, I think we can do it in any community in PNG. With the right support, the right infrastructure, the right people in the industry to support you, and if it is the industry’s vision to grow the coffee industry, then it is possible. I am very proud to witness you and your partner’s achievement today. For the bank, it is a success story. It is a good story to tell,” Oliver said.
Hombunaka, said, “We can export coffee from Hatavile! We do not need to be in towns and cities to export coffee. At PACD, a good number of them are coming up and will export coffee soon,” he said.
Hombunaka highlighted the reality of coffee exports among local companies and established multinational companies.
He revealed that 90 percent of exporters are Papua New Guineans and 10 per cent multinational companies, however, 10 per cent of multinational companies export 80 per cent of coffee, while 90 per cent of Papua New Guineans export little at 20 per cent.
“We must change that landscape, and change has started, and within 10 years, there will be more Papua New Guinean exporters exporting. Coffee exporting is not rocket science. It can be exported from rural settings and not only in towns. The growers need to benefit more from the industry. It belongs to the growers, the resource owners.”
CICL Senior Coffee Inspector Frank Waipi said Timbie started as a grower with his 50 Ha coffee plantation. He was building his coffee warehouse when I started inspections at his setup.
“During my initial inspections, I submitted a full report to my supervisor. However, the license application was rejected. I told him that he should not give up but to persevere.”
Over the course of five years, HCL did not stop. It kept on working hard and finally ticked all the boxes. Waipi said the requirements involved investing in coffee production, having a warehouse, processing mill, and the last is to go into third-party exporting to learn the pros and cons of exporting. He acknowledged Kofi Management Services Ltd for being the conduit for HCL.
Timbie acknowledged the hard work of his wife and children, who have been silently supporting him behind the scenes throughout the years.
“I have been just a frontliner to direct the traffic of coffee flow, but you have been my support since the start of this journey.”
He also thanked his boys at the factory house, all his coffee supply chain partners; Takus Irantiweb, David Skairara, Stallon at Henganofi and Meme Wakikura at Okapa and his friends from Maprik, Kimbe, Rabaul, Finschhafen and Popondetta for supplying good quality coffee.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
Livestock policy review underway,20/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4513,"Officers from the Livestock Development Corporation and the Department of Agriculture are in Lae City to host the consultative review on the proposed National Livestock Policy.
Following a successful consultative forum in Goroka last week, for the Highlands Region, the government’s livestock specialists on policy matters arrived in Lae yesterday for the review, set for today (May 20) at the Lae International Hotel.
Provincial representatives, including private sector representatives and institutional experts from the University of Technology and the National Agriculture Research Institute, will share their insights at the meeting.
Livestock Development Corporation managing director, Terry Koim, outlined that a policy is fundamental in addressing many livestock challenges. This is to align strategies that encompass the Government’s vision through the National Agriculture Sector Plan and the Medium Term Development Plan IV.
“The livestock industry has been operating within a policy vacuum for many years,” outlined Koim.
“While credit is given to the private sector for keeping the industry alive, the Government must step up to improve industry conditions that will allow Papua New Guineans, especially smallholder farmers, to get direct benefits.
“A policy will clearly define the functions of the Livestock Development Corporation and allow it to regulate the industry for the better.”
The consultation is to get feedback from stakeholders in the private, public sectors and smallholder farmers, to find workable policies to guide and improve the industry.
The National Livestock Policy aims to ensure that livestock as a resource is developed and managed sustainably for economic growth and improved human livelihoods.
The LDC says the overall objective of the National Livestock Policy is to develop a competitive and more efficient livestock industry that contributes to the improvement and well-being of various livestock chain actors.
The draft policy covers five pillars, which are;
•	Livestock species and products
•	Livestock production (upstream)
•	Consolidation/aggregation (midstream), processing (downstream)
•	Industry Services, and
•	Cross-cutting, cross-sectoral issues and policies
The consultative meeting is open to all stakeholders.
New Guinea Islands and Southern region consultations will be held in June.
A validation workshop will then follow before the draft is submitted to the National Executive Council for endorsement.
The policy will form the basis for the formulation of the Livestock Industry Bill as directed by Prime Minister James Marape in 2020.","Agriculture, Anticipation",Agriculture,Anticipation

Downstream processing of coconuts imminent,17/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4482,"The management team of a Sri Lankan large-scale coconut-based food and beverages manufacturer/exporter, on Tuesday 13 May, met with the Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, to express their keen interest to set up a coconut processing plant in Madang Province under a Joint Venture arrangement with the local investors.
Joindi Export Pvt Limited has two processing plants in Sri Lanka under the brand name ‘econutrena.’ They have a diversified product portfolio using the coconut. Their clients include supermarket, food companies, hotels, and the cosmetic industry in Europe, North America, Japan, Australian, Germany, Netherland. Their products are stated to be 100 percent organic and are certified under different local and international certifications including USDA Organic, Fairtrade, ISO 22000, Control Union Certifications, Business Social Compliance Initiative.
Minister Maru, said, “Our Government together with the Madang Provincial Government are very keen to work in partnership with the Joindi Export and Kokonas Indastri Koporesen (KIK) to develop the proposed processing plant in Madang that would have the capacity to process up to 100,000 coconuts per day to produce high-end coconut products.
This is a long overdue initiative and I am so delighted that they are keen to start this project. We have been waiting for partners to help us to go into downstream processing of our coconuts to produce high-end products for the global market.”
“Coconut industry is one of the industries in our country that has been around for a long time, but we have been semi-processing and that is one thing that our country and our Government does not want anymore. We do not need to export coconut oil anymore.
We want to process our coconuts into final products to maximize our value, create more jobs, and encourage the industry to grow if our people can see a better value.
“Joindi Export's already have big clients in Australia including Woolworths and it is cheaper to supply Australia from PNG rather than from Sri Lanka.”
Maru further stated, “The biggest thing is, we must offer a good price to the farmers for the coconuts so they will be attracted to supply the nuts to the processing plant. This is critical. The products manufactured in the proposed plant must also carry the 'PNG Made' logo so the world will know that these coconut products are from PNG.”
Minister Maru encouraged the investor to provide him with a full investment proposal outlining the capacity, production, equity, and the financial and operational viability of the project.
“We look forward to receiving Joindi Export's full investment proposal next week,” said Maru.
Minister Maru confirmed that equity will not be an issue.
“I will also work very closely with the Madang Provincial Government to secure 10 hectares of land in Madang for this very important investment that will transform the coconut industry in PNG,” said Minister Maru.
“I want to thank the Managing Director of KIK, Mr. Alan Aku for arranging this important investment mission for this company to meet with me and other key stakeholders,” added Minister Maru.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Upgraded water system planned for Rabaul,16/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4469,"Water PNG Ltd has decommissioned a reservoir tank that has faithfully served the residents of Rabaul town and Malaguna 1 for the past three decades.
Speaking on Thursday, May 15th, 2025, during the official decommissioning in East New Britain Province, Business Centre Manager, Emos Michael, said the decision was made to pave the way for the construction of a new and improved reservoir.
Michael outlined that the current Red Light Reservoir Tank site in Rabaul town, which has been a crucial part of the local water infrastructure, has provided clean and reliable water to the community for many years. However, with the increasing demands on the water supply system and the need for modernisation, Water PNG Ltd has deemed it necessary to upgrade the facility.
Emos said demolition work by Madang-based contractor, Fimali Ltd, commenced on Wednesday, May 14, and once completed, work on the replacement tank will start.
During this time, operations will continue with direct pumping into the main and distribution system.
He said the team will be working with Rabaul Urban LLG Environmental Health section to ensure safety disposal of the tank. Furthermore, local youths will be engaged in the fencing project so they take ownership of the project.
Meantime, team leader production, Mohu Moana, said the current tank is 720 kiloliters, but it will be upgraded by 220 kiloliters. They hope this will address water issues currently experienced by residents and business houses in Rabaul town.
Moana appealed to authorities and people in Rabaul to look after the new tank. He said after the new tank is established, fencing facilities will also be upgraded.
Fimali Ltd spokesperson, Benbert Toa, said the timeframe of work will take 6 to 8 weeks before normal water operations resume.
Water PNG Ltd has assured residents that measures will be put in place to minimise disruptions to the water supply during the decommissioning and construction process.
The company has also promised to keep the community informed about the progress of the project and any developments related to the new reservoir.","Infrastructure, Anticipation",Infrastructure,Anticipation
ENB launches ambitious cocoa initiative,14/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4437,"The East New Britain Provincial Government has launched a major initiative to distribute approximately 1 million cocoa hybrids and clones this year, as part of the cocoa rehabilitation program.
This large-scale effort is being carried out in partnership with PNG Cocoa Board and Agmark Group Limited.
As part of the rollout, payments for the initial 700,000 cocoa seedlings – covering the districts of Pomio, Rabaul and Gazelle – have been made to PNG Cocoa Board and Agmark Group Ltd.
The PNG Cocoa Board received K350,000 to support seedling distribution, while Agmark Group was granted K282,622 to supply equipment for nurseries and cocoa fermentaries.
Payments for the remaining 300,000 seedlings for Kokopo district are currently being finalised under similar distribution arrangements.

ENB aims to maintain copra title,12/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4390,"While other cash crop industries in the country are still discussing downstream processing of raw materials, the coconut sector is already selling its byproducts in shops and markets.
This progress includes a homegrown product that ensures money comes back into the pockets of farmers, their families and host communities, thus creating a conducive environment for economic spinoffs.
All this advancement has been made possible through the responsible government agency for the coconut industry, the Kokonas Indastri Koporesen (KIK).
A delegate from KIK was in East New Britain Province last week with partners to witness the launch of a nursery at Tabuna Ward, in the Bitapaka local level government of Kokopo district.
Having a capacity of 10,000 seedlings, the nursery is part of a tripartite program delivered by the KIK through its business arm, Coconut Resources Limited (CRL), and partners like the South Pacific Community (SPC).
Provincial advisor for the Division of Agriculture and Livestock Industry (DALI) under the ENB Provincial Administration, Dominic Huranaka, applauded the program, which also captures youths through backyard sports and white copra production.
White copra is a term that refers to the high-quality form of copra produced through careful drying methods.
“Bitapaka LLG is the highest white copra producer in the province with farmers already in the alert (direct payment) system. So, thank you KIK, CRL and SPC for supporting our program in the province,” he stated.
Huranaka said it is a great initiative that should be progressed into more wards in the province under the partnership between the provincial government, KIK and SPC.
KIK coconut development officer, Elizabeth Melchior, said this nursery aims to replace the aging senile trees while progressing white copra production.
“This concept is homegrown, and I commend the head of CRL, Ephraim Tade, for creating an avenue where markets and finance will find farmers on their farms. The concept is inclusive as it captures people with disability,” she stated.
The alert payment system has been running for three months and will be reviewed with all partners going forward.
KIK acting general manager of the Industry Services Division, Douglas Maip, said ENB is a leading producer of copra and has the second largest number of coconut trees in the 14 coconut growing provinces in the country.
“According to the 2023 coconut census, PNG has over 16 million coconut trees; 2.5 million of which are in East New Britain Province. While ENB is the leading coconut producer in the country, it is estimated that 50 percent of its 2.5 million trees are senile with low productivity.”
The program, through the nurseries, aims to replace aging trees with quality seedlings, which in turn should improve productivity and secure the next 30 years of coconut production in the province.
“We encourage farmers to plant 50 palms in your yard, as it can produce up to 20-30 litres of Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) in a month or a hundred kilogram of white copra,” he said.
The nurseries are also in line with the government’s target of planting over 100,000 nuts in ENB to reach the national target of 1 million nuts across the country annually.
There have also been 12 small to medium enterprises (SME) established in the production of VCO and body oil and soap respectively in Kokopo district.
In terms of the potential of the province, Maip said in the last four years alone, East New Britain has produced over 108,000 metric tons of copra, which generated K217 million in revenue.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy

Digicel Cell Moni partners local firm to provide digital financial access,10/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4366,"Digicel PNG, the leading telecommunications service provider in Papua New Guinea makes another bold step to fostering financial inclusion in rural PNG, through a new arrangement between Digicel CellMoni and Kamapim Ltd.
This strategic arrangement promises to bring digital financial and payment services to thousands of unbanked Papua New Guineans, particularly women and smallholder farmers who lack access to formal financial services.
It will further enable rural producers, many of whom lack identity documents and live far away from banking infrastructures the access to traditional financial services including; sending and receiving money and making secure payments via Digicel CellMoni’s mobile money service.
This innovative approach supports Kamapim Ltd’s mission to build transparent, regenerative, and equitable value chains, starting with the Vanilla sector.
“Most women in the rural areas are excluded from the economy because they lack formal IDs and access to financial services,” said Nancy Irwin, Managing Director of Kamapim Ltd.
“By integrating Digicel CellMoni’s digital wallet system with our traceable sourcing platform, we can offer farmers, especially women a safe, fast, and transparent way to be paid and empower them to be economic contributors.”
Through this partnership, farmers supplying vanilla and other high-value crops to Kamapim Ltd will be issued digital economic identities, allowing them to register their Digicel CellMoni wallet and receive mobile payments, build a digital financial history, and gain access to savings and other financial services such as paying of school fees or superannuation.
This is particularly transformative in remote areas where formal banking is inaccessible or non-existent. “At Digicel Cellmoni, we are proud to partner with Kamapim Ltd to drive real change in communities that need it most,” said Thompson Sakyi, Managing Director at Digicel Cellmoni PNG.
“We believe digital inclusion is a pathway to economic empowerment, especially for farmers and women in rural PNG and we are more than happy to facilitate this through our strategic alliance with Kamapim Ltd.”
The pilot phase will be launched in Afore LLG, Oro Province and Boiga District, Madang Province with plans to scale across Kamapim’s wider farming network of 21,000+ smallholders by 2026.
The integration will also support supply chain traceability, climate-smart agriculture, and gender-inclusive practices aligned with national and donor priorities for inclusive rural transformation.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
MRDC Outlines Plans to Reinvest in Western Province,08/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4339,"The Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC) has announced its commitment to invest more in the province.
MRDC managing director and chief executive officer, Augustine Mano said investments will be made in sectors that can give a better return.
He made the commitment while speaking during the opening of the second CMCA review working committee discussions held at the Hilton Hotel in Port Moresby that ended on Wednesday. MRDC looks after project benefits for the beneficiaries that come from the Ok Tedi Mining project held in trust by its three subsidiaries, Mineral Resources Ok Tedi 2 (MROT2), Mineral Resources Star Mountain (MRSM) and CMCA Holdings Limited.
“We will invest back into the province, in the sectors that can give a better return,” Mr Mano said. “We are dedicated to diligent investment management and remain highly confident in the continued growth and value of the assets entrusted to us.
“We will ensure the expansion of local investment within Western Province to create tangible benefits on the ground.”
The five-day CMCA review was hosted by Ok Tedi Mining Limited and was attended by all stakeholders including MRDC as the landowner trustee company. MRDC has maintained a strong and active presence throughout the CMCA review process.
Last year, MRDC senior management team actively attended the review sessions held in Daru, Kiunga, and Tabubil, underscoring the significance of this process.
Mr Mano also highlighted the importance of having a coordinating agency to channel funds to beneficiaries. He said if consolidated, there would be quite a lot of money going into the province for infrastructure alone.
“If you look at the funds that are going to Western Province on infrastructure alone, and if you consolidate them, that's a lot of money.
“If you put OTML’s tax credit scheme, the SSGs (Special Support Grants), royalty, PNGSDP and the DDA funds, you put all of them under one basket, you're dealing with the same people.
“All we need is a coordinating agency to channel these funds to the beneficiaries and then develop and move on. “That is one area in this forum to address. There's an agency to coordinate so it goes to all the beneficiaries in the province. So, once you have the infrastructure, then you can expect investment to come, employment to be created, and you can see changes.”","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
BSP Flags US Tariff Risks on Pacific,08/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4338,"Bank South Pacific (BSP) has warned that the new U.S. tariffs on Pacific nations could create wider economic risks for the region, even though the direct impact on Papua New Guinea (PNG) is limited.
BSP Group CEO Mark Robinson said while PNG’s exports to the U.S.—mainly coffee, cocoa, and vanilla—are modest, the 10% blanket tariff and even higher rates for nations like Fiji (32%) and Vanuatu (23%) threaten to disrupt trade flows.
He cautioned that such disruptions could have meaningful consequences for Pacific markets where BSP operates.
“The real risk lies in indirect effects on our major regional partners like Australia and China, who face significant tariff exposure,” Robinson said, noting Palau and Niue’s exemption and a 90-day grace period offered to others.
BSP, operating across seven Pacific countries, sees stability in these markets as vital to economic resilience.","Business, Fear",Business,Fear
Morobe launches key projects,08/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4334,"The Morobe Provincial Government launched a number of ambitious projects at Watarais, Markham district, on Tuesday, May 6th.
Among the eight projects launched were ICT tower and E-library, Morobe solar power system and a proposed Watarais Regional Growth Centre, or township, that will service the highways of Lae, Madang and Highlands.
Deputy Provincial Administrator – Infrastructure, Kissu Lucas, outlined that K2 million has been allocated to conduct surveys before 20 ICT towers are built across the province.
“We are implementing eight projects which have been initiated by the governor,” said Lucas. “First one on the list is the ICT tower. We are trying to construct 20 towers throughout the province, unlike Digicel who built it themselves. We will build it for the telecommunication companies. They can use the towers to hang their services up.”
The 20 towers, estimated to cost between K20 and K30 million in total, will be constructed in partnership with the National Information and Communication Technology Authority (NICTA) Universal Access and Service (UAS) Fund.
The provincial government has allocated K2 million in this year’s budget to commence surveys in the districts of Markham, Nawaeb, Finschhafen, Bulolo, Tewai-Siassi, Menyamya, Wau-Waria and Huon Gulf.
The other project is K92 mine royalties recognition for Watarais landowners, a solar power project, a Watarais Regional Growth Centre, a cocoa downstream processing facility, proposed PNG University of Technology lectures on food technology and cattle range development projects.
The proposed Watarais growth centre will serve as a township housing a commercial hub as well, located at the junction between the Madang and Highlands highways. This project, however, is subject to clan vetting and registration of an Incorporated Land Group, with Lucas saying the provincial government will assist with the processes.
Currently, different groups are claiming ownership of the area where the growth centre is going to be built on.
All the projects are also subject to funding availability and approval by the respective district development authorities.","Development, Anticipation",Development,Anticipation
ICCC announces May fuel prices,08/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4331,"The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) has announced the approved maximum retail fuel prices for this month, which will take effect on Thursday, 8th of May 2025.
For this month, the Indicative Retail Prices (IRPs) for petrol, diesel and kerosene will all decrease on average nationwide, consistent with the movements in the international crude oil prices.
This month's decrease has indicated a significant drop in domestic fuel prices for three consecutive months, offering great relief to consumers at the pump. It has also been noted that the international fuel prices have generally decreased over the past 12 months.
The decrease in average crude oil prices in April 2025 was mainly attributed to increased supply by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies and decreased demand due to the trade war between the United States of America (USA) and all its trading partners during that month.
The domestic retail fuel prices (IRPs) for this month are inclusive of the Import Parity Prices (IPPs) or the imported costs for each petroleum product, domestic sea and road freight rates for the second quarter of 2025, the approved annual wholesale and retail margins for 2025 and the Goods and Services Tax, including the applicable excise duties, among other parameters.
In Port Moresby, as a result of adding all the various cost components mentioned above, the maximum retail price movements for petrol, diesel, and kerosene in Port Moresby will change as follows:
•	Petrol: K4.17 (price was K4.29 in April)
•	Diesel: K3.88 (price was K4.01 in April)
•	Kerosene: K3.60 (price was K3.72 in April)
Meanwhile, ICCC states that retail prices in all other designated centers will change according to their quarterly approved domestic freight rates for the second quarter of 2025, and their respective annual retail margins for this year.
For all other centres, the maximum retail prices for each regulated petroleum product will change on average, consistent with the changes observed for Port Moresby.
ICCC officers will conduct inspections to all service stations to ensure prices of declared petroleum products comply with the allowable maximum prices.
The prices set by the ICCC are the indicative maximum retail prices, for which retailers may choose to sell below the ICCC-approved maximum price.
Whilst retailers may choose to set fuel prices on their pumps to one decimal place, the ICCC will continue to set the maximum price to 2 decimal places.
ICCC advises that no fuel pump operator should charge above the Indicative Retail Price for this month's price, regardless of the number of decimal places.
This is to ensure compliance with the Prices Regulation Act under which the maximum prices of declared petroleum products are set. Retailers who are displaying prices to 1 decimal place are urged by the ICCC to round the prices down to ensure prices are within the allowable indicative retail prices.
ICCC Inspectors will continue to conduct spot checks on 8th May 2025, to ensure ongoing compliance by retail fuel operators.","Economy, Joy",Economy,Joy
Austria Keen on Doing Business with PNG,07/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4326,"The new Austrian Ambassador, Elisabeth Koegler, today met with the Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, to express Austria’s keen interest to do business with Papua New Guinea.
Ambassador Koegler said Austria’s area of interest in investing in PNG was in downstream processing of forestry, solar, hi-tech industries and hydro, which they are considered a leader in, provided their mountainous terrain and abundant water resources, which have made it a significant producer of hydroelectric power.
Austria is a landlocked country in Central Europe with a population of over 9 million. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with a nominal per capita GDP of over US$40,000 (2018 est.) and the country has developed a high standard of living, ranking18th in the world on the Human Development Index in 2019.
Austria boasts a highly developed, export-oriented economy with strong industrial, service, and tourism sectors. The country benefits from its strategic location at the heart of Europe, serving as a key trade and logistics hub between Western and Eastern Europe.
With a well-educated workforce and high levels of innovation, Austria is home to strong industrial firms in machinery, automotive parts, and pharmaceuticals, while Vienna serves as a financial center for the region.
In terms of trade between Austria and PNG, in 2023, PNG exported US$6.3 million to Austria with the main export products being processed fish, pulley systems and lifting machinery, whilst Austria exported US$1.66 million to PNG with the main products being other printed materials, interchangeable tool parts, and other heating machinery.
Minister Maru expressed his interest to work with the Ambassador Koegler and the Austrian Embassy to have more Austrian investors to come and invest in PNG.
“We want more investments in the hydro and green energy space, manufacturing, and downstream processing of forestry and building,” said Minister Maru.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

K92 Completes Stage 3 Expansion,06/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4288,"K92 Mining Limited, the operator of the Kainantu Gold Mine in Eastern Highlands Province has achieved another major construction milestone in its operations with the announcement of the successful installation of the SAG and Ball mill circuits at its Kainantu Mine.
This is the third stage of K92’s expansion program and the new mills will process 1.2 million tonnes of ore per annum.
The Ball Mill installation was officially completed on April 19th and the SAG Mill installation was completed on April 23rd.
Following this significant milestone, K92 Mining remains on track to begin commissioning the Stage 3 Plant Expansion this quarter and hand over to operations in the fourth quarter, setting the stage for the transformation of K92 into a Tier 1 mid-tier producer.
K92 mine in a statement said its construction activities are progressing well, seeing approximately 75% of the growth capital either spent or committed as at March 31, 2025.
K92 expects to be an even larger contributor to the growth and economic prosperity of Papua New Guinea and the local communities with the completion of these expansions.
Key highlights over the life of the mine include the creation of an extra 500 plus jobs during the expansion phase, investment of K1.4 billion capital into the country in 2024 and 2025, increase in exploration expenditure to 120 million kina by 2026, increase in production numbers and increased spending on local expenditure among others.
In it’s inaugural CARES awards last week, K92 CEO, John Lewins highlighted the performance of this mine in 2024.
“A mine that in 2024:
•	Produced almost 150,000 ozs of gold
•	Paid almost PGK170 million in corporate tax (second highest in the industry)
•	Paid PGK51 million in Payroll Tax
•	Paid PGK34 million in royalties
•	Spent over PGK600 million in Capital
•	Spent PGK370 million in local expenditure
•	Spent PGK12 million on Community Benefits Program
•	Spent PGK108 million on Community JV Companies
•	Spent PGK63 million on exploration and was the largest explorer in PNG
•	Employed almost 2,000 people, 93% of whom are from PNG
“It is a mine that this year will spend PGK800 million in capital to transform Kainantu into a World Class Gold Mine capable of producing 300,000 ozs of gold per annum and on the way to increasing production to over 400,000 ozs per annum. At the same time, we expect to pay in excess of PGK200 million in Corporate Tax in 2025 (having already paid PGK70 million in April) and significantly increase our spending in all of the areas I listed for 2024.

Cannery MOU to be signed this Friday,06/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4284,"After 50 years of sovereignty, Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, says Papua New Guinea will soon have a partly state-owned cannery.
“This new cannery will be developed under a new joint venture (JV) company which will be 50 per cent owned by the State and 50 per cent by RD, with initial expertise to be provided by RD to help us transition from being a rent collector to being an owner of initially a cannery and later a fishing company,” said Minister Maru.
RD Group chairman, Roy Rivera, and his management team arrived from their Headquarters in the Philippines for the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between RD, the State and Kumul Consolidated Holdings Limited (KCHL) for the development of the state-of-the-art cannery with a processing capacity of 300-metric tons per day in Madang province.
Minister Maru said, “This will be the first time that PNG will own a cannery. It is estimated that the construction of the cannery itself will cost K160 million. This will be jointly funded by RD and the KCHL who will hold the shares on behalf of State. Each party will provide K80 million each. The new cannery will be owned and operated by a new fishing company which will be called.
“Kumul Fisheries Limited” is under a joint venture between RD and the KCHL. Kumul Fisheries Limited will have its own brand and will market its products globally under the new brand. The Board of this new company will have members from both PNG and RD. The management will initially be from RD, but over the next five years, all the positions will be localized.”
It is planned that after the signing of the MOU on Friday and the endorsement of the design of the new cannery, a new Shareholder Agreement will be signed between the State and RD for the construction to start immediately.
“The tender documents for the construction of the new cannery will be ready after the signing of the MOU. The construction will take up to 18 months. About 500 people will be employed during the construction phase and over 5,000 will be employed once the cannery is completed and is in operation,” said Minister Maru.
He further stated that the immediate task of the new cannery is to assist the country to replace all canned fish imports by producing enough canned fish in our cannery to supply the local market.
“Although PNG catches between 600-700 metric tons of fish every year, 80 per cent leaves the country to be processed offshore because we do not have processing facilities. As a result, PNG is still importing canned fish from all over the world. It is ridiculous that we export 35,000 tons of canned tuna and import 40,000 tons, and we are losing up to 100,000 jobs and over K4 billion in revenue by not processing all our fish in PNG.
“We are waiting for the National Fisheries Authority to come up with the new Domestication Policy so over the next five years we will process 100 per cent of our catch in PNG.”
“The building of this new cannery in Madang is the start of a deliberate attempt by our Government to invest in downstream processing so we can replace all canned fish imports from other countries. This cannery is the anchor investment needed for the proposed Madang Integrated Special Economic Zone (SEZ). This is a very exciting development, and we all look forward to the signing of the MOU next Friday,” added Minister Maru.
Chairman Rivera said, “I am emotional and excited for this project. My late father built the first cannery in Madang 29 years ago, and as his son who succeeded him as the chairman of the RD Group, I now have the privilege to build the second cannery, but this time in partnership with the PNG Government.""
Madang governor Ramsey Pariwa, has also been very supportive and excited about this project. He said, We, the people of Madang, have waited so long for the PMIZ project to eventuate. It is finally happening after 15 years of waiting. I thank RD Group for being willing to partner in this new cannery venture in Madang.”
Meanwhile, the Department of International Trade and Investment will be putting out a notice this week for Expression of Interest from the private sector to build a new international wharf and also power and water supply, and sewerage in the proposed Madang Integrated SEZ under a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer model.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
PNG Tuna Industry Targets Growth,05/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4277,"Papua New Guinea recently marked World Tuna Day on May 2, with renewed ambition to reclaim greater control over its valuable tuna industry and drive sustainable economic growth.
As the country approaches its 50th Independence Anniversary, Prime Minister James Marape and the National Fisheries Authority (NFA) are leading reforms to ensure more benefits stay onshore.
Under the theme ""Yes We Can,"" the NFA, led by Managing Director Justin Ilakini, is advancing the National Tuna Domestication Strategy (NTDS) and a revised Tuna Fishery Management Plan.
The strategy aims to process 50 per cent of the tuna caught in PNG waters domestically, creating jobs, boosting local investment, and enhancing national revenue.
Globally, tuna accounts for 20 per cent of all marine capture fisheries, and for PNG, it sustains thousands of livelihoods. However, much of the industry's value chain has been offshore, dominated by foreign fleets.
""These reforms will change the game,"" said Ilakini, who emphasised the need to shift from exporting raw resources to building local capacity.
With these policy shifts, PNG is poised to strengthen its role in the global tuna market, contribute to the Marape-Rosso Government’s vision of a K200 billion economy by 2030, and secure a sustainable, prosperous future for its people.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
ENB creates project implementation unit,02/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4234,"The East New Britain Provincial Government (ENBPG) has established a Provincial Project Implementation Management Unit (ENBP-PIMU).
The unit will serve as the implementing agent for the provincial government and its administration, and will be located within the Provincial Division of Transport and Infrastructure Development.
This decision was among three that were endorsed during a provincial assembly meeting, held on Thursday, April 24th, prior to the issue of writs for the 2025 Local Level Government elections.
This unit will be responsible for designing new roads, bridges, wharves, and institutional houses, as well as scoping works for civil and building projects.
It will also manage and supervise civil and building projects from the initial stages to completion.
Former chairman of the human resources management sector in the ENB Provincial Assembly, Robert Mati, said previously, the Gazelle Restoration Authority (GRA) was the implementing agent of the ENB Provincial Government.
Mati explained that the GRA Act has become obsolete, because the Authority has completed its mandate of restoring basic government services and infrastructure within the Gazelle Peninsula, following the 1994 volcanic disaster.
“In 2010, the ENBPG decided to retain GRA as its implementing agent, and between 2010 and 2021, GRA implemented over K41 million worth of projects,” he outlined.
Mati further noted that since 2021, there has been minimal implementation of major projects in the province, highlighting the need to establish a unit specifically tasked with the design, scoping, implementation, and supervision of government projects.
In 2024, the Provincial Executive Council (PEC) had agreed and endorsed the Special Projects Authority (SPA) as the implementing agent. However, that decision has now been revoked as it conflicts with the District Development Authority (DDA) Act.
Mati emphasised that the purpose of the PIMU is strictly to implement projects, while decisions and procurement responsibilities will remain with the respective DDAs and the provincial government headquarters, adhering to standard administrative and legislative requirements.
The PIMU will be staffed by five personnel: a project manager, two contract officers (civil and building), and two administration officers.
The unit will be fully funded by the ENBPG through its internal revenue, with an annual allocation of K500,000 to cover the wages of the five PIMU officers.
Project supervision and management across the province will be carried out by the PIMU, in collaboration with officers from the Division of Transport and Infrastructure Development (DoT&ID) and the respective districts.
Minister for Health and Pomio MP, Elias Kapavore, commended the establishment of the PIMU, saying it will significantly uplift the standard of project implementation in the province.
Kapavore said while many projects are being implemented, there has been a lack of proper management and supervision.
“I commend the provincial administration and the team for advancing these initiatives. This will enhance the alignment of projects so that we all achieve a common goal for our province,” he stated.","Government, Trust",Government,Trust

BSP Unveils Business Bank to empower SMEs,01/05/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4220,"BSP Financial Group Ltd officially launched its dedicated Business Bank on April 30, 2025, promising to transform the way Papua New Guinea’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) access banking services.
The new division offers tailored solutions to help local businesses grow, thrive, and lead — with a strong focus on reaching customers wherever they operate, from city offices to remote market stalls.
BSP Group CEO Mark Robinson called the launch ""a significant step forward"" in aligning the bank’s services with the realities of PNG businesses.
“We recognise that SMEs have different requirements, aspirations, and challenges. BSP Business Bank is designed for PNG and most importantly, designed for growth,"" Robinson said.
He highlighted that SMEs are the backbone of employment and economic development in PNG, and supporting them can create ripple effects in communities nationwide.
The Business Bank offers a full suite of products, including business loans, EFTPOS, foreign exchange, payroll services, and advanced online banking tools. More notably, BSP’s business bankers will travel across the country — from trade stores in rural areas to growing enterprises in urban centers — offering hands-on support.
Head of Business Bank, Raymond Logona, emphasised this on-the-ground approach: ""We’re out there — in markets, in offices, and in communities — walking alongside our clients to help them unlock opportunities.""
In partnership with the Asian Development Bank and Australian Business Volunteers, BSP will also roll out financial literacy workshops, equipping SMEs with practical skills in cash flow management, tax, and marketing — a move set to strengthen PNG’s business foundation for the long term.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
New megamall to be built in Hagen,29/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4186,"Steamships and Tininga Ltd recently broke ground on joint venture project, Dobel Central, a mixed-use megamall in Mt Hagen, Western Highlands Province.
The new, state-of the-art 10,000 square-metre development will play a critical role in driving progress across agriculture, MSMEs, tourism, and other key sectors in the Highlands region.
Dobel Central is a collaborative initiative aimed at creating an inclusive, thriving commercial hub that not only facilitates business growth but also directly empowers local communities through job creation and entrepreneurial opportunities.
“We see this not only as an investment in infrastructure but as an investment in people,” said Steamships Managing Director, Chris Daniells, in his address on Friday, April 25th.
“Our goal is to create a premium retail and commercial development in the Highlands; one that provides a safe and secure trading environment.
“It will be an inclusive space that nurtures opportunity—where entrepreneurs can flourish, youth can find employment, and families can benefit from improved access to services and amenities.”
Steamships highlighted the essential role of partnerships in this achievement, particularly with the Western Highlands Provincial Government, whose support has been instrumental in aligning the development with the region’s strategic goals.
Tininga Managing Director, Pat Duckworth, said: “Changes in government have brought about a positive shift in law and order, fostering a safer, more positive community. Tininga has its roots firmly implanted in Mt Hagen and together with Steamships, we believed in the potential of the Western Highlands.
“That belief started with the Hagen Central development in town and today we are proud to take the next step with Dobel Central.”
The capital investment of Dobel Central is worth an approximate K200 million and is expected to deliver expanded retail and commercial spaces, supporting a wide range of local and national businesses while reinforcing Mt. Hagen’s role as the premier service centre for the Highlands Region.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Maru proposes downstream processing of wood products,28/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4171,"The Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, has proposed to venture into downstream processing of wood products within a Special Economic Zone with the PNG Forest Authority (PNGFA).
His proposal comes after a special meeting with PNGFA Managing Director, John Mosoro and his senior officials.
Minister Maru was accompanied by Secretary Jacinta Manua, and his senior officials, where Mr Mosoro discussed solutions to implement the Government Policy relating to the phase-out of log export and promote downstream processing of all logs in the country under the current SEZ Policy.
Mr Mosoro provided an overview of the proposed operation of the PNGFA, and emphasised the need to fast track specific tasks relating to amendment of the Forestry Act, Total Forest Inventory of the forest resources in the country, reforestation and plantation programmes and downstream processing of all logs into wood products for export to international markets, based on best terms and conditions of pricing formula used in under EU markets and others.
He also expressed concerns regarding lack of financial lending to support the Government Policy on log export ban and downstream processing.
“We have written to the Treasurer on several occasions to fund downstream processing feasibility studies of log ponds or export zones but did not get the funding requested even though the costs are already being approved by NEC and also in our budget submission last year.
“I am concerned that if there is biased funding by the Treasurer then this policy on downstream processing will fail and that will be a major loss to revenue generation for this Government,” Mr Mosoro said.
PNGFA has also expressed interest in taking part in the Osaka World Expo 2025 in Japan to showcase to the world PNG’s rich and unique forest resource and attract investment.
The Osaka World Expo began on April 13th and will continue till October.
MD Mosoro and senior Forest Officers briefed Minister Maru and Secretary Manua of the progress of the PNGFA and its potential in attracting investors at the expo.
They stressed that the development of the forest resource is not just focused on logging but on downstream processing, and natural values of the resource, nature-based solutions.
“We are phasing out the export of round logs by the end of this year 2025 This is a government policy we need to implement.
“We are looking at nature-based solutions - putting a value on our Forest resource. Our trees, the leaves and bark have economic value. We have an arrangement with the United Kingdom, which is assisting us to put a value on forest resources,” Mosoro said.
He added, “PNG forests are rich and can capture and absorb carbon emissions instantly from industrial countries from any part of the world.”
Mosoro was supported by his corporate strategic planner Mark Pilon, who said investors globally are environmentally conscious.
“Logging and chopping of forests does not fall in the top 100 global activities anymore,” he said.
PNGFA’s Chief Operating Officer, Magdalene Maihua, added that downstream processing and tree plantations are the way forward. She said PNG FA plans to plant 800,000 trees by 2050 under its reafforestation program, but added that funding is an issue.
PNGFA’s Director of Economic and Trade and PNG Diwai Holdings, Verolyne Daugil said PNGDHL intends to market PNG’s forest Products to the international market and will look at investment opportunities during the expo.
“With the establishment of the PNG Diwai Holdings, there is an opportunity to partner with investors to acquire logs for downstream processing and export,” Daugil said.
She added that PNG Diwai Holdings is not receiving adequate funds committed by the government to support its operations and this is a challenge.
Ms Daugil said the high tax imposed by the government on log export of 50 percent is also a challenge to the industry, where almost 90 percent of operations have shut down.
“Forestry has a lot of potential and opportunities. At the end of the day, the environment for investment must be conducive,” Ms Daugil said.
Manager of Connect PNG projects in Forestry, Gabriel Gabonen, said existing Forest management projects have built a road at the rural, remote sites. He said PNGFA has partnered with the Works Department to link the road projects with the national Works Connect PNG program.
Minister Maru responded, commending PNGFA for supporting the establishment of PNG Diwai Holdings.
Mr Maru said he saw good potential in forestry and downstream processing and its contribution to the national economy.
He suggested that PNGFA and his department sign an MOU to partner in a SEZ, where tax and other incentives are in place to attract investors to do business.
“I am happy to sign the agreement with PNGFA and the Forest Minister and support the proposal in cabinet,” Minister Maru said.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Analysts say it's 'highly unlikely' Xi Jinping called Donald Trump over tariffs,27/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4165,"As the world watches tariff brinkmanship unfold between the US and China, analysts have cast doubt on the truth of US President Donald Trump's claim in a magazine interview that China's President Xi Jinping called him.
Mr Trump told Time magazine that tariff talks were taking place between the US and China, an assertion he repeated to reporters as he was leaving the White House to attend the funeral of Pope Francis in Rome.
Beijing denied any talks were taking place.
""China and the US are NOT having any consultation or negotiation on #tariffs,"" China shot back in a statement posted by the Chinese Embassy in Washington.
""The US should stop creating confusion.""
In response to Mr Trump's comments to Time, several China analysts told the ABC they did not think Mr Xi would have called his US counterpart.
King's College London business lecturer Xin Sun said it was ""highly unlikely"" Mr Xi called Mr Trump because to call him without invitation would imply Mr Xi would make concessions under pressure.
""For any political leader in China, this would have very serious consequences for their own political stability,"" Dr Sun said.
""It basically means that it signals weaknesses and vulnerability to possible political opponents.""
Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser on Chinese business and economics at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in the US, agreed with that assessment.
""I don't think the two have communicated directly with each other since they spoke on January 17,"" said Dr Kennedy, referring to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement that confirmed the pair spoke when Mr Trump was re-elected as US president.
""The US president recently has made several comments implying momentum in talks with China and others in order to reassure markets,"" he added.
""There may be low-level communications, but very unlikely to be ongoing negotiations.""
'A preventative move'
China responded to Mr Trump's imposition of 145 per cent import taxes by placing 125 per cent tariffs on American goods.
While there is little clarity on what if any deals and negotiations are underway between the two countries, there have been some signs of some de-escalation in recent days after China quietly exempted some US goods from the import levies.
Mr Trump has also imposed a raft of tariffs on other countries, which have been scrambling to come to agreements with the US.
In the Time magazine interview, Mr Trump also said the US had made 200 tariff deals and expected to have them signed off in three or four weeks.
""We're meeting with China. We're doing fine with everybody. But ultimately, I've made all the deals,""  he said.
However, Dr Sun pointed out that not a single major trading partner had confirmed such deals had been signed.
""Given those unsubstantiated claims Trump and his administration has made over the past few weeks, I think there is a strong political incentive for the Trump administration to make the claim that China is in negotiation with the US,"" he said.
""Doing so would probably constitute a preventative move in case Trump would need to make further retreats regarding tariffs on China.""
The Australian Strategic Policy Institute's Bethany Allen said Chinese authorities would be unlikely to deny a call took place between the two leaders if that was true.
""Trump is known for off-handed comments that may be somewhat less than precise,"" she said.
""Messaging on the Chinese side, however, is always extremely precise and controlled. I think it is possible that Trump may be referring to some kind of contact — perhaps substantive, perhaps not — between US and Chinese officials.""
On Saturday, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing stands on the side of international rules regarding US-imposed tariffs and opposes protectionism.
Mr Wang said Beijing would seek solidarity with other countries on the tariff situation and exposes ""extreme egoism"" and the bullying of certain countries, a veiled reference to the US.

Baiyer landowners encouraged to prepare for future gains,26/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4155,"Landowners of the Baiyer Cattle Ranch in Western Highlands Province  have been advised to immediately register a landowner company to maximize benefits once the cattle ranch comes into full operation.
Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) Managing Director, Terry Koim had an audience with a few landowners and settlers at Baiyer Police Station to outline LDC’s plans to revive the ranch.
“Landowners need to come together and register a company, so they become shareholders to any investment on the 4000 hectors of land.
“LDC is just a custodian of the land. We want to create generational wealth for the landowners whose land is where the Baiyer Cattle Ranch sits on,” said Koim.
Baiyer Cattle Ranch is in the Mul Baiyer electorate of Western Highlands Province.  It is a colonial property handed over to the Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) in 1982 when LDC was established.
Mismanagement and lack of good governance eventually ran the ranch down in 1992.
Today, a bulldozer is already on site with eviction notices already served to the settlers in late February this year.
“Like all other LDC properties throughout the country, we are taking back Baiyer Cattle Ranch.
“There is no need to discuss land title issues. The land belongs to LDC.
“The land was given to the Government for cattle grazing during the colonial time and then handed over to LDC in 1982, but LDC management at that time shattered the hopes of the landowners’ forefathers.
“That dream is now going to happen and LDC will make it happen,” Koim said.
With settlers moving out of the ranch, work has now commenced to build proper access roads in the valley. Fencing of the property should commence in May.
Mr Koim said by December 2025, cattle should be grazing on the once abandoned Baiyer River Cattle Ranch.
“I urge the people of Baiyer Valley to work with us and help us deliver this project in our collective interest for a better future. It's revitalization is aligned to the government's MTDP 4 2023 - 2027 policy under the National Livestock Development Program.
“This will create more economic empowerment for the people of Baiyer and their children and contribute towards the overall import replacement and food security policies of government.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Father-daughter duo graduate,25/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4142,"A father-daughter duo from Turubu LLG, in East Sepik Province, proudly walked to the stage to receive their respective certificates in irrigated rice farming on Thursday, April 24th, at Erap, in Morobe Province.
Linus Suwun and his eldest of five children, Michelle Suwun, paid for their own trainings, including their trip from Wewak to Lae, to make sure they were available for the Trukai Smart Farmer graduation.
They were part of the 160 rice farmers – under batch 3 and 4 – who received their certificate in irrigated rice farming.
These farmers – from the regions of Momase and Highlands – have completed 20 weeks of irrigated rice farming training; two weeks were spent at the PNG University of Technology campus in Lae, while another 18 weeks were on their respective farms.
The Suwun family, from Mandi village, started rice farming in 2018 to support themselves in the Turubu LLG of Wewak district. There are limited employment opportunities in Wewak; a scenario that resonates with the rest of the country.
Despite being located in the capital of East Sepik, Ward One of Turubu LLG has no electricity, no proper running water and an education and health system that leaves much to be desired for.
What they have in abundance though, is land. And that is what the Suwun family has been doing for decades; toiling their land.
The opportunity to get further training and possibly venture into commercial farming popped up in the form of an advertisement in the paper.
Linus, who is in his 60s, said the ad about the Trukai Smart Farmer program prompted him to fill in a registration form, and he encouraged his daughter to do the same. Their applications were accepted and they started their irrigated rice farming training in 2023.
“I met the cost of my registration fee, including the cost of traveling to Lae,” said Linus. “Registration was K220 while it cost me K600 to travel to Lae – from taking a boat in Wewak to Madang, then traveling by bus to Lae – to attend the training.
“My dad was a cattle farmer,” he continued. “We killed our last cattle in 2021. My dad and I had started the farm in 1973. From that time until 2021, we did not get any support so the last cow in our farm was killed off.”
Just like his father before him, Linus is always looking for options to take care of his family, and the fact that his daughter shares his passion in agriculture means the family has a greater chance to be self-sustaining.
“Trukai taught us how to grow rice in wetland,” shared Michelle. “You can be able to plant rice in swamplands.
“My dad instructed us to plant ‘Sepik Organic’ rice in 2018. We planted it directly on dry land. We were now taught to plant the ‘Trukai’ rice species in water. And also, with the Sepik Organic species, we planted its seedling in wetland then transplanted it. We have noted that it grows well in water, compared to direct planting on dry land.
“Even with Trukai, direct planting does not yield good results. But when it is transplanted, it produces a higher yield.
“During our training, they said we can get 30kg of rice from our 7-metre by 7-metre (7x7) plot. From that concept, we noted that direct planting was not satisfactory. We got below 25kg. But in transplanting, we yielded over 25kg.”
Under the Smart Farmer program, farmers are required to build a 7x7 plot as part of their knowledge transfer back home.
The father-daughter duo harvested their rice on April 8th, milled it, cooked it with protein and sold as lunch packs. The income from their food packs was added to their savings to ensure they could travel to Lae for their graduation on April 24th.
Michelle further said the irrigated rice farming technique has caught the attention of their community, and they have been kept busy, showing them how to plant their rice.
The Suwun family now needs a tractor to plough their land as they aim to expand into commercial rice farming.
“We hope an organisation or district government can help us with a rice farming kit so we can clear our area faster.”","Agriculture, Joy",Agriculture,Joy
Eco Group Questions Fisheries Funds,24/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4133,"Concerns have emerged from Milne Bay's Eco Custodian Advocates (ECA) following the launch of five multi-million kina fisheries facilities by the National Fisheries Authority (NFA) in Alotau.
While the projects aim to boost local economies, ECA Director David Mitchell has raised red flags over financial transparency and environmental sustainability.
Mitchell questioned the public funding handed to private enterprises during the launch, citing a lack of visible contractual agreements and reporting frameworks.
“Has there been any formal accountability set for how these funds are used?” he asked, adding that the sudden disbursement of large sums without clear oversight mechanisms is troubling.
He also raised concerns about the absence of stock assessments and environmental impact studies, especially for live reef fish and beche-de-mer operations. “We don’t know whether wild stocks can sustain this level of harvesting long-term,” Mitchell warned.
ECA is also wary about the sustainability of seaweed farming, pointing out its labor-intensive nature and minimal financial returns for small-scale farmers, despite a recent 33-tonne export.
The organization is calling for a review to ensure long-term ecological balance and value-for-money outcomes.","Environment, Fear",Environment,Fear
Fisheries Infrastructure Boost,24/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4132,"The National Fisheries Authority (NFA) has launched five new fisheries facilities in Milne Bay Province, enhancing local livelihoods and economic development.
Speaking during the commissioning in Alotau, NFA Managing Director Justin Ilakini emphasised the importance of empowering coastal communities and sustainably managing marine resources.
The new infrastructure includes the Flying Taihan Mountain Trading Live Fish and Frozen Fish Facility, the ASL Sand Fish Hatchery, the NFA Seaweed Facility and Office Complex, the Gunuwala Mud Crab and Frozen Fish Facility, and the Boboana Seaweed Export Facility.
Together, these projects are expected to directly employ over 300 people and create more than 20,000 indirect jobs.
“These facilities are about creating opportunities across the fisheries value chain while ensuring long-term sustainability,” Ilakini stated.
The projects support the government’s Coastal Fisheries Spokes and Hubs model, which links remote communities to Alotau for processing and export, aligning with the national goal of a K200 billion economy by 2030 under MTDP-IV.
Additionally, NFA announced plans to reopen the beche-de-mer season later this year, offering further income potential to maritime communities. However, harvesting before the official date remains prohibited.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Better policies needed to support smallholder farmers,23/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4107,"Smallholder farmers and the private sector, through large-scale agriculture companies, have been acknowledged by the Livestock Development Corporation Limited for living up to the tough times.
LDC Managing Director, Terry Koim, stressed the need for policy and regulatory reforms, better data collection, and partnerships with private investors to support smallholder farmers and develop the livestock industry.
Koim acknowledged several local industries like Zenag, Niugini Tablebirds, Ramu Agri and Duran farm, who persisted through the difficult times to supply fresh meat in the country.
“We want to see how we can work with them to improve the sector. We will be having a consultation meeting in the coming weeks, and we’d like to have their input on the policies that we are developing,” Koim said.
LDC was established in 1982 by the Somare Government, but operations declined in 1992 due to mismanagement and political interference. When the Marape-led government took over in 2019, it pushed for the revitalization of the Livestock Development Corporation, beginning with the appointment of a new Board in 2020.
The establishment of the new board has seen the reclamation of over 30,000 hectares of land, reviving cattle stocks, staff capacity building, and good governance measures.

How NRL Entry Will Elevate PNG’s Tourism Potential,19/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4060,"The inclusion of PNG in the NRL by 2028 presents a significant opportunity to boost tourism, leveraging the nation's deep-rooted passion for rugby league and its rich cultural and natural attractions.
Rugby league holds a unique status in PNG, being the national sport and a unifying force across the country. The establishment of an NRL team is anticipated to serve as a major driver for sports tourism, attracting international visitors and spotlighting the nation's tourism offerings.
Recently, the PNG Tourism Promotion Authority (TPA) and Mineral Resource Development Company (MRDC) and their partners hosted the Inaugural Tourism Conference and Expo fostering dialogue through a session exploring investment opportunities in the tourism industry and hospitality sector.
Chief Executive Officer for PNG NRL Franchise, Andrew Hill, highlighted a strategic focus on sports tourism.
Hill said, “Because what sport does, it brings people together. It brings people together here in PNG more than just about anything else and it also brings people together form wider circles around the world.
“In the first instance we know that NRL matches, international matches, will bring enormous opportunity for PNG to showcase ourselves to the world, a global audience watches our sport every weekend.
“That is the opportunity for PNG.
“To create a genuine tourism opportunity through this rugby league franchise.”
Hill emphasized the importance of seamless and effective transportation, guaranteed safety and managing perceptions of PNG.
“How will we leave the sports stadium at 10 o’clock at night in Port Moresby in four years and get back to our hotel. We need to address that question and we need to address it together with a sense of maturity and understanding, not fearful, we need to deliver an answer. Lucky for us, we’ve got three or four years,” stated Hill.
He said what is known about sports tourism is that people travel to a location for more than just the game.
“They come for more than the eighty (80) minutes. They generally come for the three- or four-day period. They’re gonna be looking for things to do in Port Moresby. What are the recreational options in Port Moresby, I ask you because I need the answer, I need to sell 15,000 plus tickets every fortnight, not only is it about a rugby league game, it’s about an experience of looking at a new part of the world that is an unknown.”
Hill alluded to the potential for PNG to tap into the huge potential that the NRL could contribute to the country’s economy through tourism come 2028, stating that in 2024, according to the Victorian government, one state of origin game generated 40 million Australian dollars to the Melbourne economy.
Furthermore, In March 2024, the NRL regular season games were held outside Australia and New Zealand for the first time in Las Vegas, United States. The 2024 event saw Manly Warringah beat South Sydney and Sydney beat Brisbane. This one-day event generated for the state of Nevada 100 million Australian dollars with 40,000 visitors traveling into the state from Australia, New Zealand and England to support their teams.
“I’ve been coming to PNG for 20 years – we need to understand what opportunity this NRL franchise will bring for the country. How best do we take advantage of it, what examples can we look at?”","Sports, Anticipation",Sports,Anticipation
KMHL pays K54 million dividend,17/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4035,"Kumul Mineral Holdings Limited has delivered a dividend of K54.25 million to the state today from its Ok Tedi Mine operations, a testament to the transformation taking place at Ok Tedi in both management and production.
Ok Tedi Mining Limited Board Chairman, Dr. Ila Temu presented the cheque to the Minister for State Owned Enterprise William Duma today in Port Moresby.
Ok Tedi Mining Limited has been consistent with its dividend payments, ensuring its shareholders receive their shares in a timely manner.
Today, it paid the dividends for the last quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025, to a total value of K54.25 million kina.
Ok Tedi Board Chairman, Dr. Ila Temu in thanking the management of Ok Tedi for another successful windfall, also highlighted the factors that contributed to achieving this result, among them the commissioning of new processing equipment and the leadership of the OTML CEO/MD, Kedi Ilimbit.
“Ok Tedi has in recent years invested in newer technology, especially in processing. That’s resulted in an increase in the production numbers – so physical increase in the numbers because of spending money to put in place new technology. The other thing is that the prices have been really good,” Dr. Temu said.
With global gold prices at an all-time high, Ok Tedi’s income last year was K1.5 billion US Dollars, surpassing its target by 300 million US Dollars.
State Enterprise Minister, William Duma applauded KMHL for the dividend payment.
“Both Ok Tedi and Kumul Mineral Holding Limited have continued to perform on many occasions beyond our expectations,” Duma exclaimed.
Under the leadership of the OTML CEO, Kedi Ilimbit, many Papua New Guineans working in mines overseas have been brought back to work in Ok Tedi Mine, and the good results from this mine can also be attributed to the expertise put in by these Papua New Guineans.
“A good example is that Ok Tedi mine has had water problems in the pit for many, many years. So this year or last year is the first time that that issue has been fully resolved. So he brought back the guys from the US, Papua New Guineans in the US for example, who have come in and have driven that agenda. They have cleaned out the water, and that’s a big, big job,” Dr Temu acclaimed.
Minister Duma testified at how competent Papua New Guineans are and how they can deliver when there is no political interference.
“When given the opportunity, our nationals have that inherent ability to perform in any country, anywhere, meet the standards. They are just as competent as anyone in the world.”
Ok Tedi Mine continues to deliver positive results with the life of this mine now extended to 2050 and the board is now strategizing to explore other mining opportunities both in country and overseas.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
NRI on loan accessibility for entrepreneurs,17/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4034,"Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are vital sources of livelihood for a large segment of the population and significant contributors to the revenue of Papua New Guinea.
Therefore, growing the MSME sector can be directly equated with enhancing the country's economy.
However, the growth of MSMEs in PNG has consistently been hindered by insufficient business financing, primarily due to high interest rates and the lack of secure collateral required by local banks and financial institutions, among other factors. Since this rapidly expanding sector of the economy requires adequate financing, the government has introduced a small business loan scheme to support it.
A question that can be asked is whether small business owners in need of financial assistance ever access this government-financed credit facility.
The National Research Institute of PNG (PNGNRI) has released Discussion Paper No. 216, titled “Entrepreneurs’ Experience Seeking Government-Supported Small Business Loans in Papua New Guinea” by Kepha Pondi, Francis Odhuno, and Charles Wapinien.
This paper indicates that there are gaps in accessing government-supported credit financing and highlights the need for awareness and access to government-financed loans to enhance MSMEs. The MSME sector can serve as the engine of national economic growth for the country if it has access to market resources, including financing and a suitable enabling environment. The recommendations provided in the Paper can improve the quality of loan applications and alleviate small business owners' fears about loan application rejections.
Policy adjustments are essential because the results presented in the Discussion Paper suggest that the government-guaranteed loan scheme can act as a catalyst for the growth of MSMEs and, ultimately, the expansion of the country’s economy.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

The real challenge of rural agriculture,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4004,"Coffee farmers in Nivi, in the Unggai-Bena district of Eastern Highlands Province, are forced to shoulder heavy coffee bags and walk long distances to sell their produce.
While PNG looks forward to celebrating its 50th Independence anniversary, most of its rural farmers continue to struggle in an area devoid of government services, especially poor infrastructure, no market accessibility, lack of financial support and a significant neglect in education and healthcare services.
Local farmer Aiakiri Kelly, highlighted their plight after receiving their registration certificate from the Coffee Industry Corporation on Monday, April 14th.
“I’m from behind this mountain,” Kelly pointed to the silhouette of a mountain behind him.
“We have bad roads. So, when we want to go to town, we always carry the coffee bags with us. For women, we will give them 10kg bags while the men can carry 35kg-40kg bags. We shoulder them to the nearest road.
“If the vehicle arrives, we will load it up and go. If it doesn’t show up, we spend the night on the road until the vehicle comes.
“It’s a few kilometres from our village to Goroka town, and life is quite difficult there but God has given us that land to live on.”
Coffee Industry Corporations’ project manager of the PNG Agriculture Commercialization Diversification Project, Potaisa Hombunaka, argued that policymakers in Port Moresby ignore the realities of rural farmers.
“This is the real challenge of agriculture rural development,” he said while a vehicle in the background was struggling uphill on slippery mud in Unggai-Bena.
“We sit in our cool offices in towns and cities, holding conferences and talking about growing the coffee industry, cocoa industry and cattle industry – and the whole lot – but first of all, let’s get our infrastructure done first.
“If the national, provincial and local level governments can get the roads done; that is the number one impediment to the growth of the agriculture sector in-country.”
Unggai-Bena’s terrain has been described as breath-taking but equally challenging for the local populace who need access to government services.
The area produces 1,000-4,000 50kg bags of coffee annually.
Additionally, eighty-five percent of coffee is grown by smallholder coffee growers in the Highlands region.","Agriculture, Sadness",Agriculture,Sadness
World Bank hails PNG’s macroeconomic recovery,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4003,"The World Bank has praised Papua New Guinea’s strong macroeconomic recovery, while urging the Government to urgently channel this momentum into improving human development outcomes across the country.
The message was delivered during a high-level economic briefing in Port Moresby chaired by Prime Minister James Marape and attended by Cabinet Ministers, governors, Members of Parliament, development partners, and institutional heads.
World Bank Group Country Manager, Khwima Nthara and Senior Country Economist Reshika Singh provided a wide-ranging analysis of PNG’s growth trends, development challenges, and the World Bank’s expanding programme of support.
These reinforces the theme that “strong macro foundations must now translate into better lives for ordinary Papua New Guineans.”
The briefing formed part of the “PNG and World Economic Update”, which also featured presentations from the International Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank, Bank of Papua New Guinea, and the Departments of Treasury, Finance and National Planning.
The World Bank highlighted that PNG’s macroeconomic fundamentals have improved markedly since 2022, crediting the Marape Government’s fiscal discipline and reform commitments:
-	Economic growth between 2022–2024 averaged 4.7 percent, up from 3.2 percent in previous decades.
-	Inflation declined from 5 percent in 2020 to just 0.6 percent in 2024.
-	The fiscal deficit has halved in just four years, from nearly 9 percent in 2020 to under 4 percent today—an achievement few countries have managed globally.
“This is extremely commendable,” said Ms Reshika.
“Very few countries have managed to reduce their fiscal deficits by such a margin while maintaining growth.”","Economy, Trust",Economy,Trust
Minister Maru Opens U.S Tariff Review Workshop,16/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/4002,"The Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, this week opened the Consultation Workshop organized by the Department of International Trade and Investment and the National Trade Office on the review of the impact of the new United States (U.S) tariff increases.
He told the participants from both Government and the private sector to provide input on this assessment of the full impact of the new U.S Tarriff increases to major trading partners including Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea and many others.
Minister Maru said, “We must also assess the impact on industries that depend on U.S imports like Air Niugini who mainly import aircraft parts from the U.S. While coffee is one of our major exports to the U.S, can we not replace the U.S market with new markets like Japan and New Zealand instead of depending on the U.S Market? PNG does not impose tariff on services from the U.S and this is one area we need to look at.
“We also need to look at the Fisheries Access we give to the U.S fishing companies who fish and catch tune in our EEZ under our Bilateral Agreement. This is a good opportunity to look at the totality of our overall trade and investment relationship with the U.S. No stones should be left unturned.”
Maru added, “The U.S President Donald Trump claims this action is necessary to make U.S great again. There is so much speculation like the U.S President is doing this as a short-term measure to get the stock market to crash so a lot of his fans and supporters can buy stocks at a very cheap price. Nobody really knows the true intentions behind this U.S decision. Only time will tell whether this is a long-term measure to grow the U.S economy and make U.S great again or it is a short-term measure to achieve some personal agenda.”
Minister Maru further stated that the actions of the U.S has undermined the rules-based multilateral system administered by the World Trade Organization (WTO) which PNG is a member of.
“The U.S is now bringing in protection not seen and experienced by the world in over 10 years and the world has to decide whether to have US in the WTO family or throw the U.S out while the rest of the world carries on with the rules-based multilateral system,” Maru added.
He also told the participants at the workshop to review PNG’s tariff structure and consider what support the Government should be giving especially the manufacturing industry.
Minister Maru requested a full report of the review including recommendations to be presented to the NEC for the Government to consider.
“I want the review completed before the end of this month,” said Minister Maru.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

“This week’s events have been nothing short of extraordinary,” said Uvovo. “We gathered not only to celebrate 50 years of tourism in our beautiful country but to honour the visionaries, communities, and industry builders who laid the foundation for where we are today.”
A major highlight of the event was the tribute paid to three pioneering figures in the industry— the late Sir Peter Barter, the late Max Benjamin, and Bob Bates—during the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Awards at the gala dinner. Uvovo recognised their commitment and lifelong service to shaping PNG tourism.
“To Mr Bates — the last strong man still standing in PNG’s tourism legacy — we salute you. Your resilience and lifelong service are a beacon for the generations to come,” Uvovo added.
More than 300 participants attended the two-day conference, engaging in sector updates, strategic panels, and keynote presentations from both local and international tourism experts.
Day One focused on post-COVID recovery, SME development, sustainability, and financial access, while Day Two looked ahead to investment, infrastructure, connectivity, and destination marketing.
Key speakers included Alan Manning, Moses Wai, Andrew Abel, Dominic Sikakau, Lloyd Piari, Cheyne Benjamin, John Tuaim, Fantasha Lockington, Simon-Marc Brendling, and Dr. Marcus Lee, among others.
Uvovo also acknowledged the support of sponsors, including Platinum Sponsor Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC) and its subsidiaries. Gold sponsors included OK Tedi Mining Limited and ExxonMobil PNG, with Bronze Sponsors being the Department of National Planning & Monitoring and China CSCEC Steel PNG.
“Your investment and belief in the future of PNG tourism empowered us to host this event and recognise the legends of our industry with the honour they deserve,” said Uvovo.
Looking forward, Uvovo said the conference outcomes set the stage for major future events including Expo Osaka 2025 and the PNG-China Tourism Year 2026. He reaffirmed TPA’s commitment to raising industry standards, expanding digital strategies, and improving access to financing.
Uvovo closed by thanking the PNG Tourism Industry Association, the TPA organising team, and all support staff for their dedication in delivering a professional and impactful event.

Slight drop in price of fuel,12/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3962,"The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) this week announced the new retail fuel prices for April 2025, which took effect on Tuesday, 8th of April 2025.
For this month, the Indicative Retail Prices (IRPs) for petrol, diesel and kerosene all decreased on average throughout Papua New Guinea (PNG), consistent with the movements in the international crude oil prices.
The decrease in average crude oil prices in March 2025 was mainly attributed to lower demand caused by global trade tensions and the United States’ tariffs. The decrease was further exacerbated by market sentiments on plans to increase crude oil supply by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC).
The domestic retail fuel prices (IRPs) for this month are inclusive of the Import Parity Prices (IPPs) or the imported costs for each petroleum product, domestic sea and road freight rates for the second quarter of 2025, the approved annual wholesale and retail margins for 2025 and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), including the applicable excise duties, among other parameters.
In Port Moresby: Petrol K4.29 per liter, Diesel K4.01 per liter, and Kerosene K3.72 per liter.
Retail prices in all other designated centers will change according to their quarterly approved domestic freight rates for the second quarter of 2025, and their respective annual retail margins for this year. For all other centers, the maximum retail prices for each regulated petroleum product will change on average consistent with the changes observed for Port Moresby.
As part of the ICCC's enforcement and compliance of fuel prices, ICCC Officers have been conducting inspections on service stations to ensure prices of declared petroleum products comply with the allowable maximum prices.
The prices set by the ICCC are the indicative maximum retail prices, for which retailers may choose to sell below the ICCC approved maximum price.
Whilst retailers may choose to set fuel prices on their pumps to one decimal place, the ICCC will continue to set the maximum price to 2 decimal places. ICCC advises that no fuel pump operator should charge above the Indicative Retail Price for this month's price regardless of the number of decimal places. This is to ensure compliance with the Prices Regulation Act under which the maximum prices of declared petroleum products are set. Retailers who are displaying prices to 1 decimal place are urged by the ICCC to round the prices down to ensure prices are within the allowable indicative retail prices.
ICCC Inspectors will continue to conduct spot checks to ensure on-going compliance by retail fuel operators.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
Big Rooster receives government assistance,12/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3960,"During the chaotic events of January 10 2024, many businesses were affected significantly. Yesterday the government presented a cheque of one million kina to one of Papua New Guinea’s household fast food businesses, Big Rooster.
The funds were part of Phase 3 of Government Assistance to Businesses' affected by January 10, 2024 riots.
Acting Chief Secretary to Government, Ivan Pomaleu, presented the cheque to Big Rooster Managing Director, Salim
Chamadia, to resuscitate the business and keep it running and serving the country.
“Big Rooster, obviously a household name for many of us, they lost business premises, the biggest one being the Badili and Koki businesses and we value, firstly, the patience and we understood the extent of the damages that business incurred and losses and difficulties of rebuilding,” said Pomaleu.
Pomaleu said the funds are by no means the full extent of what Big Rooster requires and is considered an initial payment. He said they are committed to continue to support Big Rooster and other businesses who suffered the effects of the riots.
Late 2024 saw K50 million released as the second tranche of a K270 million relief package to support businesses affected by last year’s riots. So far, the government has cleared 33.4 million kina and a balance of 17million in business support remains for clearance and sits with the processes with the Department of Finance.
“Thank you so much, you're doing your best within the limits and difficulties that we go through, but recognizing us and we keep looking forward to more assistance sooner the better. But whatever is done, you know, we appreciate all the time because it will help us go through the process,” said Chamadia.
Furthermore, with the assistance given by the Government, over the next five years, Big Rooster’s primary objective will be to stabilize and strengthen the business by consolidating operations, enhancing customer experience, upgrading store infrastructure and streamlining supply chain logistics. This phase will focus on building a solid foundation in preparation for broader franchising.
They intend to gradually franchise select outlets to local entrepreneurs under strict and training framework.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
"China to increase tariffs on US goods to 125 per cent, up from 84 per cent",12/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3956,"China will impose 125 per cent tariffs on US goods, up from the 84 per cent previously announced, the finance ministry says.
The new tariffs will start from Saturday, Chinese local time.
China says US tariffs defy ""basic economic laws and common sense"".
In his first public comments about the US-China trade war, President Xi Jinping said there were ""no winners"" in a tariff war.
He called on China and the European Union to jointly oppose unilateral bullying, a reference to US President Donald Trump's tariff regime, while meeting with the Spanish prime minister in Beijing.
The US administration was sticking to its guns on Friday, touting its discussions with a number of countries on new trade deals, which it says will justify its dramatic upheaval in policy.
""We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY. Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly,"" Mr Trump posted on social media on Friday.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who met with Mr Xi on Friday, said Beijing and Washington needed to hold talks to defuse the situation, and he also called for a more balanced relationship between Beijing and the 27-nation EU, which has its own trade issues with China.
""China has always regarded the EU as an important pole in a multipolar world, and is one of the major countries firmly supporting the EU's unity and growth,"" Mr Xi told Mr Sanchez during their talks, according to the Xinhua news agency.
""China and the EU should fulfil their international responsibilities, jointly safeguard the trend of economic globalisation and the international trade environment, and jointly oppose unilateral acts of bullying,"" Mr Xi added.
US markets opened lower on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 100.2 points at the open, while the S&P 500 fell 12.5 points at the bell.
""Recession risk is much, much higher now than it was a couple of weeks ago,"" said Adam Hetts, global head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson.
The White House clarified earlier that Mr Trump's announcement of 125 per cent import taxes on Chinese goods was in addition to earlier tariffs, bringing the total since he was inaugurated less than three months ago to 145 per cent.
The 125 per cent figure did not account for the 20 per cent tariff placed on China earlier this year, ostensibly to punish it for doing too little to stop fentanyl shipments to the US.
Mr Trump has said he is hopeful of making a deal with Mr Xi.
""He's been a friend of mine for a long period of time, and I think that we'll end up working out something that's very good for both countries,"" Mr Trump said.
China says US tariffs 'will become a joke'
China blasted the US president's tariffs as a ""numbers game"" that ""will become a joke"", in a finance ministry statement.
A spokesperson for Beijing's commerce ministry said it had ""become a numbers game with no practical significance in economics"".
""It will only further expose the United States's bullying and coercion. It will become a joke,"" they said.
It added that the US ""should bear full responsibility"" for any global turbulence or tariff war.
China's mission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Friday it had filed an additional complaint to the trade body over US tariffs.
""On 10 April, the United States issued the Executive Order, announcing a further increase of the so-called 'reciprocal tariff' on Chinese products, China filed a WTO complaint against United States' latest tariff measures,"" the statement from China's mission said.
""Reciprocal tariffs"" and countermeasures could have a catastrophic impact, even worse than foreign aid cuts, on developing countries, the director of the United Nations's trade agency Rebeca Grynspan said.
Global trade could shrink by 3-7 per cent and global GDP by 0.7 per cent, with developing countries the worst affected, the International Trade Centre said.
Pamela Coke-Hamilton, the executive director of the International Trade Centre, said this burgeoning war could have a ""catastrophic"" impact on developing countries.
""If this escalation between China and the US continues, it will result in an 80 per cent reduction in trade between the countries, and the ripple effect of that across the board can be catastrophic,"" she said.

IRC hosts session with Lae private sector,10/04/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3936,"The Internal Revenue Commission conducted a breakfast session with the Lae business community this morning, where they outlined some of the tax relief measures introduced by the national government.
The key relief measures are: zero-rated Goods and Services Tax on 13 essential items; simplified tax filing for small businesses, where businesses earning below the K1.5 million threshold can now file GST returns on a quarterly basis, and not monthly; and first-home buyer incentives – where the stamp duty exemption has been raised from K500,000 to K700,000.
A topic that needed more awareness was the superannuation tax exemption where, under the new reform, individuals who have worked for 15 years or more will now enjoy “full exemption” from tax on their superannuation withdrawals.
Speaking with media after the session, IRC Commissioner General, Sam Koim, said as a tax administration, they are not just interested in collecting taxes but also, would like to help ease the burden of tax compliance.
“In the last budget, there were a couple of changes that were made and a lot of reliefs were offered as well, including the ‘basket of goods’ for the 13 essential items to help ease the (burden) on households. Our team is working to have that relief effected in July this year,” said Koim.
“There’s also a relief where taxpayers are now exempted from coming to the tax office every time when they exhaust their limit. So now, they at least have a K1.5 million to remit the offices.”
The essential goods that the IRC is looking at lowering their cost will include rice, canned fish, cooking oil and soap.
During the session, the Commissioner of Tax, Sam Loi, said their team is currently gathering information, adding business houses should anticipate a survey to determine which brands are commonly sold, in what sizes, and to also see how sales codes are applied to the different items.
This reform will be implemented in collaboration with the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) to monitor compliance and “ensure businesses pass on the tax savings to consumers”.
The Lae Chamber of Commerce and Industry recently raised its concern that a clearer definition and process is required with regard to the zero-rated GST on essential goods.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

This is critical to secure our future market in Japan for our marine and fisheries resources, our coffee and other products including LNG. I will also call on the private sector during my visit to secure local sponsorship for our Commercial Facility and the venue for our PNG-Japan Trade and Investment Conference in Tokyo which will be officially opened by the Prime Minister in July during his official visit for the PNG National Day,” said Minister Maru.

"CPL, Eliseo get K4million each in government assistance",31/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3817,"CPL Group and Eliseo were today paid K4million each under phase 3 of the Government Assistance to businesses affected by the 2024 January 10 riots.
Acting Chief Secretary to Government Ivan Pomaleu oversaw the cheque presentations today at the office of the Chief Secretary in Port Moresby.
In his remarks before the presentation, the Acting Chief Secretary informed the press that the phase 3 of the government support is to help businesses who qualify, after stringent screening process supported by the PNG Business Council and the Port Moresby Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
He said phase 3 is to support those businesses whose properties were destroyed during the riots to rebuild their business properties to not only provide goods and services to the people but also to help them create employment for Papua New Guineans.
Cheque presented to CPL Group
“It's important just to continue to clarify that we have a working relationship with the business coalition that comprises the PNG Business Council and Port Moresby Chamber of Commerce and Industry in an operating arrangement that all claims for payments are processed and the business coalition signs off on those claims before they come to our team here in the department to process,” Mr. Pomaleu said.
“We continue to encourage compliance with all business regulations so while we are indebted to companies that may have lost businesses during the riots, we must continue to be consistent in terms of our conversation and requirements relating to government compliance.”
Cheque presented to Eliseo
Mr Pomaleu informed the media that the total funding made available to assist businesses by a National Executive Council is K270 million. He said by end of this round of payments, the government would have spent K101 million from the K270 million. Phase 3 assistance is valued around K51 million and after the handing over of the cheques today, the total value paid under Phase 3 so far would be K31 million (including the K25 million paid last week).
He said there are four phases to the government assistance. Phase one is the wage support that was paid last year to cover wages for National employees, estimated at around K8.7million. Phase 2 is payment to businesses who qualified to get government assistance to remove debris from their properties which were destroyed. In phase 3, funding is now being made available, again to those businesses who qualify, to rebuild their business infrastructure. Phase 4 will involve dialogue with the businesses and commercial banks to make available concessional loans to businesses who qualify under the government assistance scheme to have access to those loan facilities.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Paita plans to move mining dept to Lae,31/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3812,"The new Mining Minister and Member for Finschhafen, Rainbo Paita, plans to move the mining department to Lae, in Morobe Province.
He outlined his intention during his first visit as the mining minister to the mining township of Wau on Friday, March 28th.
“The mining department and Mineral Resources Authority are in Port Moresby,” he told locals at the Grace Memorial Secondary School. “We don’t have a mine in Port Moresby.
“I will ask the Prime Minister and Cabinet if I could move the mining department to Morobe, in Lae. This is so that officials can sit close to where the mine and alluvial gold is.
“They can be able to see if the mine is operating well, if the environment is ok, if society is well and if schools are running or not. They should not be guessing in Port Moresby.
“It is not that I am from Morobe. No. There were major mining operations in the past in Wau-Bulolo, now currently in Wau, we have Hidden Valley, and I believe that Lae is a central location that Oro can access, Madang can access as well so we should build an office here.
“Many of you are landowners but you find it difficult to go to Port Moresby,” he said as the crowd loudly voiced its assent in the downpour.
“This is why the office must be located here so resource owners can access government workers.”
Paita was in Wau following an invitation from Wau-Waria MP and Our Pati member, Marsh Narewec, who needed the new mining minister to address many pending issues from his electorate, including the process of issuing mining leases, environmental and infrastructural damage caused by alluvial mining due to non-regulation and the partnership between locals and foreigners in alluvial mining, which is a reserved business.
Paita shared his plans after making a commitment to work with the Morobe Provincial Administration to conclude the Wafi-Golpu mine development contract (MDC).
He also intends to stop foreigners’ participation in alluvial mining and aims to empower local miners by supporting them with alluvial mining equipment under a program similar to the government’s SME policy.
Paita and Menyamya MP, Solen Loifa, were in Wau to officiate at a number of education project launches and groundbreaking, including the opening of a 4-in-1 teachers’ accommodation at the Grace Memorial Secondary School, the groundbreaking of a new Wau Flexible Open & Distance Education Centre, a new Wau Primary School 4-in-1 classroom and the groundbreaking of a new Technical and Vocational Education and Training project.","Politics, Anticipation",Politics,Anticipation
New mining minister visits mining township,31/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3811,"Our Pati leader and Finschhafen MP, Rainbo Paita, made his first visit to the mining township of Wau as the newly appointed Mining Minister on Friday, March 28th.
With Wau-Waria having over 60 active mining leases with many challenges, including the process of issuing mining leases, local MP, Marsh Narewec, is hopeful that the new Minister would progress their agenda.
“Mining minister is a very challenging portfolio and especially Morobe, we have several issues and chief among them is the small-scale mining that is happening in the Wau and Bulolo area,” said Narewec.
“The Member for Bulolo, the Member for Huon Gulf and myself are – according to the mining act – we are not part of the mining development forum. But now that we have a minister from Morobe, we hope that the minister will waiver this requirement and include us, the district development authorities, in the mining development forum so we can, on behalf of our people, represent their views in this forum so it can be captured.”
Other issues include pending applications to renew mining leases, environmental and infrastructural damage caused by alluvial mining due to non-regulation, small-scale miners unable to get mining licences as they are being held by uncooperative corporate organisations, and small-scale miners partnering with foreign developers, who have no respect for the local people, their laws and the environment.
Speaking in Wau, Paita outlined that the local DDA will lead the charge in this week’s Hidden Valley memorandum of agreement review, while the Mineral Resources Authority and his ministry will follow suit.
“No one in Port Moresby will come here and force their agenda on the district,” Paita stated. “So, this is my assurance. When we review the Hidden Valley (MoA) under my leadership, we will collaborate with you to see how we can review it.
“Number two; a task that I want to complete under my department; we in Wau and Bulolo have the highest level of alluvial miners. And this business must be for Papua New Guinean citizens only. But now, we can see that locals have no machinery, no excavator, so we form joint ventures with outsiders.
“I have two objectives to accomplish under this; one is to stop foreigners’ participation in alluvial mining, and two, the government will empower locals by helping them acquire alluvial mining equipment.”
Paita was in Wau to officiate at several education project launches and groundbreaking, including the opening of a 4-in-1 teachers’ accommodation at the Grace Memorial Lutheran School, the groundbreaking of a new Wau Flexible Open & Distance Education Centre, a new Wau Primary School 4-in-1 classroom and the groundbreaking of a new Technical and Vocational Education and Training project.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

CEO highlights Digicel's progress,28/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3786,"The Innovation PNG 2025 conference hosted today in Port Moresby brought together various business and government communities to learn from each other, be inspired by, and connect with leading innovators from both Papua New Guinea and around the globe.
Speaking today at the conference, Digicel PNG’s Chief Executive Officer Tarik Boudiaf, highlighted the company’s 17 years of operations, underscoring that Digicel didn’t just bring mobile phones – it brough inclusion, opportunity, and national progress.
The CEO shared an encounter.
“A few weeks ago, I spoke with a CEO who shared how Digicel changed her life. Growing up in a remote Highlands village with no internet and calls, studying was a challenge. When Digicel expanded its network, everything changed, she said—she accessed online resources, connected with teachers, and joined virtual classrooms. Her story is just one example of how connectivity transforms lives,” he said.
Boudiaf went on to inform the conference that in his nine months as CEO Digicel PNG, he’s seen how the company drives progress, supports national development, and creates new opportunities.
“As PNG’s leading 4G network, we remain committed to expanding connectivity.”
He stated further, “Recently, we invested 20 million Kina to modernize the 4G network in Lae in addition to 115 new towers in Port Moresby and Lae, increasing population coverage by 20%. This investment is about more than infrastructure—it’s about making PNG competitive and future-ready as we approach 50 years of independence.”
Beyond connectivity, the Digicel Foundation continues to support education and digital inclusion and acknowledged the government’s ongoing support in these initiatives.
In bridging the digital divide, Boudiaf said, “Connectivity shouldn’t be limited to cities. Today, our network covers 85% of PNG’s population, including once-unreachable areas. But true digital transformation goes beyond coverage—it creates opportunities in education, healthcare, agriculture, and business.”
Meantime, in driving financial inclusion through CellMoni, he emphasized how Digicel revolutionized the country with connectivity.
“Today, we continue that mission with CellMoni, a mobile wallet that brings financial services to underserved communities. It enables secure, instant transactions, eliminating the need for costly, time-consuming trips to town.
“For city workers, CellMoni makes supporting families simple. With just a Digicel phone—no bank account required—they can instantly send money, pay bills, and top up airtime securely.”
Most importantly, Boudiaf expressed that Digicel is committed to working with the government and partners to drive innovation and expand digital inclusion.
Boudiaf stated, “As leaders in 4G LTE and future-ready technologies, we will continue delivering solutions that empower every Papua New Guinean, wherever they live.
“This conference is an opportunity to shape PNG’s digital future together. The journey ahead is promising—the time for action is now.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

This follows the approval of the audited financial statements by the Board of Trustees last week Friday, 21 March 2025.
Reporting a 3.3 percent growth in Membership to 235,888 Members with a Net Asset Value (NAV) of K11.2 billion and a record NPAT K1.1 billion, the Board declared an interest rate of 10.5 per cent for 2024 for its Members. Members accounts have already been credited over the weekend, with the interest applied to their balances as at 31 December 2024.
This strong performance has been delivered amidst unprecedented challenges faced by the Fund in 2024; from the Black Wednesday riots that shook the country on January 10, to the enormous work undertaken to secure vacant possession of NSL’s 9-Mile land portions after more than 30 years.
Despite these and many other challenges, the Board, Management and Staff remained resolute in putting Members’ interests first and foremost, tirelessly working to deliver strong results in 2024.
Nambawan Super Limited’s incoming Board Chairman, Richard Sinamoi, said that with the ever-increasing law and order issues coupled with increasingly unreliable utilities, all of which significantly add to the challenges and costs of local business operations, NSL also continued to face the ongoing issue of securing adequate foreign currency.
Locally, investment opportunities continued to lag while international markets appreciated, though still very volatile.
“Despite the very tough local and volatile global economic conditions of 2024, I do not doubt that our Members will be happy with the results of their Fund”
Sinamoi noted that;
•	Fund Membership grew by 3.3 percent to 235,888 Members, from 228,319 in 2023.
•	Net Asset Value now totals K11.2 billion, an increase K1.36 billion compared to K9.84 billion in 2023.
•	Net Profit After Tax a record-high of K1.1 billion, representing a significant increase of K425 million from the 2023 NPAT of K659 million.
•	Annual interest rate of 10.5 percent return for Members compared to 7% in 2023.
•	Member Contributions Received totalled K961 million, compared to K970 million in 2023.
•	Member Benefits Paid totalled K703 million paid out through Exits such as resignation; retirement, Death Benefit Payments, Transfers, Unemployment Benefits, Housing Advances and RSA Withdrawals to Members and or Member Beneficiaries, compared to K781 million paid out in 2023.
In addition to the successful 2024 financial results announced by the Chairman, NSL also delivered the following positive outcomes for its Members in 2024, such as:
•	State Share Benefit payments of K55 million paid out to 1,112 Members.
•	Housing Advance of K115 million paid out to support 5,029 Members either purchase, build or improve their homes.
“While 2024 was a challenging year locally, I would like to reiterate that Nambawan Super will continue to deliver on our mandate of protecting our Members superannuation savings, regardless the economic climate,” said Sinamoi.
NSL’s Chief Executive Officer, Paul Sayer added that in 2024, NSL saw an increase in the number of Members across it’s Voluntary Contributions, Choice Super and Retirement Savings Account products.
Sayer said, “An additional 2,000 Members took up Voluntary Contributions in 2024 which is a 6% increase over 2023.”
“We understand that saving for retirement is challenging, particularly during these hard times. I’d like to acknowledge the dedication of our Members who remain steadfast in their goal of achieving a comfortable and financially secure retirement, while balancing the financial pressures of today.”
“Despite these difficulties, our Members continue to persevere, trusting that their superannuation savings will grow stronger under our prudent management.”
“I encourage more Members to continue to save and use this product in order to maximize the interest earned on their savings over the long term. An extra K10 every fortnight can add thousands to your superannuation, through the power of compound interest.”
“While we remain cautiously optimistic, regardless of the challenges and the economic environment in 2025, Members who are considering retirement can rest assured that your funds remain safe and protected by Nambawan Super. Your superannuation savings will be made available to you, including your interest earned and the employer portion received by NSL, once you are ready to exit,” Sayer said.
In closing, Chairman Sinamoi took the opportunity to congratulate Nasfund and Comrade Trustee Services Limited for their strong performance in 2024, and the benefits and security that superannuation industry collectively delivers to its Members.
“Superfunds play a vital role in securing the financial future of their Members, and our collective efforts contribute to a stronger, more secure future for all Papua New Guineans and the country as a whole.”
“In closing, on behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like take this opportunity to thank our Members for your trust and commitment toward building a financially secure and comfortable retirement, during these very difficult times.”
“I also extend my deepest gratitude to the Board of Directors for their leadership and acknowledge the hardworking Management and staff of Nambawan Super throughout the country, for their efforts in delivering outstanding results for our Members in 2024.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
Lae company takes lead in TB program,24/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3722,"A company in Lae, Morobe Province, is taking the lead in raising awareness on tuberculosis, as well as offering counselling and support to its staff.
On Friday, March 21st, an open day was hosted at the Chemcare Group head office to commemorate World Tuberculosis Day.
The company conducted an early commemoration of the event as World TB Day is annually observed on March 24th.
Staff from the Chemcare Group’s different branches around the city were transported to the head office to watch information videos on TB, tour the display by the HR team and be briefed on the company’s workplace policy on TB.
Group HR Manager, Ritha Maisen-Maken, said their TB program was initiated in March 2021 and is hosted annually, with the company having its own TB warden.
“Between 2021 and to date, we’ve had 20 staff across the company – we’ve got roughly about 2,000 staff – so that’s about a percentage of our work population who have been affected,” stated Maisen-Maken.
“Through the program and the policy, we’ve supported to make sure that staff go on special leave as per our policy, they don’t lose their jobs; we allow them to go and they recover. Janet (Elleo) being our TB warden, she’s been doing a fantastic job to help the company push this initiative through.”
The director and general manager of Chemcare Pharmacies, Angus King, alluded to the need to hold conversations around serious subjects like TB, saying, their comprehensive TB program is about self-awareness and is non-discriminatory.
“As a Group – led by Janet and our HR department – the directors completely support the program that was implemented in 2021. More awareness is more support and protection for those staff who are suffering from TB symptoms to ensure that they don’t lose their jobs or they are not marginalised.
“I’ve had discussions with staff with TB; it’s a slow and steady road to recovery but provided they get the support they need.
“I’m very proud, on behalf of the directors, that Chemcare continues to support this on an annual basis. It’s all about education.
“I saw a poster up there that said, ‘It’s got nothing to do with sorcery’. Unfortunately, there are people who still believe that so, the more people learn and get educated about TB – what it’s about and that it is curable – the better.”
The full day program saw staff from different Chemcare branches like Anderson’s Eriku, Rabtrad, Morobe Bakery, Anderson’s Express and Print Fast, take turns in visiting the head office.","Health, Trust",Health,Trust
Work to reclaim Baiyer Cattle Ranch in progress,22/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3701,"The rundown Baiyer River Cattle ranch in Western Highlands Province is in its final leg of reclamation as the Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) works to revive this ranch.
The LDC team first visited Baiyer in July 2021, after receiving directives from the Prime Minister to take stock of all LDC assets across PNG by reclaiming, rehabilitating and restocking all its properties and assets throughout the country.
This initiative is one of the key elements in the MTDP IV 2023 – 2027 for PNG to become self-reliant in meat production by 2030.
According to LDC Managing Director, Terry Koim, there are more than 14 state leases under LDC, which have already been reclaimed and are currently undergoing rehabilitation and restocking.
Baiyer River cattle ranch occupies 4700 hectares of land and Koim stated that it is one of the last properties that will undergo development before LDC moves across the Bismarck range on its final leg of the reclamation project by taking back the Urimo Ranch on the Sepik Plains.
“The Baiyer river cattle ranch was shut down in 1992 with cattle removed to some unknown place at the time. For 32 years, Baiyer was left abandoned but the current Prime Minister gave clear directives to reclaim and to take stock of LDC assets throughout the country. This prompted my team to leave office, get out there and literally take stock of all assets, and to account for what belonged to the state, including infrastructure as well as employees,” he said.
Due to some disagreement and misunderstanding, there were delays to the progress of the reclamation and rehabilitation of the ranch, however all parties reached an understanding to let work progress as this development will provide many opportunities for the community, including jobs, revenue generation and other spin off benefits.
Koim is aware that former employees and other members of nearby communities have unlawfully settled in the
property over time, however the PM’s directives is clear that this is a state land in need of development.
“I am aware that many people have built their lives on this property, hence the LDC management team will give ample time for the settlers to move out. We will not rush into to demolishing any infrastructure that they have put up but we will also not let the infrastructures to remain on this state land,” he said.
On behalf of the landowners, Chairman of Baiyer Land Association, Thompson Ruri acknowledged LDC for returning to progress work as the property had been abandoned for a long time.
During a recent site visit, Koim said the intervention had spared the government and LDC the hassle of having to address illegal settlers on state land, albeit having already a handful on the property.
“This infrastructure was set up by former member Koi Trappe and I would like to thank him for his foresight as without this intervention, settlers would have taken over this land without any restraint”, he said.
MD Koim said this is a show of partnership and collaboration and thus they are hoping that LDC can work closely with the DDA to reclaim and rehabilitate Baiyer River cattle ranch for the benefit of all in the area as well as the neighboring Dei electorate.
“I am looking forward to working with the current member, the honourable Jacob Maki whom I have established dialogue with and he is very positive about this and we will work with the open member as well as the Governor of the Province Hon Wai Rapa to ensure that this ranch is up and running for the betterment of the people of Western Highlands and the greater upper highlands region.”","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

In response to the urgent global and national imperative to address climate change and advance sustainable energy practices, PNG CORE’s Sustainability and Climate Change Committee has conducted a comprehensive review of the Chamber’s strategic direction.
This review has culminated in the development of the Energy Transition and Climate Change policy statements. These policies are now integral components of PNG CORE’s Strategic Intent Agenda and outlines a clear roadmap that contributes to fostering a resilient, sustainable energy future in Papua New Guinea.
The policies were developed through rigorous multi-stakeholder collaboration, including input from the PNG CORE mining committee, Petroleum Industry Working Group, and broader member consultations. They reflect a unified commitment to environmental stewardship, balancing economic growth, climate resilience, and equitable development.
“Aligned with global Net Zero aspirations, PNG CORE envisions a Papua New Guinea where clean, renewable energy drives sustainable development, enhances energy security, and fosters nationwide prosperity,” said PNG CORE Sustainability and Climate Change Committee chairman, Felix Kipalan.
“The mission is to lead this transition by advocating progressive policies, fostering collaboration, and promoting innovation across the resources and energy sectors.
“This transition is not just an environmental imperative but an economic opportunity to position PNG as a leader in sustainable resource development. Together, we can achieve a just, inclusive, and resilient energy future.”","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Lae business breakfast hosted,20/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3682,"A business breakfast with Westpac was hosted this morning at the Lae Yacht Club.
Representatives from different business houses in Lae, Morobe Province, were briefed by senior economist Pacific, Justin Smirk, on the current trends in the global financial market and the impact of changes in US government policies.
The event was facilitated by the Lae Chamber of Commerce and Industry, with President John Byrne outlining that their discussions revolved around the global economic market, particularly US tariffs and subsequent challenges, and how the PNG market would be affected.
“From the local perspective, we have a lot of growth in income and money from our coffee and cocoa and gold,” he stated.
“The effect on inflation was discussed, the effect on foreign exchange. A question was raised about the minimum wage; what effect that will have.”
Byrne stressed that every country is developing, just like PNG. Hence, the impact of what we control or can control, balances off other economies.
He alluded to the potential PNG has for growth, and highlighted the need to introduce tools and programs, and run them ourselves, to better equip our people in agriculture, like coffee and cocoa farmers.
“The minimum wage discussion was an important discussion,” he continued. “Like most, we haven’t had a review in too many years so also, there’s a need to have a minimum wage review.
“And businesses have recognised that. It’s the way it’s implemented and how it affects both the employee and the business, and what impact it has on the community. There’s a downside where, if the wage increases too much, and there’s a downside on the number of people employed; that’s a challenge. We need more people employed. We have formal employment at 5-10 percent in the country. Maximum. So, our challenge is, how do we balance that?”","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Govt to support ENB oil palm farmers recover K38 million,19/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3660,"Following the release of the findings and recommendations from the investigation into the East New Britain Resource Group (ENBRG), the Government will now engage a law firm to act on behalf of the Government to support the landowners in East New Britain (ENB) province to recover the underpayments estimated to be approximately K38,730,637 from the first oil palm plantings in 2009 to October 2024.
Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru made the announcement yesterday, Tuesday 18 March, 2025.
The final report of the investigation including the findings and the recommendations was approved by the NEC last week.
Minister Maru said the two immediate actions the Government would take, following the completion of the investigation, are:
1. Support Landowners in ENB Province recover the K38 Million; and
2. ENBRG must immediately apply the same national price formula used by Hargy and New Britian Palm Oil.
“As soon as the Department of Justice and Attorney General briefs out a law firm, I will travel with the lawyers to Kokopo to meet with the company and the landowners and the ENB Provincial Government to begin the process of immediate negotiations on how to recover the estimated K38 million suffered by the landowners due to underpayments by the company. The Government would like to do an out-of-court settlement on all the issues related to this crisis including pricing, land deals and others. If that fails then legal actions would be last resort. We will also ensure to help the oil palm growers and their families in ENB Province see 500-600% increase in the oil palm prices, similar to farmers in West New Britain Province.”
“At the same time, we will work with the Ministry of Oil Palm to put together a foundational legislation to govern the operations of the oil palm industry and its management into the future,” he added.
The findings and recommendations are a result of an investigation that was approved by the NEC in its Decision No: 192/2024, following a petition that was presented to Minister Maru by the local oil palm growers and landowners of Gazelle Peninsula and the Wider Bay Area of ENB Province, calling for an investigation into the exploitation of an unfair trade practice by the East New Britain Palm Oil Limited (ENBPOL) for illegal price fixing of K10 per metric ton for Fresh Fruits Bunch payments from November 2014 to 2022, and K15 per metric ton from 2023-2024. The Investigation Team led by an oil palm expert, David Mather and Deputy Chairman, Tony Waisi was carried out over 8 weeks from November 19 to December 17, 2024, and from January 16 to February 12, 2025. The Investigation Team found out that ENBPOL was part of the ENBRG which comprises of ENBPOL and Tzen Niugini Limited and Tzen Plantations Limited, and so the Investigation Team extended the investigation to cover the ENBRG and not just ENBPOL.
Minister Maru said, “This is not just another investigation that will be gathering dust in Waigani like most other expensive investigations. I will ensure that we take actions based on the recommendations and we will start with these two immediate actions so the exploitation of our farmers and our people must never happen again. After 50 years of Independence, we must mature and put an end to the foreign exploitation of our people in our own country and in our own land. This should be a stern warning to all palm oil investors and generally all investors throughout Papua New Guinea that you must not do land grabbing, shady deals, and you must pay our people the right prices.
Exploiting our people and their land will not be tolerated whatsoever by the Marape-Rosso Government. We are taking firm action to make sure that this does not happen again.”
Minister Maru further stated, “We fully understand that the people of ENB Province want further investigation into Sigite-Mukas Oil Palm Project in West Pomio. As far as I am concerned, the Investigation Team are happy to investigate, that is if the investigation will be funded by the ENB Provincial Government.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
PNG Fisheries Launches Digital Traceability,18/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3637,"The National Fisheries Authority (NFA) launched the Fisheries Automated Registration and Information System (FARIS), a digital platform designed to enhance traceability, governance, and marketing of Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified fish.
The platform aligns with international best practices and integrates with global systems, including Global Fishing Watch, Global Dialogue on Seafood Traceability, and the UN Global Information Exchange System.
This advancement places Papua New Guinea at the forefront of sustainable and transparent fisheries management.
NFA Managing Director Justin Ilakini, while unveiling FARIS, described it as a ""historic moment for the fisheries sector.""
He emphasised that the system was developed locally, ensuring efficient data access and regulatory compliance.
“Today marks a vision we started 18 months ago. FARIS ensures NFA has a system in place that allows for data to be seamlessly obtained at our fingertips. I am proud because this system is home-grown and built by us, for us,” Ilakini stated.
FARIS represents the NFA’s commitment to government policy directives, stakeholder expectations, and citizen-centric service delivery.
It also offers a potential model for other government agencies to streamline their operations.
Beyond PNG, FARIS provides a regional alternative for bilateral partners and fisheries organizations seeking digital transformation in business processes and traceability solutions.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
Maru confident to launch cannery in April,15/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3613,"Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru happily reports that efforts to launch Papua New Guinea’s historical first cannery in Madang Province is on track with confirmation that the project will be launched in April.
During question time in Parliament on Thursday 13 March, a question without notice was posed to Minister Maru by the Member for Bogia, Robert Naguri, seeking updates regarding the development of the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ).
Minister Maru says as minister responsible for the development of the PMIZ, his ministry has led efforts to seek feasible investment that best benefits the country.
“We have some constraints that parliament and people need to understand. To develop PMIZ you need a wharf for the fish catches to be landed at the PMIZ, we don’t have a wharf.  You need water, we don’t have sufficient water supply for ten canneries. You need power, we don’t even have that. So, we have some serious constraints in trying to develop PMIZ.”
Maru said his department assessed that the easiest way to develop the PMIZ project to bring it online as soon as possible would be to enter into a Joint Venture (JV) with RD Tuna Canners as their facility in Madang already has a wharf. Located next to state land where the National Fisheries Authority also has a cold storage facility in the area.
“Those are two important factors,” Maru emphasized.
Maru says he is awaiting legal clearance from the State Solicitor to take the proposal for JV to the National executive Council.
The JV if approved, will mean Papua New Guinea for the first time will own 50% of the country’s first cannery with RD Tuna Canners owning the other half.
Maru said the state is ready with an equity of K80 million and is confident that Prime Minister will launch the cannery in April.
“It will be a very historic achievement for any government since independence because for the first time we will have a PNG owned cannery in the fisheries sector.”
Minister Maru further stated that the proposal that he will present to cabinet once given clearance by State Solicitor will include provisions to ensure the empowerment of Papua New Guineans.
“I will be proposing that Madang provincial government must be given 10% equity, Sumkar and Madang districts 5% each. They should be free carried and paid for by the government.”","Business, Joy",Business,Joy

Through this initiative, the association is helping local farmers transition from conventional methods to more efficient, sustainable agricultural practices that can help improve both the quality and quantity of rice production.","Agriculture, Anticipation",Agriculture,Anticipation
Pomio puts trust in Cocoa Budding training,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3593,"Cocoa farmers in Central Pomio LLG in East New Britain province are embracing a transformative budding initiative under the Global Environment Facility’s (GEF) Food Systems, Land Use, and Restoration (FOLUR) project.
Thirty farmers from six targeted communities underwent intensive training in coco budding techniques training between February 21 and March 7.
The farmers from Galuwe, Marmar, Pomio, Sali, Olaipun 1, and Olaipun 2 were assisted by six certified cocoa budders and supervised by the Cocoa Board of PNG.
The training aimed to improve cocoa quality and yield by equipping farmers with essential skills in budding and nursery management.
Each community selected five participants; 3 males and 2 females, who, upon meeting performance standards, will become certified budders in pursuit of strengthening local expertise and ensuring sustainability.
The Cocoa Board of PNG provided 18 varieties of cocoa clone materials to establish budwood gardens across the six sites. These gardens are expected to boost productivity, reduce pest infestations, and enhance yields in the long run.
Donald Songavare, a research officer with Cocoa Board’s Breeding Section with his team, played a crucial role in assessing and tagging different cocoa clone varieties for certification (in the existing four budwood gardens of farmers in the community).
“Quality cocoa starts with high-standard planting materials, and the Cocoa Board has put in place guidelines to ensure farmers receive the best materials,” Songavare said.
He emphasized that only researched and approved cocoa clones should be planted, with Tavilo currently serving as the main seed garden.
Meanwhile, Agmark is preparing to ship nursery materials to Central Pomio, with the Cocoa Board's technical guidance ensuring the establishment of 14 nurseries, seven in Central Pomio and seven in Inland Baining, starting in April 2025.
The training included aligning the budwood gardens associated with cocoa nursery sites for each community, supplied with 180 budded materials which will become the source of clone materials for each community with support from Central LLG into the future.
With cocoa playing a vital role in the local economy, initiatives like these are crucial for empowering farmers and fostering resilience in the face of climate and market challenges. As the project progresses, stakeholders, including the District Rural Development Office (DRDO) Pomio District, and the East New Britain Provincial Administration’s Division of Agriculture and Livestock (DAL), are committed to ongoing collaboration to revitalize cocoa farming in Central Pomio LLG.
Local ward members and experienced cocoa budders from Cocoa Board have also expressed their enthusiasm for the initiative.
“For years, our farmers have struggled with aging cocoa trees and low yields. This training is giving them the knowledge and skills to revitalize their farms and secure better incomes for their families,” said Marmar Ward Member in Central Pomio, William Longkale.
Peter Mire, Ward Member from Galue, emphasized the long-term benefits of adopting best practices in cocoa management.
“This is more than just a training session; it’s a step towards ensuring that our cocoa industry remains strong for future generations. The farmers now understand the significance of nursery management and proper budding techniques.” Mire said.
Peter Kuplie, a cocoa budder, added that budding is an effective way to introduce high-yielding and disease-resistant varieties.
“The farmers here have shown great interest, and we are confident that they will apply these techniques to rejuvenate their cocoa farms.” Kuplie said.
The community remains hopeful that this budding initiative will mark the beginning of a brighter future for the cocoa industry.","Agriculture, Joy",Agriculture,Joy
ENB oil palm farmers suffer K38m loss,14/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3590,"The oil palm growers in East New Britain Province have suffered an estimate loss of approximately K38,730,637 in underpayments from the first palm oil plantings from 2009 to October 2024.
Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru presented these findings from the Final Report of the investigation into the East New Britain Resources Group, comprising East New Britain Palm Oil Limited, Tzen Niugini Limited and Tzen Plantation Limited.
The losses of over K38 million occurred in the absence of a mandatory price formula for ‘Fresh Fruit Bunches’ (FFBs) for small growers and a standard template for Benefit Sharing Agreement with landowners.
Minister Maru clarified that the losses suffered or “underpayments” to landowners were calculated based on the “normal industry practice’’ or what New Britain Palm Oil Limited was paying for its Fresh Fruit Bunch small growers and landowners compared to what East New Britain Resources Group was paying over a period of 10 years from October 2014 to October 2024.
Maru highlighted that this 12-page report is the first time in the country’s history that the Government is investigating the price of oil palm upon receiving complaints from over 15,000 village oil palm farmers in East New Britain, who have requested the Government’s intervention to help them and their families see a 500-600% increase in the oil palm prices, similar to farmers in West New Britain Province.
The K2 million National Executive Council (NEC) approved investigation found that the former Chief Executive Officer (not named in report) is largely responsible for the issues related to oil palm development associated with the East New Britain Resources Group in East New Britain Province, as well as the significant issues to be addressed by East New Britain Resources Group and the losses suffered by its associated landowner stakeholders.
Although the investigation team were unable to obtain all the necessary information, the current Chief Operating Officer of East New Britain Resources Group provided valuable assistance, as did representatives from the Investment Promotion Authority, Independent Consumer and Competition Commission, and the Department of Lands and Physical Planning.
Due to the limited information available, broad assumptions and calculations were made to estimate landowner stakeholder losses.
The report made thirty (30) recommendations, listed below are only five:
1.	Develop a PNG Palm Oil Policy and Legislation.
2.	Establish a National Palm Oil Council / Authority.
3.	Refocus the Oil Palm Industry Corporation (OPIC) to better service smallholder oil palm growers.
4.	An immediate, independently managed, review of the WB, Special Agricultural Development Project, Smallholder Price Formula, then mandate.
5.	Derive Mandatory Landowner FFB Royalty Payments from the Smallholder FFB Price Formula.
Minister Maru says the findings and recommendations from this investigation will guide the Government to reform the oil palm industry to ensure that such rip off of Papua New Guinean farmers does not happen through policy and legislation.
“The findings and recommendations of this investigation will be important to all key stakeholders, the growers and landowners, the oil palm developers, this Government, and key Government agencies who may need to take hold of the report and implement changes,” Maru stated.
He further assured, “The Marape-Rosso Government will act firmly on the complaints from our farmers so we can get a far better package to encourage our people to free up land for oil palm development. We also want to send a clear message to all foreign investors that under the watch of the Marape-Rosso Government, no foreign investor will be allowed to cheat and rob our people from the fruit of their sweat and labor on their own land.
“This investigation will form the basis of the policy and the legislation that will be put together to govern the operations of the oil palm industry and its management into the future.”","Business, Anger",Business,Anger

FPDA highlights importance of fresh produce,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3519,"The Fresh Produce Development Agency (FPDA) presented a detailed report at a high-level agriculture meeting chaired by Prime Minister James Marape recently highlighting the importance of fresh produce in import substitution, food security, and employment creation.
The report detailed 2024 achievements, challenges, and the strategic roadmap for 2025 and beyond.
Speaking at the meeting, FPDA Chief Executive Officer Mark Worinu emphasised the growing importance of Papua New Guinea’s fresh produce and horticulture industry, which is valued at K3 billion.
However, he noted that PNG continues to spend K2.8 billion on food imports, with K60 million annually allocated to fresh produce imports alone.
This demonstrates a significant gap and opportunity for local farmers to increase production and supply the domestic market.
Mr Worinu said FPDA’s focus is on ensuring that Papua New Guinea can replace imports with local production, enhance market accessibility, and develop value-added processing industries that will benefit smallholder farmers and agribusinesses.
The FPDA’s 2024 achievements demonstrated strong progress in farmer training, production expansion, market development, and economic impact.
Some key outcomes include:
1. Farmer Capacity Building and Income Growth
-	6,008 farmers trained and capacitated in technical farming, market access, and production.
-	550 farmers profiled and supported with extension services.
-	Farmers collectively earned K13.1 million from fresh produce sales.
2. Increased Production of Key Crops
-	Assorted vegetable production reached 2,423 tonnes, supplying major markets.
-	Potato Industry Growth:
-	Local production of Ware-G5 potatoes reached 15,141 tonnes.
-	Imported potato volume stood at 10,097 tonnes, reinforcing the need to scale local production.
-	The total value of local potato production was K49.7 million, while imports were valued at K57 million.
-	Bulb Onion Expansion:
-	Local production increased by 4%, reaching 3,000 tonnes, compared to 2,000 tonnes in 2023.
-	The total value of local bulb onions was K5.25 million, up from K2.3 million in 2023.
-	Imported onion volume stood at 10,457 tonnes, valued at K59.1 million, reflecting the urgent need for local industry growth.
3. Downstream Processing and MSME Development
To promote value addition and economic growth, FPDA facilitated:
-	The establishment of 25 new farms to expand production.
-	The creation of 11 Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) focused on processing and packaging.
-	The introduction of downstream processing initiatives, including:
-	The production of cookies, buns, flours, doughnuts, noodles, and biscuits using locally grown fresh produce.
-	Fruit juice and flour processing ventures to expand market opportunities.
Mr Worinu highlighted that despite these achievements, FPDA encountered several challenges in implementing its programmes, in 2024 including:
-	Budget Constraints:
-	The government allocated K20.5 million for horticulture in 2024, but only K18.5 million was received and spent.
-	K2 million in funding was not released, impacting some planned activities.
-	Market Access Barriers:
-	While demand for fresh produce in Port Moresby alone is estimated at 270,000 tonnes, only 15,840 tonnes currently reach the market, demonstrating the need for improved logistics, storage, and supply chain efficiency.
-	Limited Infrastructure:
-	The absence of sufficient cold storage and transport facilities affects post-harvest quality and increases waste.
-	Import Dependency:
-	The continued reliance on imported fresh produce, especially bulb onions and potatoes, underscores the need for increased domestic production and improved value chain efficiency.
The high-level agriculture meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Marape, emphasised the government’s strong commitment to agriculture as a key pillar of economic growth. The Prime Minister commended FPDA’s efforts in driving fresh produce development and reaffirmed government support for initiatives aimed at increasing food security and employment opportunities.
With a clear roadmap for 2025 and beyond, FPDA remains dedicated to supporting local farmers, strengthening domestic markets, and driving Papua New Guinea’s fresh produce industry towards self-sufficiency and prosperity.","Agriculture, Anticipation",Agriculture,Anticipation
FPDA strategises to develop fresh produce sector,10/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3516,"The Fresh Produce Development Agency has outlined an ambitious 2025 strategy to further develop the fresh produce sector and enhance food security in the country.

Lucrative new markets on offer for PNG coffee,08/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3503,"As coffee prices and demand increase internationally, PNG growers and exporters like Mark Munnull are getting the chance to find new markets for their quality beans.
Mark is part of a group of growers and exporters from across PNG attending the Melbourne International Coffee Expo (MICE) with support from the Australian Government.
MICE is one of the biggest shows of all things coffee in the southern hemisphere, bringing together coffee lovers with producers, processors and other industry figures from across the world.
For people like Mark, as the General Manager of Jiwaka-based coffee exporter Kosem Limited, the show represents a unique opportunity. Just over a year ago, Kosem was awarded a concessional loan from the Australia funded Revolving Fund Facility to help his family-owned business develop its export capacity.
Kosem has used the loan to help source coffee beans from some of the remotest parts of the country and provide a quality product that is uniquely Papua New Guinean.
MICE is a chance to make the most of the investment. Using contacts made at an Australian-funded visit to MICE two years ago, PNG coffee exporters entered four new markets, selling 441 tonnes of coffee in less than a year and fetching prices of up to AUD10,970 (PGK27,190) per tonne.
For the other PNG coffee exporters, attending this year’s Expo will be worth the price of admission if they can achieve the same result.
As for Mark and Kosem Limited, they hope to build on that experience to create new investment opportunities to further grow their business.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Marape reaffirmed his government’s commitment to agriculture-driven economic growth, stating that since 2022, the Government have elevated the agriculture sector by creating dedicated ministries for Coffee, Livestock, and Oil Palm.
The Oil Palm Industry Corporation (OPIC) continued its vital role in 2024, contributing to the government’s goal of doubling oil palm production to 1.3 million tonnes by 2027.
Key achievements included:
•	Smallholder Farmer Support: Expansion of replanting programmes and delivery of extension services.

•	Downstream Processing: Establishment of oil palm industrial hubs to increase value-added exports.
•	Policy Reform: NEC approval of the National Oil Palm Policy and steps toward creating the National Oil Palm Authority.
The Coffee Ministry and Coffee Industry Corporation (CIC) delivered key projects in 2024 under Medium Term Development Plan IV (MTDP IV), including:
•	Large Plantation Rehabilitation: K25 million allocated, with work commenced on seven plantations.
•	National Coffee Development Programme: Over 2.5 million seedlings planted, supporting 87 coffee grower groups and facilitating international exports to Dubai, South Korea, and Australia.
•	Infrastructure Investment: Upgrading 20km of coffee commodity roads and constructing key bridges.
•	Green Gold Card System: Digital payment platform introduced to ensure direct price support payments to farmers.
Marape praised the ministry’s efforts in policy reform, including the National Coffee Policy and the upcoming Coffee Industry Act 2024.

OPIC inks agreement with NEA for energy projects,06/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3475,"In a landmark move towards sustainable energy solutions, the National Energy Authority (NEA) and the Oil Palm Industry Corporation (OPIC) today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to implement waste-to-energy and bioenergy projects in Papua New Guinea.
This initiative aims to transform oil palm waste into a renewable energy source, contributing to PNG’s growing efforts in energy diversification and environmental sustainability.
The agreement was officially signed by OPIC General Secretary Kepson Pupita and NEA Managing Director Ronald Meketa in the presence of key government officials, industry stakeholders, and representatives from both organisations.
The signing marks a significant step forward in harnessing PNG’s agricultural waste for energy production, paving the way for innovative solutions in rural electrification and industrial energy needs.
Speaking at the signing ceremony, OPIC General Secretary Kepson Pupita highlighted the immense potential of the oil palm sector in contributing to energy generation.
“Papua New Guinea’s oil palm industry generates significant biomass waste, which, until now, has been underutilised. Through this partnership with the National Energy Authority, we are unlocking a new opportunity—turning agricultural waste into a valuable energy source. This will not only support rural electrification but also reduce environmental impact and create economic benefits for farmers,” Pupita stated.
The partnership is expected to support smallholder oil palm farmers by providing them with a sustainable outlet for their biomass waste, ensuring that agricultural byproducts contribute to the country’s energy needs instead of being discarded.
National Energy Authority Managing Director Ronald Meketa emphasised that bioenergy is a key part of PNG’s energy strategy, particularly as the country seeks to diversify its energy sources beyond fossil fuels.
“This MOU marks a crucial step in integrating bioenergy into our national energy policy. Waste-to-energy technologies can significantly improve energy access, particularly in rural communities, while also addressing waste management issues in the oil palm sector,” Meketa said.
He further outlined the government’s commitment to renewable energy, stating that bioenergy projects align with PNG’s Vision 2050 and National Energy Policy, which prioritises clean, affordable, and reliable energy for all.
Waste-to-energy and bioenergy projects are seen as critical components in reducing PNG’s reliance on imported fuels, stabilising energy costs, and improving energy security. The initiative is also expected to contribute to PNG’s climate commitments, as converting organic waste into bioenergy helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The first phase of the collaboration will involve feasibility studies, assessing the technical and economic viability of waste-to-energy projects in major oil palm-growing regions such as West New Britain, Oro, Milne Bay, and New Ireland.
Once implemented, these projects will power local communities, reduce dependence on diesel-powered generators, and support industrial growth.
Both OPIC and NEA reaffirmed their commitment to working together in developing sustainable energy solutions for PNG.
The agreement sets the stage for further investment in biofuel, biogas, and other renewable energy projects, ensuring that PNG maximises its natural and agricultural resources for national development.
With this MOU in place, PNG is taking a significant step towards a cleaner, greener, and more energy-secure future, leveraging its agricultural strengths to drive sustainable energy transformation.","Energy, Trust",Energy,Trust

Cocoa chairman furious over allocation,03/03/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3405,"Cocoa farmers in Morobe Province still float their cocoa on rubber tubes down the Buresong river, in Nawaeb district, to the coast.
From there, they then transport it on a banana boat to Lae.
The chairman of Morobe Primary Producers Cooperative Association, Reuben Yapi, painted this rather grim picture when expressing his frustration over the K2 million that was allocated to agriculture in the 2025 Morobe provincial budget.
The K723.96 million budget for this year was passed by Governor Luther Wenge and the Provincial Executive Council at the Tutumang Haus on Monday, February 24th.
In the budget, K2 million was allocated for ‘various agriculture projects’ while the Babafic Trust Fund – the body set up by the Governor to pay pastors, widows and marginalised people – is set to receive another K10 million this year. Babafic Trust, initiated in 2022, received K15 million in 2024, and K10 million in 2023.
“The K2 million allocated to agriculture in the Morobe Provincial Budget is a total disgrace,” said Yapi.
“Look at the coffee and cocoa export value from Morobe Province and try to appreciate the contribution of these commodities in terms of the increase in provincial revenue. Because we are in the city and the tax base is high, you have not seen the efforts smallholder farmers have contributed to the province.
“We still have our Watut farmers bringing large quantities of cocoa bags on dugout canoes along the Watut River and Markham River into 40-Mile, then they transport by truck into Lae.
“We have over 700 registered cooperatives in Morobe Province. Some are operating, and most are not. Morobe Primary Producers Cooperative Association is trying its best to coordinate in an extreme situation as we hardly get government support to do so.
“Our biggest challenge is logistics, as most parts of Morobe are not accessible by road and air.”
Yapi suggested that K2 million should have been allocated to each commodity, emphasising that agriculture deserves the largest chunk of the budget.","Business, Anger",Business,Anger
Rosso commends plant reopening in Lae,28/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3371,"Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso commended Majestic Seafood Corporation Limited and Minister for Fisheries Jelta Wong, on the announcement of the reopening of Majestic’s tuna processing plant in Malahang, Lae, Morobe Province.
Welcoming the news, the Deputy Prime Minister highlighted the significant economic impact of the plant’s reopening, particularly in terms of job creation and local economic growth.
“I want to thank and congratulate Majestic Seafood Corporation on this important milestone. The reopening of the tuna processing plant will create over a thousand jobs, providing vital employment opportunities while boosting the economy of Lae and Papua New Guinea,” Rosso stated.
The tuna processing facility is set to resume operations before the end of the year, restoring jobs and business opportunities lost following its closure in 2023.
He acknowledged that the plant was forced to cease operations in June 2023 due to a shortfall in fish supply and other economic challenges. He emphasized that the government has since taken strategic steps to support the industry, including adjustments to the Vessel Day Scheme (VDS) fees to encourage more fishing activity within PNG waters.
“Previously, the VDS fishing fees were not aligned to industry needs. However, with the introduction of new VDS fees, PNG’s Domestication Policy, and enhanced regulatory mechanisms, we now have better control and management of fishing activities within our waters,” Rosso explained.
Under the Domestication Policy, a minimum of 25% of all tuna caught in PNG waters must be landed in the country for processing. This policy aims to ensure a consistent supply of raw materials for local factories, create jobs, and add value to PNG’s tuna industry.
“In the past, vessels fished in PNG waters but exported all their catch. Now, due to the Domestication Policy, a minimum of 25% of the tuna must be processed locally. This is a game-changer for our tuna industry and for Papua New Guinea, as it not only strengthens our fisheries sector but also creates more employment, particularly for our women,” Rosso said.
The government has also introduced policy and legislative reforms, including subsidies on daily vessel fees for fishing vessels that supply local canneries, such as Majestic Seafood Corporation. These initiatives are designed to support domestic processing, strengthen the supply chain, and enhance the overall competitiveness of PNG’s tuna industry.
“I am pleased that the people of Lae, particularly those who were made redundant when the plant closed, will now have the opportunity to return to work,” Rosso added.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
Lihir installs new slope stability monitoring radars,27/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3355,"To improve the monitoring of response to potential geotechnical hazards, Newmont has installed advanced slope stability monitoring radars at Lihir Gold mine.
The newly installed ArcSAR radars account for vegetation and atmospheric interferences, which are vital in Lihir’s challenging environmental conditions and are designed to provide precise and reliable data.
Kaipale Pano, Lihir’s Superintendent - Geotechnical Engineering and Hydrogeology, said the radars were at the forefront of geotechnical engineering technology and would improve safety and efficiency at Lihir.
“With faster scanning times, improved resolutions and a comprehensive 360-degree scanning capability, these radars significantly improve the monitoring of Lihir’s pit slopes,” he said.
“Lihir’s ore body is situated in a volcanic crater and whilst extinct, it is still geothermally very active. The geothermal production zone, directly beneath the mining footprint, creates safety hazards unique to Lihir such as geysering in open blast holes and outbursts of hot rocks in high-pressure ground. We also receive heavy rainfall in Lihir each year.
“Having slope monitoring radars set up in Lihir helps us manage some of the risks, ultimately keeping our people and assets safe every day.”
The installation of the new radars follows the successful use of two older models, which have been in operation since 2016. While they served Lihir’s mining operation well, the availability of newer, more reliable technology prompted the upgrade, reflecting Lihir’s ongoing commitment to maintaining the highest standards of operational safety and efficiency.
Newmont reaffirmed its commitment to building PNG’s local expertise in the geotechnical engineering field and is currently refurbishing one of the decommissioned radars. It will be donated to a tertiary institution in Papua New Guinea to support students and researchers in radar monitoring training and familiarity.","Technology, Trust",Technology,Trust

Mining Bill 2025 for final review,26/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3336,"For 33 years, stakeholders in the PNG Mining industry have been operating on the legislation which is the Mining Act 1992, and 15 years of consultation for the development of the Mining Bill 2025.
The Mining Bill 2025 was launched on Tuesday, February 25th, which also marked the final leg of all feedback before its introduction to the National Parliament for enactment.
Minister for Mining, Wake Goi, said 15 years was enough and it is time to go to Parliament and act on it. He said that all must contribute to the legislation, everyone pleased with it and analysed it well before it headed into parliament.
“Before we proceed to Parliament, we are giving all stakeholders, the mining industry, landowners, and the public, an opportunity to review the draft mining bill, 2025, and provide you feedback. This is an essential step in ensuring that the law is robust, transparent and reflects the interest of all Papua New Guineans, the industry, and all stakeholders and the landowners so that we will carefully consider every comment and suggestion before we finalize.”
The Mineral Resources Authority encouraged stakeholders and those reviewing to have an open mind about the new bill - like the mechanical part of the business, and introduction to some form of social license fee in the law so mining projects can look after community development agendas.
“When it comes to changing any laws there must be good grounds for changing laws. We have been operating on this legislation for 33 years and I think most of what's in the Mining Act 1992 has been inherited before the independence of this country and we are still using the same framework.”
Minister Goi shared that the new bill has new concepts that will not only ensure better regulations of the mining sector but will also guarantee that Papua New Guinea secures every resource.

PM Marape welcomes CPOPC delegates,20/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3266,"The Government has welcomed Papua New Guinea’s official membership in the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC), marking a milestone for the nation’s oil palm industry.
PNG joins Indonesia, Malaysia, and Honduras as the fourth member of the global palm oil organisation, strengthening the country’s position in international trade and sustainability advocacy.
Speaking at a high-level meeting attended by CPOPC Secretary-General Dr Rizal Affandi Lukman, Deputy Secretary-General Datuk Nageeb Wahab, PNG’s Oil Palm Minister Francis Maneke, Indonesian Ambassador His Excellency Andriana Supandy, Agriculture Secretary Dr Sergie Bang, and Oil Palm Industry Corporation General Secretary Kepson Pupita, Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed PNG’s commitment to responsible and sustainable palm oil production.
Marape emphasised PNG’s active role in past CPOPC discussions, highlighting the importance of joining as a full member.
“This is a significant moment for our country. We appreciate Indonesia and Malaysia for embracing PNG into the CPOPC family. Together, we can strengthen our advocacy and ensure that the global palm oil market remains fair and sustainable,” he stated.
He noted that PNG has immense growth potential, highlighting that over one million hectares of grassland can be utilised for palm oil cultivation.
“As a major forest nation, we will ensure that our palm oil production meets international sustainability standards and that we counter any misleading narratives about deforestation,” he said.
The Prime Minister assured stakeholders that PNG is committed to enhancing investment opportunities and improving market access.
“We must work together to ensure PNG’s palm oil meets the requirements of international markets, including compliance with European Union regulations. Our industry must align with global standards while also benefiting from the economic opportunities that palm oil provides,” he said.
He also highlighted PNG’s ambition to develop downstream processing and biofuel production, citing Indonesia’s progress in palm oil-based renewable energy.
“We must explore palm oil as a fuel alternative, as Indonesia has done successfully. This will not only boost our economy but also position us as a key player in the green energy sector,” he stated.
CPOPC Secretary-General Dr Rizal Affandi Lukman welcomed PNG’s membership, stating, “Papua New Guinea’s entry into CPOPC strengthens our collective advocacy for fair trade and sustainable palm oil production. PNG’s involvement will bring significant contributions to the industry, particularly in expanding market access and reinforcing sustainable practices.”
Dr Lukman also emphasised that PNG’s inclusion in CPOPC aligns with global efforts to address regulatory challenges such as European Union deforestation compliance.
“We have been engaging with European stakeholders to ensure that regulatory frameworks recognise sustainable palm oil production. PNG’s inclusion allows us to strengthen these discussions and present a united front,” he added.
Marape reaffirmed PNG’s commitment to strengthening advocacy efforts alongside Indonesia and Malaysia.
“We must stand together to promote fair trade policies and counter any negative narratives surrounding palm oil. As major forest nations, we have the responsibility to present our case and showcase that we are sustainable producers,” he said.
Additionally, he reiterated the government’s intention to expand palm oil into biofuel production.
“Palm oil is more than just an edible oil; it is a critical resource for the future of green energy. We need to ensure that we fully maximise its potential,” he said.
Recognising industry challenges such as high operational costs and investment hurdles, the Prime Minister reassured investors that PNG is taking steps to improve the business environment.
“We are working on land mobilisation programmes and tax incentives to make PNG a more attractive investment destination.”
He also highlighted the government’s K100 million annual allocation for land acquisition and infrastructure support, ensuring long-term growth in the sector.
“We are putting systems in place to encourage sustainable industry expansion and create more opportunities for our people,” the Prime Minister stated.
He proposed hosting a CPOPC Heads of Government Meeting, bringing together leaders from member nations to discuss trade, sustainability, and global market strategies.
“We are not alone in this industry. Through collaboration with Indonesia, Malaysia, and other producers, we can build a more equitable and sustainable palm oil market.
“We look forward to strengthening our role in CPOPC and working together for the benefit of all palm oil-producing nations.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
New tuna plan to strengthen sector,19/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3242,"The government is confident that additional investments, including new foreign direct investments, will flow into Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) tuna industry with the launch of the Tuna Domestication Strategy and an updated National Tuna Fisheries Management Plan, expected in the first half of this year, and will further strengthen the sustainable management and development of the tuna fisheries sector.
Fisheries minister Jelta Wong highlighted that the government is committed to supporting the sustainable growth of the fisheries sector.
“We are not merely making commitments; we are implementing policies that drive real change. To further enhance the industry, we are establishing a sector-based State-Owned Enterprise, Fisheries Capital Limited (FCL). Once approved by Parliament, this SOE will facilitate joint ventures, address industry inefficiencies, and make strategic investments along the tuna value chain to improve the overall business environment.”
The establishment of the SOE is one of six strategic areas under NFA’s plan to change the landscape of PNG’s fisheries sector to be investor ready.
Managing Director of the authority responsible for managing and developing the fisheries sector, National Fisheries Authority (NFA), Justin Ilakini, highlighted that this will strengthen private sector partnership. The corporate establishment will be launched in March and will focus on non-fisheries regulated activities in the interim while awaiting legislative reforms, that is the Fisheries Capital Authorization Bill to be given legal clearance.
“For the first time, NFA will not be pressured to maximize revenue, because fisheries management act was never legislated for us to maximize revenue. We were legislated to manage the resources.”
Ilakini says when the government asked all economic sectors to contribute to a K200 billion economy by 2030, NFA reflected at the legislation governing their operations and realized the organization could not pursue that.
“We need structural change; we need legislative change in order for us to contribute towards a K200 billion economy by 2030. Hence the establishment of this sectoral SOE. That sectoral SOE, it’s sole responsibility is to maximize value for the state.”
Ilakini updates that an appropriation bill has already been prepared, by next month (March) it will be cleared for cabinet and then parliament.
“That will change the way we have been doing business for the last 30 years.”
Ilakini emphasized that under this government’s leadership, NFA to been able to go beyond the K600 million mark in terms of generating revenue from fisheries resources.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Firms to be liable for pavement damages,19/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3239,"Companies will soon be liable for damages to roads caused by their heavy vehicles.
This is why the new PNG Road Fund office in Nadzab, Morobe Province, is “strategic”, said the board director and Works Secretary, Gibson Olemba.
The Nadzab office, which was opened on Friday, February 14th, will focus on the three national highways; the Ramu Highway, the Highlands Highway and the Trans-National Highway that will connect Morobe to the National Capital District.
“This office is strategic,” Olemba told Lae media.
“We can now establish weighbridges as part of our road maintenance efforts to maintain the road network.
“Most of the pavements are being damaged by heavy vehicles, overloading. Pavements are designed for 44 tonnes up to a 20-year design life. So that means that if we are overloaded, we are reducing the years of pavement life.
“That means that we have to hold accountable business houses that are causing damage to the road. That is why the PNG Road Fund is very important and the role that the Road Traffic Authority plays is crucial because they are the regulators of road traffic across the network.
“They regulate traffic and public safety so in terms of regulations, they provide the fees back to the Road Fund to fund and we (Works) implement those fees they collect from the Road Fund to maintain our road networks.”
Olemba clarified that after the Connect PNG program, the PNG Road Fund will be responsible for the sustainability of the road networks.
“Once we build roads through the Connect PNG capital funding, the maintenance funds will come to the Road Fund to support us to maintain the network so that we have a road network that is safe and reliable for businesses and the public to use.”
Chairman and Secretary for Finance, Samuel Penias, said one weighbridge will be installed at Nadzab to service the Nadzab and Ramu Highway while another will be at Bulolo, to service the Wau-Bulolo Highway and connecting the Trans-National Highway.
Also, under the Asian Development Bank’s Sustainable Highlands Highway Investment Program (SHIPP), another two weighbridges will be built; one at Nadzab and another in Goroka or Mt Hagen.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

ENBPG endorses 2025 budget,17/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3213,"The East New Britain Provincial Government last week endorsed its 2025 Provincial Budget of K566,705,482.
The budget comprises mainly development funds worth over K308 million (54 percent) while recurrent is valued at almost K258 million.
The provincial headquarters holds over K290m, district development authorities cater for about K240m while LLGs comprise just over K36m.
Provincial Member, Michael Marum, presented the budget appropriation Bill at a special Provincial Assembly, held in Kokopo on February 14th, which received full approval from the house.
ENB Provincial Administrator, Levi Mano, said they anticipate issues with the implementation of the budget.
This year's budget is slightly higher (additional of K30m) than last year’s money plan, and again includes unspent funds from the previous years.
“From the report that I was given, last year we (ENBPA) had achieved a 53 percent implementation rate of the 2024 budget. This is an improvement compared to previous years, but it is still not enough,” Mano stated.
He said the ENBPG and its administration have made some re-arrangement while seeking outside assistance on infrastructure development and sustainability, given the absence of the Gazelle Restoration Authority (GRA).
As a key infrastructure project listed in this year’s budget, the civic centre will be second priority, as Parliament House takes precedence.
“Our public service is currently under long term agreements with property owners so we will shift our focus to setting up the government seat first. Work has progressed on site at Vunabakut in Kokopo, and by the end of this year, we should have some progress,” Mano outlined.
Currently, the ENBPA spends over K5m in rental for the public service.
Commenting on the budget, Gazelle MP and National Minister for Fisheries, Jelta Wong, requested more assistance to wards in the acquittal of funds.
Speaking on unused funds from former years, Minister Wong said those funds should be used in areas that need funding, like education, health and agriculture.
Likewise, Pomio MP and National Health Minister, Elias Kapavore, called for a more robust and fine tuned monitoring and evaluation arrangement, so to improve the province's accounting system.
Rabaul MP, Dr. Allan Marat, emphasised on the need for consultation between senior public servants and political heads, especially about projects and programs that would be captured in the budget.
The Member for Kokopo, Ereman ToBaining Junior, echoed a call by the Pomio MP for the responsible sector in the ENBPA to fast-track outstanding land matters.
Meanwhile, Kokopo City Mayor, Phillip Tale, called for more support to build ward community halls for the over 300 wards of East New Britain, to strengthen governance at the ward level.
Governor Marum said he has taken note of all comments made and assured the provincial government’s support towards planned projects and programs in the districts.
The 2025 approved provincial budget focuses on infrastructure development with major projects and programs like district roads, bridges and an airstrip in Pomio District.
This also includes the Provincial Government House and Civic Centre, as well as infrastructure for the education and health sectors.
Community empowerment programs initiated last year will be progressed under the Community Development Division and other relevant sectors of the ENBPA.","Government, Anticipation",Government,Anticipation
Kabiufa reopens coffee factory,16/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3206,"With coffee being one of Papua New Guinea’s most valuable agricultural exports, the need for a factory is important in places where coffee grows abundantly, like Kabiufa in Eastern Highlands Province.
On Friday, February 14th, the Minister for Coffee, William Bando marked a historic milestone in Papua New Guinea’s coffee industry by reopening Anego Coffee Factory in Kabiufa, Goroka, after 15 years of inactivity.
This signifies a new era of growth, empowerment, and investment in PNG’s coffee sector.
Minister Bando reaffirmed the Marape-Rosso Government’s vision of making the country a leading global coffee producer through investment, innovation, and farmer empowerment.
“The future of PNG coffee is bright, and today, we take one bold step forward. This is just the beginning of a thriving, self-sustaining coffee industry that will create jobs, empower communities, and boost our economy,” Minister Bando said.
The revival of Anego Coffee Factory was made possible through the Coffee Industry Corporation Ltd (CICL) – PNG Agriculture Commercialization and Diversification (PACD) Project 3.2 Matching Grant Component, which contributed K360,000, with Anego providing K72,000, bringing the total investment to K432,000.
This funding has restored the factory and facilitated the installation of a brand new 200 Kva genset, ensuring uninterrupted processing and greater efficiency for large-scale coffee production.
At the opening Minister Bando also presented Anego Coffee Factory with a processing license and provided K100,000 to assist in its operations, further solidifying the National Government’s commitment to strengthening local coffee production and export capacity.
“We are happy to give you this processing license today,” said Minister Bando.
“This is the start of something bigger. Our government is committed to empowering coffee processors and farmers, ensuring PNG’s coffee industry thrives on both local and global markets.”
The government remains committed to fostering growth in the coffee sector, ensuring more farmers and processors have the resources and support needed to succeed.
“By investing in coffee processing, we are ensuring that our hardworking farmers benefit directly from the industry’s success, while also positioning PNG coffee as a competitive player in the global market.”
Anego Managing Director, Albert Wamiri, expressed appreciation for the government’s commitment, acknowledging the significant impact this funding will have on local coffee farmers and processors.
“This contribution is a great help to us. With this support, we are now in a stronger position to expand, process more coffee, and contribute to the economy.”","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
"MVF project, a success in PNG",16/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3204,"The Market for Village Farmers (MVF) project or Maket Bilong Vilis Fama is a project jointly funded by the Government of Papua New Guinea (GoPNG) and the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD).
As its name suggests, this project is an investment for improved livelihoods of farming households, aimed at providing market access for rural-based farmers, hence, facilitating their transition from subsistence farming activities to market-oriented production and farming as a business.
It is a first-of-its-kind direct government investment in the horticulture industry which 80 percent of the economically active population is reliant on, which is predominantly subsistence-level rather than commercial agriculture.
Recently, MVF has assisted farmers in the Highlands region, especially in Western Highlands, Simbu, Eastern Highlands, and others.
Fresh Produce Development Agency Chief Executive Officer, Mark Worinu said the MVF project intervention is the first-ever investment initiative taken by the government to boost the horticulture industry which sustains over 80 percent of the economically active population in the country.
“The project is perfectly complementing the programs of the Fresh Produce Development Agency (FPDA) in developing the horticulture and fresh produce sub-sector. It is impacting the lives of the people by bringing market access closer to the people, building improved value chains, preventing post-harvest loss, and changing the mindset of the people to take farming as a business.”
He added that the bigger picture is to help reduce imports of certain crops that can be grown within the country such as potato, and bulb onion, among others.
MVF project manager, Joe Koima has advised the recipient farmers to wisely utilize the farm inputs distributed to improve their households.
“This project is funded through a loan facility obtained by the Government of Papua New Guinea.  The loan will be repaid by the taxpayers of this country, therefore, you farmers in the targeted provinces are privileged to receive such grants. Make good use of the benefits and produce success stories for the government as a reward for the good faith shown in you.”
MVF project coordinator for Simbu, David Kaupa praised the government for undertaking a deliberate investment intervention that is targeting a sector where the vast majority of the country’s rural population relies on.
“Chimbu is going miles because of the MVF project. MVF project is injecting millions of kina directly into the pockets of the hardworking rural farmers who have been struggling for so long. I thank the Marape-Rosso government for making the right decision.”
Paula Toman, lead partner of Gawai Women’s Enterprise in Nondugl district, Jiwaka pointed out that poor road conditions have been an obstacle faced by the farmers.
“Most times, our produce goes to waste because of bad road networks which affects the transportation of the produce from Nondugl to Banz. Demand is there but the problem is road and transportation. If there is a component for infrastructure that can cater to those needs at a bigger scope can capture our dilemma.”
Lead partner, Jim Kuk of Paks Supplies Ltd, based at Kindeng in Jiwaka, thanked IFAD, DAL, GoPNG and FPDA for undertaking a project that is transforming the lives of the rural majority who cultivate the land and engaging in the fresh produce sector.
“Through the MVF project, I have received a chiller truck which is improving the quality of produce. The freshness of the vegetables that are harvested by the farmers is maintained from the farm gates to the top-end markets. I applaud the government for this project.”
Toppy Sundu, a farmer from Gembogl district hailed the MVF project intervention for targeting the underprivileged members of the community especially orphans, widows, drug addicts, and others by improving their lives.
Mount Wilhelm Organic Farmers Cooperative Society chairman and lead partner Peter Poka from Gembogl said the MVF project has accelerated the farming intentions of the people. “Now that the project life is extended to 2026, production will increase and people will see increased returns which will increase the standard of living for the people.”
Paul Koim, lead farmer under Paks Supplies Ltd in Mt. Hagen, Western Highlands said through the project intervention support, he has increased his farm operations, and earned increased income which he used to build permanent houses for his family.
Rita Mondia, a farmer under Kupo Range Fresh Produce, based in Kundiawa, thanked the government for its investment in the horticulture industry through the MVF project which is injecting cash into the pockets of rural village farmers.","Agriculture, Trust",Agriculture,Trust
Kutubu LOs in a Deadlock Over Ministerial Determination,15/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3202,"Landowners of Kutubu PDL 2 in Southern Highlands Province are at loggerheads over the implementation of a 2022 Ministerial Determination that saw a change in the benefit sharing structure.
Landowners have grouped into two factions – one faction led by the Foe and Namo Aporo Association chairs, Johnny Yawari and John Kapi Natto and another faction, led by Mark Sakai and Norman Ba’abi.
The ministerial determination is a result of a Landowner Benefit Identification (LOB-ID) exercise carried out in 2013 to confirm and identify clans in each PDL, pipeline segment and liquefaction plant site project corridors of LNG.
All data obtained from this exercise were calibrated and submitted to the Petroleum Minister for determination. When Kerenga Kua was Petroleum Minister under the Marape government in 2022, he finally made the ministerial determination, guided by the Oil and Gas Act 1998.
Agreement for Kutubu Oil Project
The Agreement for Kutubu Oil Project under which benefits have been shared in the last 30 years was done before the Oil and Gas Act 1998 came into place.
In the old benefit sharing structure, the Southern Highlands Provincial Government receives 70 per cent of the royalty while the landowners comprising the Foe and Fasu people receive 30 per cent.
This 30 per cent is divided by the landowners with the Fasu people receiving 90 per cent through the Namo Aporo Association while the Foe people receive 10 per cent through the Foe Landowners Association.
This structure does not identify and give recognition to the affected and impacted landowners – these are clans whose land on which the Dedicated Project Facilities of Santos sits on and operates in. Instead the benefits flow through the two umbrella associations which are Foe and Namo Aporo. These associations are made up of ILGs. The Foe Association has 139 ILGs while Namo Aporo has 117 ILGs.
Land demarcation
Interestingly, most if not all the Dedicated Project Facilities of Santos sit on land that’s owned by the Fasu clans who come under the Namo Aporo Landowners Association.
Twelve blocks are in the Kutubu PDL 2 project and most of the Foe clans do not sit within these 12 blocks except for the Yagabos clan, who sits within block 2152.
Other Foe clans that are directly impacted and affected by the project are two clans which have part of their land within block 2225 and one clan which has part of its land within block 2079.
The benefit-sharing structure reflects this, with the Foe people receiving 10 percent and the Fasu receiving 90 percent through their respective LO associations.
Ministerial Determination 2022
Under the new Ministerial Determination of 2022, clans were identified separately and classified according to the projects impact on their land and invoking Section 169 and S170 of the Oil and Gas Act, only those clans impacted and affected by the project will be recipients of the benefits and not those outside the 12 blocks.
This means not all ILGs that form the associations will benefit equally as used to. Those ILGs that are outside the 12 blocks will now only receive a portion of the benefits.
The high level benefit split under the new structure will be as follows:
Fasu – 20 per cent to clans outside the block and 80 per cent to clans within the block.
Foe – 30 per cent to clans outside the blocks and 70 per cent to clans within the blocks.
The Ministerial Determination does not recognize the associations anymore. If benefits are to be shared under this new structure, it will go directly to the impacted and affected clans, and not the two associations.
This has now prompted the associations to call for the government to revoke the Ministerial Determination.
But according to the Oil and Gas Act, “a Ministerial Determination made pursuant to the section shall not be reviewable before court unless an application for review is made within 28 days of the ministerial determination.”
The Yawari Nato Faction Gives Government 14 days to revoke Ministerial Determination
When the Ministerial Determination is finally executed, many ILGs and clans are likely to be impacted. Seeing this coming, the association chairs of Foe and Namo Aporo have called on the government to revoke the ministerial determination and revert to the old Kutubu Oil Agreement.
They claim that the staff of the Department of Petroleum conspired with individuals with vested interest and changed the benefit sharing structure and also added two more clans to the Foe region.
They are also arguing that the old structure ensured equal distribution of benefits, regardless of whether the clans and ILGs were within the 12 blocks or not.
The new one only identifies clans and ILGs that sit within the 12 blocks as genuine landowners and are qualified to receive the benefits.
Chairman of Namo Aporo Association Inc.
John Kapi Natto said the land owners were not consulted on the recent Ministerial Determination which led to this upsetting decision. He said instead of adding equity to the landowner, as any people's government would do, the government, under the leadership of Prime Minister James Marape, is trying to split their shares. He urged the government to leave the agreement as it has been for over 30-years.
Kapi Natto said ""I urge the government, don't interfere with the benefits of the people. The benefits have stayed for the last 37-years, leave it as it is.”
Kapi Natto added that the Landowners will not go to court should the government persist.
But this faction took the matter to the national Court and lost the case. They appealed the matter at the Supreme Court but also lost and all parties were ordered by the court to return home and register their ILGs as all ILG registrations had expired.
Chairman of the Foe Association Inc. supported the Namo Aporo Association Inc and other Incorporated Land Groups in the course demanding Prime Minister James Marape and his Petroleum Minister, Jimmy Maladina to revoke the Ministerial Determination.
Yawari said, his Foe people are custodians to the land boundaries that hosts both the old Oil project and the new PNG LNG project in Kutubu PDL 2. The State must protect the Landowner entitlements and ensure their fair share of royalty and equity as per the initial Kutubu Oil Agreement with then Prime Minister Sir Rabbie Namaliu in 1992.
Yawari added, all the previous governments under the Prime Ministership of Sir Rabbie Namaliu, Sir Julius Chan, Sir Michael Somare and other Prime Ministers have always respected the PDL 2 benefit sharing arrangement between the Kutubu people and the State…
Yawari further said former Petroleum Minister Kerenga Kua, an appointee of the current Marape-Rosso Government, effected the Ministerial Determination without proper consultation and involvement of Kutubu leaders and demanded the Prime Minister James Marape and his government to intervene immediately in revoking the misguided Ministerial Determination without delay and maintain the status quo.
“In my capacity as the Chairman of Foe Association and on behalf of my people, I give the Prime Minister and his Government 14-Days to revoke the Ministerial Determination forthwith and revert back to the initial status quo as per the Kutubu Oil Agreement in 1992 and 1996,” said Yawari.
He concluded that if the State fails to comply with the 14-day ultimatum, which began on Monday, February 10, the Kutubu people will unite to disrupt mining operations
The Sakai Ba’abi faction assure developers of project security
On the other hand, the landowner faction led by Mark Sakai and Norman Ba’abi have given their undertaking to the project developers that the project is safe and dismissed the threats issued by the other faction.
Mark Sakai who is from the Fasu tribe has questioned the association chairs of Foe and Fasu on who they represent, as he claims the associations are now defunct following the expiry of the registration of all the ILGs that comprise the associations in 2017.
The grace period given to fix these ILGs was 2022 but when this grace period also expired, all bank accounts for the ILGs were closed. This has led to a stop in the flow of benefits too.
Sakai says the court gave clear orders for landowners to return home and register the ILGs and to date, no action has been taken despite MRDC making K4.7 million available in 2023 to carry out this exercise.
And he further explains the Ministerial Determination that identified the impacted and affected landowners of Kutubu. He says the results are there and speak for themselves who the true landowners are, saying “Associations don’t own land, leaders don’t own land, clans do.” He therefore says only those clans identified to be within the 12 blocks are the impacted and affected clans and questioned the Foe and Namo Aporo leaders to clearly state which block their clan sits in.
He again stressed that all the Dedicated Project Facilities of Santos does not sit on their land and further questioned which facility they will shut down under the 14-day ultimatum.
Sakai said he will be on the ground when the 14-day ultimatum expires and assured project developers of the project’s safety.
He said the ministerial determination is a result of a long fight that took 30 years to identify the real landowners of the project and called for its implementation.
Sakai Kei is from the Yaferaka clan and they own the land on which the Ridge Camp is situated. He assured Santos, Exxon Mobil and Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited of his clan’s support.
He also reminded the Chairman of PRK, John Kapi Natto not to issue threats as he is a partner in the project, with business interests there.
Norman Ba’abi representing the Foe people backed the arguments by Sakai and Kei and admitted that his people (Foe) don’t host any of Santos’ essential facilities – all facilities are on Fasu land and called on the Foe people to respect this fact.
All leaders in this faction highlighted that the Kutubu Project Agreement was done at the time when they did not have many educated men to represent them at the table and was hijacked by a few elites of Kutubu at that time.

Mahogany Finance Accelerates Vehicle Ownership,14/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3188,"Mahogany Finance is redefining vehicle financing in Papua New Guinea through its collaboration with 2 Fast Motors, offering rapid loan approvals and a seamless customer experience.
CEO Terry Hall highlights that the company’s main competitive edge is its ability to process vehicle loan applications swiftly. Unlike conventional lenders, Mahogany Finance provides loan decisions within 48 hours, ensuring clients do not endure long waiting periods.
“As soon as we receive a referral from 2 Fast Motors, we immediately engage with the customer. We discuss their needs, outline the necessary requirements in a single email, and ensure full transparency in the process,” Hall said.
One of the standout features of Mahogany Finance’s approach is its commitment to efficiency. The company’s internal systems are designed to eliminate back-and-forth document requests, ensuring that once all requirements are met, approval follows quickly. This means that customers can drive away with their new vehicles in as little as five to six working days.
Transparency and communication are central to Mahogany Finance’s operations. Sales representatives at 2 Fast Motors are kept informed at every stage of the loan process, ensuring a smooth experience for customers.
“Our goal is to be proactive, not reactive. We don’t leave customers waiting. If we haven’t heard from them after a few days, we reach out to see how we can help,” Hall explained.
Beyond vehicle financing, Mahogany Finance also supports small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by providing guidance on alternative financing solutions, such as the government’s credit guarantee scheme.
Hall believes that offering advice, even to those who may not immediately become clients, fosters long-term business relationships.
Staff development is another key focus for Mahogany Finance. The company invests in training programs to ensure that all employees possess strong product knowledge and customer service skills. Internal career growth is encouraged, with employees progressing into more senior roles over time.
With a strong emphasis on customer service, transparency, and efficiency, Mahogany Finance’s partnership with 2 Fast Motors is streamlining the vehicle financing process and making car ownership more accessible.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Rigo farmers trained to plant rice,13/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3174,"Rice is a staple food in Papua New Guinea, however most rice consumed are imported. A new Association called the Walk the Talk Association is working together with National Agriculture Research Institute of PNG and the Taiwan Technical Mission to train farmers to plant rice.
Fifteen Rigo District farmers are currently in a 3-day rice planting training which began earlier this week.
“So, we will start with the farmland selection development, then to nursery, transplanting and to grow rice in their homeland. We plan for them to come monthly to follow up on their growth of rice because from nursery to harvest it takes 5 months, after training they can go back and practice what they learnt from here.”
President for Walk the Talk Association, Vera Raga, emphasized the importance of bringing revenue back to the country, reducing imports, global food security and alleviating poverty.
“The import bill for rice is K1 billion, rice is a staple diet but unfortunately we don’t grow it much. The government’s Medium-Term Development Plan is to make sure there is import substitution and this is the start at the base level. We are pragmatic that is why we want to walk the talk.
“Rice is also very expensive, unless you grow it so that is the emphasis and it is wonder why we have not grown it yet since Independence. We are blessed with land and labour and at some point, we should have planted rice.”
This initiative is for free and rice farmers will be certified, and progress into training other farmers to grow rice in the district. The program is long-term and will have other interested farmers join.
Raga shared that the training is however in its pilot stage and will branch other to other farmers in other districts if they’re interested.","Agriculture, Anticipation",Agriculture,Anticipation
PNG Anticipates Strong Year for Agriculture Exporters,07/02/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/3107,"Papua New Guinea is expecting another strong year for its agriculture exporters, with global coffee prices hitting a 50-year high just two months ago.
Kina Bank CEO and Managing Director Ivan Vidovich shared this positive outlook at the 2025 Back to Business Breakfast in Port Moresby on Tuesday, February 4, 2025.
“While agriculture is expected to perform well, international hotspots like the Middle East and Ukraine will continue to disrupt global supply chains. These challenges highlight the fragility of global supply networks, and PNG is affected by this,” Vidovich said.
He added that PNG can be protected from external risks with sensible policies and close collaboration between the Government and the private sector.
“We enter 2025 with uncertainty in the global economy and in the geopolitical landscape,” Vidovich said.
“The global economy continues to navigate uncertainties, with a second Trump Presidential term, China’s slowing growth, and geopolitical hotspots potentially sparking commodity price volatility.
He added that the PNG Kina-US Dollar interbank rate will continue to adjust downwards through the Bank of PNG’s instituted ‘crawling peg’ regime.
“In 2024, the BPNG provided intervention into the market on a regular basis which helped authorised foreign exchange dealers to clear import orders in a timely manner. We observed that through the second half of 2024, delays for import orders reduced on average from months to weeks.”
He added that as a result of the continued re-adjustment of the PNG Kina, PNG’s agriculture exporters can expect another strong year.
“Global Coffee prices hit a 50-year high just two months ago. 2024 was a strong year for cocoa growers in PNG. Price increases are projected to be double digits in the coming year. Gold prices are also set for another solid year trading above US$2,000 an ounce, as geopolitical tensions and uncertainty continue to keep gold prices elevated,” Vidovich added.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Vidovich also expressed gratitude to Kina Bank’s outgoing CEO and Managing Director, Greg Pawson, whose leadership significantly expanded Kina’s digital footprint across the country.

Water cress farming using traditional irrigation method,29/01/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2999,"In 2015, a devastating flood washed away coffee trees in Bugweb village in the Rural Buang LLG of Bulolo district.  Coffee is one of their main source of income. The locals responded by farming water cress, a fast way of making good income to revive and sustain their livelihoods.
Farming of water cress here is done by building low stone walls in a plot-like style and skilfully diverting water into their water cress plots.
Bugweb’s stone-wall water cress farming and irrigation was discovered by a team comprising of officers from the National Agriculture Research Institute (NARI) and University of Goroka’s Centre for Social and Creative Media while working on an ACIAR-funded, Climate Smart Agriculture Project. The project focused on documenting a video about traditional irrigation systems with farmers on taro and water cress in Patep 2 village, across the bordering mountain range.
The Climate Smart Agriculture project is fully supported by ACIAR with the main objective, of finding meaningful ways to enable vulnerable communities become resilient and improves agricultural production from negative effect of climate change.
This traditional style of irrigation is a display of resilience to continue surviving by locals in Bugweb towards the negative effect of climate change like flooding.
Farming water cress can fetch between K150 to K300 to sustain their living expenses from school fees, uniforms, church work, basic household needs and cultural responsibilities.
Ward 6 Councilor of Bugweb, William Sale expressed that 99 households participate in this water cress farming, and involves males and females from harvesting, sorting, bundling and packing. Each bundle of water cress is sold from K1 to K1.50.
Apart from water cress, orange, when in season, provides additional income including dried seeds of pumpkin, amaranth (aupa), cucumber, and corn.
The community of Bugweb expressed that farming water cress is a fast way of earning income and by sharing their story, will enable other areas with similar resources to be resilient and sustainable during natural disasters.
Patep 2 village is another area that uses traditional irrigation since the 1950s to grow taro and water cress. If you happen to come across a farmer who is selling fresh water cress at the Lae Main Market, be sure to ask where it was farmed.
A short video featuring water cress farming in Bugweb will be developed along and later released with other farmer videos by NARI and UoG’s CSCM over the life of the CSA project.
The CSA project ends in March, 2025.","Agriculture, Joy",Agriculture,Joy

OTML Exceeds Targets,27/01/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2980,"Ok Tedi Mining Limited (OTML) has once again surpassed its annual sediment dredging and rehabilitation targets for its Bige Operations, marking the fifth consecutive year of achievement.
In 2024, the team dredged 10.75 million cubic meters (Mm³) of river sediments, exceeding the target of 10 Mm³, and rehabilitated 35.21 hectares (ha) of sand stockpiles, surpassing the goal of 30 ha.
The Bige Operations Team plays a critical role in managing sediment loads in the Ok Tedi and Fly River systems, preventing adverse environmental and social impacts.
OTML's Manager of Bige Operations, Naimen Kepan, emphasized the importance of these achievements, stating, “Meeting these targets demonstrates our commitment to responsible mining and aligns with the Ok Tedi Environment Management Act (OTEMA). It supports sustainable growth, minimizes environmental impacts, and benefits local communities.”
Located 106 kilometres from the Ok Tedi Mine, the Bige dredging operation removes approximately 85 percent of sediment passing through the dredge slot annually, preventing downstream travel. The dredged materials are stored in engineered stockpiles on the East and West Banks of the Ok Tedi River and rehabilitated with vegetation cover to restore the environment.
Since 1998, OTML has dredged approximately 438 million tonnes of sand at an annual cost of K233,100,000. This initiative has significantly reduced riverbed aggradation and its associated environmental effects, such as dieback.
Rehabilitation efforts are guided by OTML’s Mine Area Rehabilitation Plan and Closure Plan, bringing the company closer to restoring the East Bank stockpile and ensuring a sustainable environment post-mine closure.
These achievements reaffirm OTML’s dedication to environmental sustainability, operational excellence, and community well-being, showcasing its role as a leader in responsible resource management.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

KPPA takes legal action to repossess business arm,15/01/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2853,"Konedobu Petroleum Park Authority (KPPA) will institute legal proceedings to take back its subsidiary, Petroleum Park Holdings Limited from the hands of current directors and shareholders.
Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru in announcing this said the authority has resorted to this action because there is no other option left to repossess this company.
""From legal advice received, there is no option available under Konebada Petroleum Park Authority Act 2008 (as amended), the Companies Act 1997, and the Constitution of PPHL for KPPA to take back its subsidiary, PPHL. Hence, Court is the only option available to recover PPHL from the hands of those so-called Directors and Shareholders. Therefore, KPPA will institute legal proceedings and I, as the Minister responsible, have given instructions to the KPPA Board chaired by Mr. Martin Kombri to take that action immediately,"" said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru recently provided updates on the Petroleum Park Holdings Limited, a subsidiary company of Konebada Petroleum Park Authority.
Pursuant to Sections 5 and 8 of the Konebada Petroleum Park Authority Act 2008 (as amended), a company called ""Petroleum Park Holdings Limited"" (PPHL) was incorporated under the Companies Act 1997 by Konebada Petroleum Park Authority (KPPA).
Minister Maru said, “Under normal arrangement, KPPA will be the sole owner of PPHL and those appointed to hold shares in PPHL will hold them in trust for and on behalf of KPPA pursuant to a Trust Deed. However, what had happened was that under the reign of Mr. Donald Valu, as the then Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of KPPA, himself and Mr. Joel Oli were appointed as inaugural Directors and Shareholders of PPHL. Sometimes later on, Mr. Samuel Pepena was appointed as a Director and Shareholder after Mr. Oli was removed. The current Directors and Shareholders of PPHL are Mr. Valu and Mr. Pepena.”
The Minister’s office states that the company documents obtained from the Investment Promotion Authority revealed that:
1.	There is no Trust Deed in place to give the legal mandate to Donald Valu and Samuel Pepena to hold the shares of PPHL in trust for KPPA.
2.	Donald Valu and Samuel Pepena hold the shares in PPHL as owners and not in trust for KPPA.
3.	There is a Constitution of PPHL which was drafted in a manner that excludes or removes the powers and control of KPPA over PPHL and says that KPPA ""does not have any power, or right automatic or otherwise to direct, control, meddle or interfere in the conduct of
4.	The business affairs of PPHL, including the removing or appointing directors or shareholders of PPHL, altering the Constitution, and deal with assets and undertakings of PPHL or otherwise exert any control or external management of PPHL."" (Clause 3.3 (a) of the Constitution of PPHL).
Minister Maru further explains that, “The Companies Act 1997 authorizes for a company to have a constitution and that constitution governs the administration and operations of that company. Hence, PPHL has a constitution but that constitution insulates and isolates the current Directors and Shareholders from being subjected to supervision and control from its owner, KPPA.”
That has now left KPPA with no option but to go to court to recover its business arm.","Business, Anger",Business,Anger

PNG secures milestone membership,05/01/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2760,"Papua New Guinea has achieved a historic milestone by securing membership in the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC), formalised on 30th December 2024. This membership places PNG alongside palm oil giants Malaysia, Indonesia, and Honduras, aligning the nation with global leaders in sustainable palm oil production.
Member for Alotau and Shadow Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government and National Fisheries, Ricky Morris, has praised the achievement, highlighting its transformative potential for the nation’s agricultural sector and economy.
“Palm oil is PNG’s highest agricultural revenue earner, contributing an impressive USD 1.03 billion in exports in 2022, making it our third-largest export commodity and placing us among the top five palm oil exporters globally. It is gratifying to see our nation finally join CPOPC, a council that will allow us to strengthen our position in the global market, collaborate with international leaders, and address challenges in sustainability and grower welfare,” Morris stated.
Highlighting the balance of growth and environmental responsibility, Morris stressed that as PNG works to expand its palm oil industry, it must do so in a way that is mindful of the environment and compliant with international sustainability standards.
“We have a responsibility to ensure that the expansion of our palm oil industry does not come at the expense of our natural environment. Protecting our forests, rivers, and biodiversity must go hand-in-hand with increasing productivity and improving livelihoods. A vibrant palm oil industry in PNG must be built on strong environmental safeguards,” he stated.
He emphasised the need to adopt sustainable land-use policies, minimise deforestation, and implement environmentally friendly farming techniques. PNG’s membership in CPOPC provides a platform to learn from countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, who have made strides in achieving sustainable palm oil production.
“Through collaboration, we can ensure that the palm oil we produce meets international standards for sustainability. This not only strengthens our position in global markets but also secures the long-term viability of the industry for future generations,” Hon. Morris added.
Morris expressed his gratitude to the Palm Oil Minister, Francis Maneke, and the hard-working board and management for their K216,000 funding in March 2024. The funds provided subsidies for seedlings and fertiliser, directly benefiting small growers in Milne Bay.
“This funding reduced the cost of seedlings from K22–K26 down to K16–K18, while also subsidising fertilisers. Such support ensures small growers can continue contributing to this vital sector and strengthens their capacity to produce high-quality palm oil sustainably. I thank Hon. Francis Maneke and the Marape-Rosso Government for prioritising the needs of our growers and supporting the future of PNG’s palm oil industry,” Morris said.
Morris is adamant Minister Manake will introduce the Oil Palm policy and supporting legislation in the next Parliament sitting that will revitalize the industry. He acknowledged the overwhelming support of Parliament in the ratification process.
“This are the kind of decisions we must make, in modernising agriculture in this country, as we move into our 50th anniversary.” Morris stressed.
CPOPC membership also offers PNG an opportunity to advocate for its palm oil industry on the global stage. The council enables its members to collectively address trade barriers, combat misinformation, and promote the economic and environmental benefits of sustainable palm oil.
“By being part of this council, PNG can showcase the high-quality standards of its palm oil and attract international investors to our industry. It is an opportunity to build partnerships that will empower our growers, enhance our sustainability efforts, and ensure that palm oil remains a cornerstone of our economy,” Morris added.
Morris concluded by calling on all stakeholders in PNG’s palm oil sector to embrace this opportunity and work collectively to address challenges and seize new opportunities.
“Our membership in CPOPC is not just a milestone—it is a call to action. Together, we can ensure the sustainability of the palm oil industry, empower our communities, and drive economic growth for the future of Papua New Guinea. Let us move forward with determination, learning from others while showcasing the strength of our people and our industry.”
This milestone cements PNG’s place in the global palm oil industry and sets the stage for a brighter, more sustainable future. Through collaboration, innovation, and determination, PNG is poised to lead the way in sustainable palm oil production, ensuring prosperity for growers, workers, and communities nationwide.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Mine extension review progressing,02/01/2025,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2726,"The Ok Tedi Community Mine Continuation Agreement (CMCA) Extension Review has made significant progress with community meetings and the Working Group Meetings (WGM) towards the end of 2024.
OTML managing director and chief executive officer, Kedi Ilimbit said the significant progress in the CMCA Extension Review underscores our commitment to meaningful community engagement and transparency.
""Transparency has been a cornerstone of this process. Bringing village leaders to Tabubil to visit the mine site, including the Engineered Waste Rock Dump, the Bige dredging, stockpile rehabilitation, and Pyrite Concentrate storage on the West Bank, ensures they are well informed and confident in the efforts taken by the company to manage environmental impact. ""The open dialogue we’ve fostered with leaders across the eight CMCA regions has strengthen trust and confidence in OTML, and we are committed to maintaining this collaborative approach throughout the review process,"" Mr Ilimbit said.
Held in Tabubil, Western Province, this high-level discussion brought together lead delegates from eight CMCA regions and six mine villages to present their communities’ positions and receive feedback from OTML.
The CMCA, established by legislation in 2001, ensures that communities impacted by OTML’s operations receive equitable economic and social benefits. This review supports OTML’s planned mine life extension from 2026 to 2033. It began with 158 village meetings earlier this year, followed by two regional meetings in Daru, Kiunga, and Tabubil which involved engagement of over 300 leaders, including youth and women representatives.
“Historically, women and youth were not represented at these discussions, however, they are now included at all levels of meeting,” said Michael Miise, OTML’s Superintendent of Sustainability Planning & CMCA. “Their inclusion ensures a more representative process, reflecting our commitment to inclusivity.”
Transparency has been a cornerstone of the review process, so all village leaders were brought to Tabubil, and they visited the mine site and Bige operations to see for themselves the works happening here. At the mine they got to see the location of the Engineered Waste Rock Dump 1 whilst at Bige they visited the dredging operations, rehabilitation area, and the Pyrite Concentrate storage pits on the West Bank.
“Leaders from across the eight CMCA regions appreciated the opportunity to observe mining operations firsthand and engage directly with OTML’s Executive Leadership Team, including Mr Ilimbit,” Mr Miise noted. “This open dialogue has strengthened trust and confidence.”
Formal negotiations occurred from October 29 - 31 in Tabubil, between OTML and 64 regional leaders and 20 mine village representatives. Other stakeholders included Kumul Minerals Holdings Limited (KMHL), Mineral Resources Development Corporation, and Fly River Provincial Government, Mineral Resources Authority (MRA) and other State agencies.
Independent facilitators from Tanorama PNG Limited and Observers ensured adherence to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent principles in all the meetings. An Independent Advisor was also engaged at the Working Group meeting to provide advice to matters relating to the compensation package.
The review process will continue in February 2025 with more regional and working group meetings and negotiations. A new compensation package and CMCA agreement is expected to be finalized by August 2025, followed by village-level endorsements of the package in October.
“The updated CMCA will secure a renewed social license for OTML to operate while driving socio-economic development in Western Province and Papua New Guinea,” Miise stated. “We are committed to transparency, collaboration, and delivering on our promises.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Breeding essential for Wariman Abattoir,24/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2661,"Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, delivered the keynote address for the revival of the Urimo Cattle Station last week, said the Abattoir at Wariman will be a white elephant unless they first have a large breeding farm.
In his keynote address on behalf of the Prime Minister, Minister Maru commended the Livestock Minister and Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) for the excellent initiative and efforts to date to revive the Wariman Livestock Station on the outskirts of Wewak which in the past had the Provincial abattoir and used to have a holding yard for cattle before slaughter. The station was also used as a quarantine yard to quarantine cattle coming from Australia.
Minister Maru said, ""The efforts by LDC is the start of the revival of the cattle industry in East Sepik Province that was killed by a batch of cattle with cattle tick that came from Australia. This was a hard lesson and one we cannot repeat in our country if we are going to revive the cattle industry in Provinces like East Sepik.""
He further stated, ""Today, PNG imports over K300 million worth of beef meat annually from Australia and New Zealand despite our vast potential to replace beef imports. Generally, PNG's industry has diminished to mere 40,000 heads, and currently, we have no cattle industry policy to import cattle from Australia or any other country for breeding to increase the national breeding herd. The local supply of new breeding stock is limited to the low gene pool. Beefing up the national cattle population is a major national issue that requires an enabling policy environment.""
""While I welcome the revival of the Wariman station, LDC must first sort where the breeding farm and production or grow out farms will be to supply cattle for the slaughter at the abattoir at Wariman. You cannot invest in building an abattoir without cattle to slaughter. This is putting the cart before the horse. The construction and operation of an abattoir is way down the value chain. The decision to build, own, and operate an abattoir is based on stock numbers and through-put and market demand, which determines kill numbers and kill weights and size of the abattoir. In the days of my father, a pioneer didiman, Wariman was supplied by the 15,000-hectare Urimo Cattle station that provided cattle every week for slaughter at Wariman complimented by small village-based cattle farms and a number of bigger farms including the farm ran by the Catholic Mission at Timbunke.""
Minister Maru challenged LDC to first sort out and establish cattle breeding farms in the Province, especially at Urimo and in the Sepik Plains.
""With the recent Marape-Rosso Government's decision to establish the National Palm Oil Company starting with operations in the Sepik Plain, we can build a large integrated cattle and oil palm industry in the Province with palm oil expeller to feed the cattle in feed lots like what is happening with Numando beef in Kimbe,"" said Minister Maru.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

KPHL starts work to secure PNG’s energy future,20/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2629,"Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) has commenced construction on a strategic Jet A1 fuel import and storage facility near the Motukea Wharf. This milestone, handled by contractor China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering (a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation), addresses Papua New Guinea's recurring fuel supply crises.
KPHL Managing Director, Wapu Sonk emphasized the facility's strategic importance.
""We have to build for the country. That’s for the fuel security of the country. So it's a strategic asset we are building, you know, sometimes, some decisions that we make is for strategic purposes,"" he said.
The project’s first phase involves constructing four 3,000-cubic-meter fuel tanks, along with state-of-the-art offloading, loading, safety, and environmental facilities.
Sonk elaborated on challenges encountered, citing delays due to engineering adjustments necessary for an operational international wharf. A specialized mobile loading unit sourced from the Netherlands will address these complexities.
He underscored the facility's role in maintaining national energy reserves, providing fuel security against potential private-sector disruptions like those seen with Puma Energy.
William Duma, Minister for State-Owned Enterprises, acknowledged the interim role Ok Tedi Mining Limited played in supplying fuel during the crisis but emphasised the need for a permanent solution.
""That is where Kumul Petroleum Holdings comes in. We will work together, and as the MD correctly said, this is an essential service, a strategic one. We just had to have our own facilities on standby,"" Duma stated.

Pasca Gas Agreement Signed,20/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2626,"The Pasca Gas Agreement was signed on Thursday 19th September in Port Moresby between the project developers, Twinza and Mineral Resource Development Company and the State, paving the way for Front End Engineering Design works to commence.
A final investment decision on this project is expected within 30 months.
This is following the initialing of the agreement in Sydney last week.
Prime Minister James Marape welcomed the signing and boasted of how well this project was negotiated by the State Negotiating Team, and the benefits that are in it.
This project will be owned fifty-fifty by Twinza and MRDC through its subsidiary, Hevehe Holdings Limited with PNG to gain 70 per cent of the revenue generated from the project.
“I want to appreciate Twinza, Mr Quantrill and the team from Twinza, who have given us an unprecedented total stake take at 70 per cent of the entire project economic pie.
“That includes a better-defined royalty (at 2 per cent but a better-defined royalty).
“I know exactly what I mean by “a better 2 per cent”. A better 2 per cent has only one deduction in it. And not three deductions that is in the other gas and oil agreements that we’ve had thus far.
“A better royalty, we’ve secured production levy at 3 per cent, we’ve secured development levy at 2 per cent, we’ve secured additional fiscal stability. They’ve paid a premium, the project will enjoy the present tax regime we have. The agreement we signed will run the full course of the harvest of the foundational harvest. So they paying a premium of 2 per cent fiscal stability tax. Total tax is 32 per cent now. Incase you don’t know, corporate tax is at 30 per cent so they’re paying 32 per cent.
He said despite taking a while to reach this agreement, he thanked Twinza for their patience and adhering to the government’s requests and promised to return their favour.
“I also want to indicate to our investors who are here, both MRDC and Twinza, you have shown good to the country by giving us close to 70 per cent take. We will aggregate other resources in the vicinity.
And when the spirit of this agreement matures, you stand to benefit from aggregation of resources in the Gulf of Papua. In my heart of hearts, I believe our ancestors will rest well knowing that we’ve honored them with a good deal.
I’m sure we will find more resources in the Gulf of Papua, in the Southern fault belt of Papua as well as the Eastern fault belt of Papua.”
MRDC who is the other shareholder in this project through, welcomed this milestone signing, describing it as a partnership of equals.
“When we talk about partnership of equals, its not just in words, but in deeds.
And you can see in the quality of the agreement that we've done with the state in terms of definition of royalty, equity, DMO and also taxation. Also, in terms of our sale and purchase agreement with Twinza, it accommodates all of those. So in the Hevehe company, more than 50% equity is owned by all the entities that is Gulf-related.
So Gulf related entity like PRK, pipeline, Gobe including the Gulf provincial government which has 10% in Hevehe. So Gulf-related entities are already 50% owner of that 50 and the other 50% includes our subsidiaries in mining and also the PNG LNG. So all our landowners are in fact the risk themselves becoming the risk takers.”
Executive Director of Twinza, Stephen Quantrill is excited about the project and said Twinza is happy to contribute to help achieve the Prime Minister’s vision for PNG.
“So this for us is a massive milestone moment. It sets out a timeline and a timetable for us to achieve final investment decision and award of the license in between. We have a lot of work to do to develop the project, but, you know, every set of leadership should always leave, your country or your team, whatever your responsibility, leave it in a better place than you found it.
And, you know, it's one thing we've always admired with the Prime minister and your team, is that you have an ambition both look after the short term and with an eye on the future. Prime Minister has often spoken about his vision for a 1 trillion-kina economy by 2048. And we hope that this moment represents an important milestone that will go down in history, as a moment that supported that vision, that made a contribution to that vision.”
The project comes in two phases – the first phase is the oil harvest where 135 million barrels of oil are expected to be extracted and the second phase is the Gas Harvest.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
Wariman station reopened,20/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2625,"The Wariman livestock station in Wewak, East Sepik Province in its first phase of infrastructural development, was reopened on Thursday, 19th December.
The facility is now ready to start its work after it was abandoned in the 1990s due to concerns over the health of cattle.
Minister for Livestock Sekie Agisa, East Sepik Province Deputy Governor David Kausik, Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru and Livestock Development Corporation Managing Director Terry Koim were present to witness the reopening.
Wariman, located on Portion 126 along the West Coast Road in East Sepik, spans 68 hectares ostatete land under the Livestock Development Corporation (LDC).
In its prime, Wariman housed a fully functioning abattoir that provided vital market facilities for livestock farmers in the East Sepik region.
Unfortunately, the site was abandoned in the 1990s due to concerns over cattle health.
For more than 30 years, the land lay idle, occupied by settlers who had made it their home. That changed in 2020, when Prime Minister Marape directed the LDC to take stock, reclaim, and restore assets around the country. Wariman was prioritised.
Agisa said the reopening of the station is in line with the Marape-Rosso government’s focus on investing in agricultural and livestock in the country.
“Marape has created Coffee, Oil Palm and Livestock ministries because he sees the importance of these sectors, as key economic generators of Papua New Guinea,” he said.
He said the challenge now is breeding and importing of cattle.
Deputy Governor Kausik thanked LDC for the working partnership with the government, which resulted in the reopening of the station. This will open doors for farmers in East Sepik to import, breed and export their livestock produce.
However, he called for effective implementation of the project come 2025.
Koim said LDC will work closely with the Ministry of International Trade and Investment to implement the project.
Koim also announced that Bonstock Rural Exports Limited, an Australian owned and operated company focusing on offering livestock export services has partnered with LCD to import cattle to framers in East Sepik.","Agriculture, Anticipation",Agriculture,Anticipation

An SME website and an economic empowerment program were launched by the Rabaul MP on Friday, December 13th, at the district headquarters at Kurakakaul during the opening of the District Education Resource Centre.
The empowerment program aims to financially support small businesses in the four LLGs based on certain requirements, such as an Investment Promotion Authority registration, legitimate ID card, a verification letter from ward member and other important documents.
When giving a brief on the district SME website and economic empowerment program, the District Commerce Officer, Ian Andy, highlighted that the website will assist local SMEs in marketing their products to a wider audience.
The website will also make it convenient for customers to enquire directly with small local businesses, which should enhance their SME’s image and give them a competitive advantage.
Andy outlined that it is cost-effective and there is flexibility where details and prices, or fees, of certain products and services, can be updated.
“We have just completed updating data on the active local SMEs in the four LLGs of Rabaul district and as soon as all information is confirmed, we will upload and the website can be accessed by next week,” Andy stated.
He added that any small business in the district who wishes to advertise using website can visit the District Commerce Office for assistance.

Morobe liquor board needs funding: Chairman,18/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2609,"The Morobe Provincial Liquor Board has outlined the need for more funding support to carry out its role in the province.
This year, the Morobe Provincial Government allocated K250,000, with chairman Giasi Lasse saying that amount is only sufficient for the board’s allowance.
“K250,000 to conduct liquor operations in Morobe Province is funny,” he told Lae media during their fifth sitting. “K250,000 is only for our sitting allowance. 10 of us board members. Sitting allowance and end-of-the-month stipend. Those are covered and that’s it, no more money.”
Lasse said each member is entitled to at least K300 or K400 per sitting, while each member will get K10,000 at the end of the year.
Members of a provincial liquor board are political appointees charged with the important role of controlling or regulating the micro manufacturing and retailing of liquor in respective provinces.
Their main functions involve the issuance of liquor licences based on recommendation from the provincial administration, and after all boxes have been ticked. They are also expected to inspect premises before issuing licences, and conduct awareness on responsible alcohol consumption.
The new members of the Morobe liquor licensing board, led by chairman and popular local musician, Giasi Lasse, were sworn in on Thursday, February 15th, 2024.
To date, however, the board is yet to do monitoring and surveillance in the 10 districts of Morobe.
With Morobe having the largest land mass in PNG, the chairman outlined that the liquor board would need at least K500,000 to effectively carry out its role.
“We need to go around and do awareness and talk to the people,” he emphasised. “Many of them are not aware of the consequences of selling illegal liquor. So, we need good funding to run our programs. Maybe, when we go out to the field and work, we will help reduce law and order problems.”
The liquor board has reported an income of K3.3 million this year, with an estimated K5 million in revenue loss due to a lack of monitoring and surveillance, including outstanding trading fees owed by certain Lae individuals and businesses.","Government, Frustration",Government,Frustration

Largest share in history of PNG resource projects,16/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2585,"The State taking 70 percent in the Pasca deal is the highest benefit ever in all resource projects in PNG’s history.
Prime Minister James Marape outlined this at the “initialing” of the Pasca A gas condensate field on the sidelines of the 2024 PNG Investment Week on Tuesday, December 10th.
The oil and gas project is expected to generate K15 billion of revenue directly to the state, with more than K30 billion in terms of gross domestic product impact.
The Pasca deal involves the State taking 70 percent inclusive of taxes, royalty and equity, with the license jointly owned by Twinza and Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC).
“I just want to say, on behalf of Papua New Guinea, I want to appreciate the investor on the table, for you to give to State a total of 70 percent – that includes equity and royalties and tax, as well as other levies associated with it – including local content and spinoffs,” said PM Marape in Sydney.
“Higher than P’nyang that we’ve secured at 63 percent. I want to say thank you very much to Twinza, as the company, for responding to the needs of our country.”
PM Marape described negotiations as “long, tedious and cumbersome” but worth the wait as once inked, no government after him can change it.
“For the first time, historically, 50 percent international investor, 50 percent local investor in MRDC. So, that’s a historic partnership,” he outlined.
“Of the MRDC stake, based on PANGU Pati policy to empower provinces and landowners at 40 percent, from the 50 percent, 40 percent of that 50 percent – subject to negotiations at the forum at Kerema – we will pass it back to the host province, on behalf of the people.
“We are empowering people where it matters most.”
Gulf Governor, Sir Chris Haiveta, thanked the State Negotiating Team for their efforts in the last 30-60 months, expressing delight with the 40 percent equity that the national government has indicated that will be available for the Gulf Provincial Government.
The PM said the project will initially produce natural gas liquids, including condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), while also establishing the groundwork for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
Security efforts highlighted in Sydney,16/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2581,"The 2024 PNG Investment Week highlighted the work that has gone into making PNG safer and more secure for investment opportunities.
Hosted in Sydney, Australia, from December 6th to 11th, the event not only focused on the extractive industry but also drove attention to other sectors and issues that needed to be promoted or supported in the country.
President of the PNG Chamber of Resources and Energy (PNGCORE), Anthony Smare, said this year’s program has been tweaked to use the investment gravity that PNG’s powerful resource and energy sector has, to drive attention to other sectors.
The work that the National Government and its bilateral partners have in making PNG safer and more secure, such as the Defence Cooperation Agreement with the United States, and the Bilateral Security Treaty with Australia, were highlighted.
The Defence Cooperation Agreement, signed on May 22, 2023, includes a commitment by the United States to spend more than US$3.8 billion dollars – more than the value of construction of the Wafi project.
The agreement, which took almost a decade to conclude, aims to address long-standing issues of morale and capacity in the PNG Defence Force.
“We should be talking about these bilateral agreements as they have a big impact on investment,” said Smare.
“And the government should be congratulated for these important agreements; a product of exhaustive and diligent engagement with PNG’s partners.
“Each and every one of these bilateral agreements contributes to make PNG safer for investing, and also significantly contributes to the PNG economy at a significant scale.”
This year’s event was bigger than last year, which had around 1,100 attendees. Over 1,700 attendees and 99 expo booths registered this year, with a program that had 102 speakers for over four days.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

These resources are set to empower local farmers with the skills and tools to cultivate healthier, higher-yielding crops, meeting the rising demand for certified planting materials both domestically and internationally.
“On behalf of the people of Kainantu, Obura-Wonenera, Henganofi, Lufa, and Eastern Highlands. I thank FPDA for building this facility in Kainantu. It could easily have been in Lae, Mt Hagen, or anywhere else in this country, but the FPDA Board strategically decided on Kainantu. I congratulate FPDA chairman Chow and his Board, as well as the management led by CEO Mark Worinu, for this milestone achievement,” he said.
Boito further emphasised the facility’s potential to train farmers, enabling them to venture into small businesses and contribute to achieving the government’s targets in Vision 2050 and the National Agriculture Sector Plan. He called on farmers to embrace the opportunity.
“I urge farmers, now that this facility has been built, to come here to be trained and go back and increase your production.”
Boito also urged the people of Kainantu to take pride in the new facility and maintain its pristine condition. “After one month, I don’t want to come back here and see betelnut stains on the cement. Look after this facility and you will reap more benefits. This building has changed the face of Kainantu. Let us all take ownership of this facility and look after it,” he said.
Boito encouraged the people of Kainantu, Obura-Wonenera, and Henganofi to work with the Department of Agriculture and the Marape-Rosso Government to drive rural development, replace imports, create jobs, and contribute K30 billion from agriculture to the economy by 2030.
“The Government stands ready to support young people to achieve this. We have to till the soil to harvest,” he said.
“This groundbreaking initiative, supported by the Australian Government, reflects the shared vision of driving sustainable development and empowering hardworking farmers across Papua New Guinea. The Fabian Chow Training Centre is more than just a facility; it’s a symbol of transformation and hope for the agricultural sector.”","Agriculture, Joy",Agriculture,Joy

The magnitude of family and sexual violence in Papua New Guinea is a serious challenge. Almost two-thirds of women report having experienced some form of physical or sexual violence.
The Bel isi PNG program is a public-private partnership that aims to encourage the corporate sector, in collaboration with the government and civic society, to take a transformative role in changing attitudes towards family and sexual violence while also providing access to immediate care and support for survivors.","Social, Trust",Social,Trust

President of the PNG Chamber of Resources & Energy (PNG CORE), Anthony Smaré, highlighted this in his introductory remarks on Monday, December 9th, during the official opening of the 2024 PNG Investment Week in Sydney, Australia.
“Firstly, our second oldest major resource project, the Ok Tedi Mine, celebrated its 40th anniversary of operations,” he stated in front of a packed Darling Harbour Theatre at the International Convention Centre Sydney.
“For many years prior to PNG LNG, Ok Tedi was PNG’s largest single tax payer. It has also made important social development contributions to impacted communities.
“It’s extension of mine life to 2036 and beyond means that it can continue to contribute meaningfully to the people of Western and PNG.
“Secondly, we celebrated the 10-year anniversary of production of PNG LNG Project; PNG’s largest ever investment project and certainly a project that was a game changer for the PNG economy.”
Smaré said when the project was in development stage, many observers doubted its success, saying it was too risky to be put in a country perceived as unstable as PNG.
“However, it has turned out to be one of the world’s great gas projects, with safety, competency, and efficiency stats that are among the best in the world, but majority run by trained PNG staff.”
The PNG CORE president congratulated both Ok Tedi, ExxonMobil, their partners, the PNG Government, the landowners and staff on their achievements.
Aside from that, Smaré said this year, though the finalisation of the agreements to progress Wafi and Pasca projects are pending, we did see the advancement of Papua and significant work being done on advancing Pnyang LNG projects.
“We also saw the restart of the giant Porgera mine, and we see significant new expansion work by the Kainantu Gold Mine by K92 and St Barbara’s Simberi gold project,” he continued.
“We also saw the birth of two new banks; TISA Bank and Credit Bank, created to meet unmet demand in PNG’s banking sector.
“And we saw an incredible explosion in cocoa returns as the global cocoa supply downturn led to bumper prices for PNG cocoa, which led to bumper returns to farmers in cocoa regions, particularly the Sepik region and Bougainville.
“These developments in all sectors all contributed to the improved optimism we have seen in the last quarter, and today’s record attendance.”","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
Mining amendment needed,10/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2511,"The extractive industry – mining, oil and gas combined – only contribute 8 percent of revenue to PNG’s coffers.
Winterford Iriohe Eko, the director of the Mineral Resources Authority board, outlined this on Sunday, December 8th, during the regulators’ forum on day one of the 2024 PNG Investment Week.
“This means the rest of the other sectors contribute 90 percent to government revenue,” he stated in his presentation in the Darling Harbour Theatre in Sydney, Australia.
Eko drew attention to the Mining Act 1992, saying while it has guided resource governance for 35 years, the global landscape has significantly evolved.
“Our laws have not kept pace, leaving loopholes that allow a disproportionate share of wealth to flow out of our country while our people struggle to benefit from natural resources that are rightfully theirs.
“Since 2009, the government initiated a review of the mining regulatory framework, acknowledging the need for reform after the regional public consultations from 2010-2014, when intense consultations were held specifically with the then PNG Chamber of Mines and Petroleum from 2014-2017 and thereafter.
“Many of the people involved in that consultation are now senior executives in the PNG Chamber of Resources and Energy.”
Eko said the Prime Minister gave an undertaking in a 2020 meeting to introduce the regulatory framework in 2025 on the condition that Wafi-Golpu, in Morobe Province, and the Frieda River project in East and West Sepik, be brought into the development phase.
“Unfortunately, these projects did not meet the milestone set by the Prime Minister during the 2020 meeting with the PNG Chamber of Mines and Petroleum in Brisbane.
“This inaction cost the people of Papua New Guinea valuable time and opportunities to secure a more equitable share of our resource wealth.
“While international investors and companies reap immense profits from our natural wealth, our citizens continue to face underfunded public services, limited infrastructure and persistent struggle to make ends meet.
“As we approach 2025; a year when Papua New Guinea celebrates its 50th independence anniversary, we must seize this milestone to refine our extractive industry regulations. We owe it to the people of Papua New Guinea and the future of our nation.”","Business, Anger",Business,Anger
Newmont defends tax payment,09/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2508,"The Lihir gold mine, in New Ireland Province, has always paid its taxes in full.
Newmont Corporation PNG’s managing director, Mark Rodgers, outlined this in today’s second session of the 2024 PNG Investment Week in Sydney, Australia.
“From 2013 to 2023, Lihir paid K2.4 billion in total taxes, levies and excise duties – of which corporate income tax was K441.5 million,” said Rodgers, who is attending the investment event for the first time.
“Over the same 10-year period, Lihir also paid K797 million in royalties.
“We are pleased to report that from January to September this calendar year, the mine has contributed K118 million in corporate taxes, K79.4 million in royalties and over K1 billion in payments to PNG suppliers – of which over K743 million went to vendors from New Ireland Province.
“We don’t just view our relationships with governments, communities, and local partners as obligations; they are fundamental to who we are and how we operate.
“Our purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining is a testament to this.”
The company has re-emphasised its tax contributions following a number of statements from Prime Minister James Marape saying that Lihir pays no corporate tax to the country. PM Marape had also made the same statement in last year’s PNG Resources & Energy Investment Conference.
Newmont is relatively new to Papua New Guinea after acquiring PNG’s largest gold mine in November 2023.
The session was attended by Prime Minister James Marape, Treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey, Petroleum Minister, Jimmy Maladina, Australian Government representatives, PNG state agencies and foreign investors.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
"Electrification commitment needed, stresses NEA",09/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2507,"The PNG Government needs to commit to bringing electricity to all households.
Chairman of the National Energy Authority (NEA), Joseph Gabut, was quite frank in his presentation at the regulators forum that started the PNG Investment Week in Sydney, Australia, on Sunday, December 8th.
“A very important agenda of the NEA, we have to bring electricity access to all the households in the country – at least 70 percent of them by 2030,” Gabut outlined. “And 100 percent by renewable energy in 2050.
“We haven’t even started. There hasn’t been any commitment by the Government. And it’s important; there should be funding for this very important program or plan. We could help most of our people who are living out in the rural areas. They are not connected to the grid and probably will never be connected to the grid.
“So, we have to find smart solutions to bring electricity to people in the remotest parts of PNG.
“I’m very concerned about this issue.”
Gabut further drew attention to state-owned entity, PNG Power Ltd, who is yet to start on the rural electrification commitment.
On the other hand, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the US have been helping with electrification access for rural areas while helping with work on distribution lines.","Development, Fear",Development,Fear
"PNG is friends to all, PM tells investors",09/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2502,"Prime Minister James Marape officially opened the 2024 Papua New Guinea Investment Week in Sydney this morning with the statement: “PNG is friends to all”.
He painted PNG as an environment conducive to investment, with the government focused on improving law and order through the Defence Cooperation Program and infrastructure development.
PM Marape emphasised that PNG is transparent with its dealings with international partners, and is “friends to all countries”, including the USA and China.
“We are in all spaces; East, West, North and South,” said the PM. “Papua New Guinea is placed in a better place to capitalise on all our relations.
“Very soon, our new foreign policy will be pronounced. As I speak today, it is being propagated. Minister Justin Tkatchenko will give a brief indication. But deeply embedded in the foreign policy is ‘friends to all, enemies to none’. That friendship, of course, will never compromise our democratic values, the fundamental tenets we hold close to heart; democracy and free market economy. But we relate to all economies, especially those economies that buy our produce.”
PM Marape assured potential investors that PNG’s foreign relations will enable their market access.
He outlined that PNG has close relations with 20 of the top economies in the world.
“The number one economy in USA is our deep, traditional partner. They’re making a big rebound back into PNG; their presence is getting bigger as we speak,” he stated.
“The second biggest economy, China, remains a constant partner. They continue buying over 50 percent of our products. The last successful bilateral, I had President Xi Jinping in Beijing, I looked across to him and I said: ‘I have LNG to sell’. And he said, we will buy. Three billion metric tonnes of LNG for Papua LNG was conversed on the table and they decided to pick 3 billion metric tonnes of gas from PNG.
“We have our third biggest economy, Japan; one of our reliable, strong partner nations. To all Japanese investors here, I want to say: ‘Arigatou gozaimasu’. You are foundation partner in buying our gas.
“In 2014 I was there when the ‘Spirit of Hela’ left Port Moresby and we were at the Tepco (Tokyo Electric Power Company Inc.) yard in Japan. You were our foundation customer in PNG LNG.”
PM Marape also mentioned Indonesia, India, France, Germany, PNG’s traditional link to UK, South Korea and PNG’s close friend, Australia.
He emphasised that investors will have no problem when it comes to finding a market for their products in the bilateral relationships that PNG honours, values and relates with.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Negotiations on Wafi-Golpu and Pasca Projects at advanced stage,07/12/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2489,"Prime Minister James Marape hopes that the State Negotiating Team (SNT) and investors of major projects in the country, particularly the Pasca LNG project in Gulf and Wafi-Golpu in Morobe province would progress the final talks on the margins of the Investment Week conference in Sydney this week.
Prime Minister Marape said the Wafi-Golpu mining and Pasca gas projects are at “advanced, matured stages” of negotiations, with Government very cautious of getting details of the contracts accurate as it strives to secure nothing less than 55 percent of the total project economic value over the life of the projects.
He said the negotiations have been long because Government and project proponents needed to resolve many issues in both projects, which have now been reduced to a few major ones needing both the developers and the State to finalise consistent with law and government policies.
“For Wafi-Golpu, we are now tidying up the last three issues that will enable us to frame the Mine Development Contract. Likewise, the State Negotiating Team is working with Pasca investors to complete negotiations for the construct of the gas agreement. We are exchanging drafts, debating issues, and scrutinizing the details to make sure the text is correct and matches the intent in our government policies.
“As you know, our PANGU-led Government works very hard to secure above 55 percent of project economic value. This includes our take in royalty, equity, and tax.
“It has been long and tedious but these agreements are contractual and legally-binding for the length of the agreement and therefore need to be carefully looked at,” he said.
The Prime Minister said it was important that his government entered these project agreements while following due process and the laws of the country, and was working at securing 55 percent or above of the total project duration in the period of the license.
“So we have to make sure that we get it right in terms of the benefits that we are securing for our people. Because once we sign the Mine Development Contract and issue the Special Mining Lease, or the gas agreement, we will not change it.”","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

LDC to import live cattle,26/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2373,"In enhancing the rollout of the government’s National Cattle Breeding Program, Livestock Development Corporation (LDC) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with one of Australia’s leading live cattle exporters, Bondstock Rural Exports (BRE).
The signing will pave the way for LDC to import live cattle, especially pregnant heifers from Queensland, Australia. The MoU signed on 24th of November 2024, will facilitate the importation of breeder cattle from Australia pending the establishment of appropriate biosecurity requirements.
PNG’s potential to breed more than a million head of cattle in less than 20 years, was acclaimed by the Australian Livestock Exporters Council (ALEC) chairman David Galvin, who visited three weeks before the signing.
The establishment of initial talks between the Ministry of Livestock and the LDC Board earlier this year had resulted in the signing. This is after LDC had taken back and reclaimed most of its ranches from settlers and rehabilitated them to operational status, directed by the PNG government several years back.
LDC board chairman, Martin Ginyaru said the MoU indicates progress in the revitalization of the livestock industry to ensure PNG attains a certain level of self-reliance in meat production and also to promote food security.
He further stated that the MoU builds on the bilateral relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea.
BRE director, Ian Bradford acknowledged LDC with the level of progress on the ground, including the re-development of ranches.

Busu hydropower project progressed,26/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2372,"The Busu hydro project, once fully completed will try to address the power generation issues currently faced in Morobe Province.
A Memorandum of Understanding for the Busu Hydropower Project was signed between the Morobe Provincial Government, Morobe Resources Holdings Limited, and PNG Power Limited on Monday (Nov. 25th) in Port Moresby.
The signing includes a K1 million funding to kick off the pre-feasibility study, the first phase of the project.
PPL Acting chief executive officer, Ivan Pekaea welcomed the support of Morobe Governor, Luther Wenge and the Morobe Provincial Government, Morobe Resource Holding Limited to partner with PPL to develop the project.
Pekaea said this will enable PNG Power to support electricity supply to rural communities in Morobe and Ramu Grid in line with the Government’s Policy to connect 70 percent of households by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050
“We are excited about the Busu Hydropower Project and the partnership we are putting together with Morobe Provincial Government and Morobe Resource Holdings Limited to develop this project,” he said.
Pakaea said Busu is one of the country’s fast-flowing rivers posing a cumex of 50-100 square meters and a potential of 75- 100 megawatts (MV). He said Busu provides immense potential for hydropower development. Being close to the Lae and Taraka substations makes it even more ideal.
“Lae at the moment is estimated to have a peak load of 40MW, however, this peak load does not include the off-line customers using their own generators.
“We could be talking more than 50MWs in Lae at the moment. Also, this does not include new load emanating from development activities in Lae.
“Given the natural conditions of Busu River, and PNG Power's need for a stable baseload generator near our Lae load, we feel Busu is an ideal option to develop through this partnership,” he said.
Meantime, Governor Wenge said lack of power is an ongoing issue faced in Lae that is affecting business houses and the wider community. Therefore, the Morobe government stands firm in supporting the project.","Infrastructure, Anticipation",Infrastructure,Anticipation
Insect threatens coffee industry,26/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2363,"Papua New Guinea Coffee production and exports have been affected by Coffee Borers.
This has had an adverse effect on the income of local farmers, which is being reduced from 40 to 50 percent due to the Coffee Berry Borers.
Highlands Farmers and Settlers Association, President, Wilson Thompson said the Coffee Berry Borer which is a harmful insect to coffee worldwide is affecting coffee production in the country.
According to the Coffee Hunters, the Coffee Berry Borer or Coffee Borer Beetle (CBB) is an insect found around the world and prevalent in most coffee-producing countries. It is among the most harmful pests to commercial coffee plantations and can attack 50-100 percent of berries on a farm if no control measures are applied.
Coffee is a major cash crop in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, accounting for over 90 percent of the country's coffee production.
“Trials on 100kg cherry coffee showed it weighed 50 to 60kg, when pulped, fermentation and washed and weight is reduced to 40kg. Dried parchment weight showed between 20-25 kg. The more parchment or dried coffee with infested beans is held and not dried to 11-15 percent moisture content, the borer continues to survive in the bean.
“The cherry to parchment process is in the hands of the smallholders and they are the biggest losers when their coffee becomes floater and half the bean is eaten or destroyed.  The exporters are also faced with rejection of their green beans if more defects are found in the green beans.”
Whilst the farmers know little to deal with the insect, there are also concerns about red ants in Bulolo that make it difficult for farmers to pick or deal with coffee trees without being attacked by the ants.","Agriculture, Sadness",Agriculture,Sadness
Packaged Pomio rice on display,26/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2360,"Pomio farmers, in East New Britain Province, proudly displayed their packaged rice in a recent event at Palmalmal.
They were among local farmers who set up booths during the annual ENB Provincial Administration (ENBPA) Economic Sector Conference from November 18-22.
However, unlike in the past, the farmers who came from the three different rural LLGs of Central Pomio, Inland Pomio and Melkoi, brought with them finished products that were processed and packaged locally.
The group from Melkoi LLG displayed packaged rice of the jasmine variety, selling for K8 a packet.
‘Lemem Rice’, which means ‘our rice’, is in white and brown products.
Trained at the OISCA Rabaul International Centre, lead farmer Peter Telesi said after collecting a kilogram (kg) of rice seedlings from Uvol Vocational Training Centre, he decided to do a nursery and produced 80kg out of the 1kg he got.
“A rice mill was given to us by OISCA in 1999 but for a decade there was no active rice planting by locals,” shared Telesi.
“I think this is because people could still afford a packet of rice from the shop. However, when the prices of rice started soaring, that was when farmers, especially within Central Melkoi area, realised that it was time to plant rice.”
During that time, Telesi supplied a kilogram of rice seedlings each to 80 farmers to replant and increase production on their individual farms.
""These 80 farmers have produced about 200kg of rice from the seedlings they planted, and this year we managed to produce a total of 15 tonnes of rice,” he proudly stated.
“We have also expanded the variety to 3, with the addition of Finch white (long grain) and I-R-10 (short grain).”
Telesi managed to fix the mill with assistance from the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Livestock to get spare parts, and have been progressing rice production since, with the support from the LLG rural development officer (RDO).
The farmers are planning to go into paddy rice planting next year onwards, from the current upland rice farming practice, while training has been rolled out to a number of educational institutions in the LLG.
Melkoi LLG rural development officer, Cosmas Koemparea Kolai, who is in charge of programs in the agriculture and livestock sector, said since taking up his post as Melkoi LLG RDO in 2022, rice was identified among the priority cash crops for the LLG, especially in the Central Melkoi area.
“Mr. Telesi was identified as the lead farmer and we constructed a seed garden for seedlings that were distributed to farmers,” he stated.
The rice farming program is being used to address issues such as food security and self reliance, given the shipping schedule, which usually arrives in the LLG after a fortnight or even a month.
Since 2022, the farmers have cultivated 1,200 hectares of rice farms, while a business group has established 4 hectares which will be used as a seed bank.
“Apart from providing good organic food for the farmers’ daily meals, rice has helped generate income for the farmers,” Kolai outlined.
“By 2025, we will increase our production and involve paddy farming to supply our local markets in the LLG.”
Jasmine is a favourite among the farmers and consumers of the locally produced rice in Melkoi LLG, from wards like Uvol, Meletong, Pilematana, Lausus, Esletena to Kenmininga, Mininga, Maso and Tavolo, and a few parts of Warale and Poio.
To complement the rice production, inland fish ponds under an artisanal fisheries program have been established, with two registered fishing groups.
The LLG fisheries sector has a storage facility set up that includes an ice making equipment, located at Ruachana ward.
Village based piggery and poultry farming is done in the wards, with 3 groups given assistance to upgrade from subsistence farming to a mini commercial arrangement.

The partnership makes Kina Bank the fifth financial institution in the country to adopt the Inclusive Green Finance Policy (IGFP), joining ANZ PNG, BSP, Nationwide Microbank, and Women’s Microbank.
Under the Inclusive Green Finance Project, launched in 2021 with funding from the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Kina Bank will develop green loan products and sustainable finance solutions with support from GGGI’s Green Finance Centre (GFC).
This initiative aligns with the global push for environmentally responsible financial practices, further bolstered by a €3 million (PGK 11.47 million) funding pledge from the French Development Agency (AFD).
BPNG Governor Elizabeth Genia emphasized the significance of this collaboration, stating, “the Inclusive Green Finance initiative aligns financial growth with sustainable development. Kina Bank's involvement strengthens our vision of a financially inclusive and environmentally conscious future for PNG.”
Kina Bank CEO Greg Pawson reaffirmed the bank's dedication to sustainability, noting, “this partnership underscores our commitment to delivering financial solutions that balance economic growth and environmental responsibility, benefiting our customers and communities.”

Oil Palm Policy needed to regulate sector,21/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2317,"Oil palm is a thriving industry that has over the years contributed to the economy particularly in terms of exports.
On record, a total of K8.836 billion was generated in the last five years (2018-2022), owing to stable global market prices, making PNG the 5th largest oil palm producer and exporter in the world.
It is also the major source of employment for well over 200,000 Papua New Guineans.
Sustainable palm oil production holds the potential to boost many of Papua New Guinea's development goals.
And a robust Oil Palm Policy is needed to strengthen and regulate this sector.
Speaking on behalf of the Chief Secretary to the Government Ivan Pomaleu, at the Validation workshop of Palm Oil Policy in Kimbe on Tuesday, Manager Policy Division with the PM & NEC, Brendan Pulai said the Department of Prime Minister remains supportive of this policy as it is futuristic and all encompassing, capturing the views and interests of all stakeholders.
He said it also complements the current National Government initiatives to incentivize, empower and grow the rural economies by engaging rural communities.
“All sector initiatives whether it be renewable or non-renewable sectors must have a water tight policy and Oil Palm is no exception.
“There must be alignment with the Vision 2050 and MTDPIV as both of these overarching plans set the basis for the development agenda of the Government.”
Mr Pulai said being a successful industry, Oil Palm has helped sustain many rural economies in PNG and this policy must also complement the government's policy to modernize and to do downstream processing of PNG's Palm Oil. This will in turn increase revenue streams to support the National Budget.
The establishment of the Oil Palm Industry Act is also key to ensuring that the industry is effective, fair and regulated in terms of apportioning proceeds that are derived for the Landowners, including the developer and the state.
“There must be a level playing field for all stakeholders in the policy to enhance the Oil Palm Industry.”
Additionally, he said this policy will set the basis for necessary legislative reforms, including the establishment of the Oil Palm Industry Authority that will provide effective oversight in terms of its overall operations, determining adequate pricing both on the domestic and international markets.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Wau-Waria queries royalty payment,21/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2312,"When will Wau-Waria get its 9 percent of royalty?
This was the question without notice asked by Member for Wau-Waria, Marsh Narewec, in Tuesday’s (November 19) Tutumang session in Lae, Morobe Province.
Narewec outlined that Wau was under Bulolo district until the boundaries were split in 2022, giving rise to the new Wau-Waria district.
Despite the new boundary, the new district still has shares in the Hidden Valley mine.
“The people of Wau-Waria are landowners,” he told the chairman of the Provincial Executive Council (PEC) and Morobe Governor, Luther Wenge.
“Nauti and Winima own percentages in the mine. 50 percent of Hidden Valley is in Wau-Waria.
“It has been 2-and-a-half years as a new district and we have not received any benefit in royalties from Hidden Valley.
“My good minister for mining, when will this 9 percent hit Wau-Waria’s account?”
In response, Morobe’s Mining Minister and Watut local level government president, Waka Daimon, alluded to the royalty distribution within Morobe.
He said the breakup of Hidden Valley royalties are:
•	Bulolo district – 18 percent
•	Watut LLG – 5 percent
•	Wau Rural LLG – 5 percent
•	Bulolo Urban – 4 percent
•	Mumeng LLG – 3 percent
•	Waria LLG – 2 percent
•	Buang LLG – 1 percent
“Following an agreement between the provincial government and local MP, the Governor agreed to give 18 percent of its 36 percent benefit of royalties to us again. Hence, the provincial government only received 18 percent from the Hidden Valley mine.
“However, for Bulolo district, the Ombudsman Commission has put a stop to it. Bulolo district is yet to access that 18 percent.
“My officers and I made a submission to the PEC, who gave their approval and we went to the Mineral Resources Authority with a copy of the resolution. We are just waiting for MRA’s approval and the subsequent release of funds.”
Morobe Governor and chairman of the PEC, Luther Wenge, said he was in the previous government when he made changes to the royalty percentage. He admitted that he felt bad about his decision, so he will make sure Wau-Waria and Bulolo get 9 percent each.
“We have advised the MRA to let these funds come straight to the provincial Treasury so that it can allocate 9 percent to you and 9 percent to Bulolo,” Wenge told Narewec.
“Harmony raised some points to stop the money from coming to us but I told them that ‘you don’t take that money or no Wafi’. We are fighting for you to get the SML.”
Governor Wenge assured Narewec that he will confirm the funding availability and advise him at a later date.","Politics, Anticipation",Politics,Anticipation
ENB economic sector challenged,20/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2306,"The economic sector in East New Britain Province has been challenged to use this year's annual economic sector conference to find solutions to impediments in economic development.
This was the stern message issued by the Pomio MP and Health Minister, Elias Kapavore, when opening the 2024 ENB Economic Sector Annual Conference on November 18th, in Pomio District.
He said this weeklong meeting should not be another avenue to talk about the same things, but rather it should be used by the sector stakeholders to come up with resolutions and innovations to address issues faced by farmers, fishermen and small business operators in the province.
“Next year is an important milestone for PNG. We will celebrate 50 years of our country's political independence. But it’s taking us more than 30 to 40 years to gain economic independence,” Kapavore stated.
After the initial program held last year in Kokopo, Kapavore said it is time to stop talking and start putting into action what has been discussed in the previous meeting.
“Our farmers are struggling out there. They need help. So echoing what the Deputy Provincial Administrator said, by now we should establish monitoring, evaluation, research and quality control systems, to safeguard all these productions in our area.”
Pomio District Administrator, John Liskia, also stressed on the need to chart a new economic development path for the province.
“I think Pomio is the ideal place for the ENBPA to talk about economic development, because Pomio district is a sleeping economic giant,” he said.
He alluded to the fact that Pomio has successfully trialed a number of crops only grown in the highlands part of the country, such as potato, bulb onion, broccoli, coffee as well as rice.
The economic programs being rolled out are in line with the District’s Five Year Development Plan, which is based on the three key pillars of good governance, economic empowerment and integral human development.
“In this conference, I want us to focus on what we can do with the available resources, so to increase the revenue of the province through the economic sector. We need to go into downstream processing of these raw products, and add more value,” Liskia stated.
Liskia also acknowledged the support from political leaders in the province, including Minister Kapavore and members of the Provincial Government, towards the program.
Echoing Minister Kapavore’s remarks on the need for business arms, both for the province and districts to take lead in business ventures, Liskia said these entities should be in the forefront of investment opportunities for the province.
When highlighting on the conference theme ‘Enhancing prosperity through partnership, building a robust and resilient economy’, Deputy Provincial Administrator for Socio-Economic Services (SES), Marakan Uvano, said two key messages can be derived from it.
“Enhancing prosperity is our vision, which is in line with our Strategic Development Plan (2023 - 2033) and the Vision 2050, while the second part on building a robust and resilient economy is our mandate as public servants,” he said.
The conference seeks to provide a valuable platform for effective stakeholder dialogue towards common development goals for economic advancement in the province.
The program is being attended by public servants in the economic sector under the four ENBPA Divisions of Agriculture and Livestock (DAL), Fisheries and Commerce, as well as the Natural Resources Management and Development (NRMD) Unit, from the provincial headquarters right down to the districts and LLGs.
Stakeholders in attendance include the national DAL, NAQIA, NARI, SILAG, KIK, Women and Youth in Agriculture (WYA), PNG Cocoa Board, Commerce Department through the Cooperative Societies Unit, CPL, Growers Association, FPDA, BSP Life Insurance, IRC and Kada Poroman Microfinance Ltd (KPML).","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
PNG regulators’ forum to start Sydney event,20/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2302,"For investors looking to do business in Papua New Guinea, a key understanding of the various regulations are crucial in informing their business decisions.

To take place on Day 1 of PNG Investment Week, which is Sunday December 8th 2024, at the Sydney International Convention Centre.
President of the PNG Chamber of Resources & Energy (PNG CORE), Anthony Smaré, said the decision to have the regulators open PNG Investment Week was strategic, given the need for investors to be aware of regulatory requirements at the outset to provide confidence and assurance for them as they explore investment and trade with PNG.
“The PNG Regulators Forum will begin with the PNG Investment Promotion Authority (IPA) providing an overview of the requirements to for business registration in PNG,” Smaré outlined.
“The IPA will also provide an overview of the various sectors of business in PNG that have seen growth in recent years.
“The Internal Revenue Commission of PNG (IRC) will present on tax registration, compliance and incentives for businesses that want to invest in PNG. This will be crucial given the event will be held immediately after the 2025 national budget is passed.
“PNG Customs Services will provide an overview of the import and export guidelines, whilst the Independent Consumer Competition Commission (ICCC) will provide an overview of rules around business mergers and acquisitions in PNG, which is critical information for potential investors into PNG.
“Furthermore, the regulators from mining (Mineral Resources Authority, and Department of Mineral Policy & Geohazard Management), petroleum (Department of Petroleum), energy (National Energy Authority), and environment (Conservational and Environment Protection Authority) will also present on their respective requirements for doing business in PNG, with a specific focus on each sector.”
Smaré further said for the first time, the event will also feature presentations from the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), National Fisheries Authority (NFA), PNG Tourism Promotion Authority (TPA) and PNG Forest Authority (PNGFA).
“At this stage, the PNG Immigration & Citizenship Authority (ICA) is the only key regulator who has not confirmed participation, however given the importance around ensuring speedy and prompt processing of entry for investors and non-citizens who wish to do business with PNG, we will be hoping that they will be there,” added Smaré.
“The PNG Regulators Forum represents the key state agencies from across a cross-section of PNG’s economy and is a must-attend event for those that are serious in learning more about the dynamic opportunities that exist in PNG and provides an opportunity to hear firsthand from the entities that are directly involved in regulating these sectors.
“We appreciate the support of the Chief Secretary Ambassador Ivan Pomaleu, Deputy Secretary Frank Aisi and the rest of the team at the Prime Minister’s Department for helping us put the Regulators Forum together with such strong participation from our regulators.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

The LDC management is determined to have all groundwork completed by the end of December 2024.
The 68-hectare abattoir has the entire perimeter fence completed, the densely forested areas all cleared and the new staff house nearing completion.
In a status report, Wariman station manager, Giru Hupato reiterated that apart from the clearing of the forest and completion of grubbing works, they have now moved on to final ground works near the old rundown abattoir.
He confirmed that the old rundown facility will be demolished to make way for the new abattoir.
LDC Managing Director, Terry Koim acknowledged the team at Wariman. He shared that such committed officers make for even greater achievements as these are the people on the ground who make things happen.
“It has been tough several months to carry out the groundworks, especially the perimeter fencing which required building trenches for stormwater drainage along the entire boundary using the LDC-owned Excavator which is also used to clear the entire 68 hectares of portion 126, but we have come through and are at the final stages,” he said.
Koim also thanked the policemen who continue to work closely with LDC officers to ensure work is carried out unhindered by outsiders and settlers whilst ensuring no further altercation is caused by locals.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Storage space for Kokopo market vendors,13/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2219,"Vendors at the Kokopo main market, in East New Britain Province will now have access to a new storage facility set up at the market.
The storage facility was commissioned by the ENB Provincial Market Authority (ENBPMA), led by Chief Executive Officer Peter Lapim, on Monday, November 11th.
The event coincided with the opening of the Collector of Public Money (COPM) office at the Rabaul Page Park Market in Rabaul district.
ENBPMA CEO, Peter Lapim, said the construction of both facilities cost around K20,000 and urged his officers to be responsible when operating them.
The storage facility at Kokopo market replaces the old storage cabin which was deemed unhygienic and prone to theft.
“We continue to receive complaints of goods being stolen or not being properly maintained at the yard. With the new facility, we can all be assured that all of our vendors’ goods and products will be properly kept at the storage facility,” Lapim said.
The market has also appointed a staff to oversee the storage facility. His role includes registering all goods and products stored and keeps records of all assets utilised by the officers at the market.
Lapim further urged the officers at the markets to be dedicated to their roles in ensuring that the market runs its daily operations smoothly.
“Whether you’re looking after the toilet or collecting tickets, you all must do your roles with care,” he encouraged.
The Kokopo main market was opened in 2010 and several of its structures are gradually deteriorating. Lapim said the market authority will be doing minor repairs so they will not have to deal with major issues that may halt the operations of the market.
Meanwhile, the old fish market at Rabaul Page Park Market, which housed a kiosk, has been transformed into the new COPM office.
The office is in charge of keeping financial records of revenues collected at the market as well as performing basic accounting roles.
Deputy CEO and Provincial Market Supervisor, Peter Kilang, has commended the authority for approving funds for the construction of the market facilities.
Kilang said both projects will ensure a smooth operation of the markets.
The ENBPMA manages the public markets in Kokopo, Rabaul, Kerevat and Palmalmal in Pomio District.
Kilang also advised that there are plans to set up similar facilities in Kerevat and Palmalmal.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
A cattle farmer’s harsh reality,13/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2215,"Around 70 cattle heads can be seen, grazing peacefully amidst the rolling hills of Erap, in Huon Gulf district.
These cattle belong to the Ubix Farm, owned by one of the few local cattle farmers of Morobe Province.
Allan Artango is one of the few remaining Papua New Guineans who are single-handedly running a cattle farm.
Artango exited formal employment with the then Markham Farming Company in 1994, and started his cattle farm in 1997 with only three heifers. He started breeding his cattle until he had 10 cattle heads the next year, where he entered them into the Morobe Show.
Today, he has a little over 70 cattle heads.
“I’m supposed to have more than that but when I need money to sustain the farm, I would sell them. Or when I have personal needs or have to look after family, I would sell them,” he shared.
“Then there are people who come and steal my cattle. We would report them to police, sometimes the police would step in and help us look for them, other times, we ourselves would go after our cattle, or we would just let it go.”
The skills and knowledge that he is currently using to run the farm were from his days with the Markham Farming Company, which was acquired by New Britain Palm Oil on August 23rd, 2018.
“When I was with the company, I was taught this grazing method where a certain number of herds could feed on 1 hectare of land. I have been utilising that knowledge to manage my herd. So, if it’s 40 hectares, 60 cows can graze there for a minimum of two days before I move them to another area.
“I must rotate them if I have limited land area. My total land area is 114 hectares but only 90 hectares are used for grazing because we need land for our food gardens as well.
“Now that I have 30 horses and over 60 cows, I am already overgrazing so I will need to extend.”
Local farmers like Artango have limited opportunities as well. The only platform that promotes his hard work is PNG’s remaining agricultural show, the Morobe Show.
“We don’t pay fees to, for example, deliver our livestock to the Morobe Show,” said the cattle farmer, whose farm is located almost 2 hours away from Lae city. “The Morobe Show society meets all the costs. We only pay the registration fees for our cows and cowboys to participate in the event.
“Another good thing about the Morobe Show is, even though we participate to just display our livestock, at least they award us with first placing, second, third and ‘most successful exhibitor by smallholder’. At least we get acknowledged and bring something home, like money. This encourages us.
“This year, we received shopping vouchers from Farmset to help us get barbed wires, salt blocks or whatever that our farms require.”
This year, Artango received a K600 voucher for farming supplies, sponsored by Farmset. He was awarded first place in most ribbons won in cattle category at the Morobe Show.
Throughout its 26 years of participation at the Morobe Show, Ubix Farm has scooped a number of accolades, including ‘most successful exhibitor by smallholder’, ‘national champion bull’ and ‘national champion cow’.
With the lack of support and limited opportunities, the number of local farmers has dwindled over the years to just two or three at Erap.
“In the early 90s, I can say that a lot of nationals owned cattle farms,” said Artango. “Sadly, these farms have deteriorated, including large corporate farms in the Markham Valley like Clean Water Cattle Ranch, Zifasing cattle ranch, all these have dropped down.
“The number of cows has dropped, generally, and only Ramu Sugar – because it’s a corporate – owns a large number of cattle. However, I believe they cannot meet PNG’s demand.
“PNG has sufficient land to breed cattle to meet its demand. The industry is dying; we need to revive it.”","Agriculture, Sadness",Agriculture,Sadness
Tourism plan for DOY LLG,08/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2168,"The Kokopo City Authority (KCA) is planning to enhance tourism in one of its rural LLGs in the Duke of York (DOY) group of islands.
Chairman of the KCA Board and Member for Kokopo, Ereman ToBaining Jnr, announced at a recent boat launching in Kokopo that the islanders of Mualim Atoll Ward would be relocated to the Rakanda plantation, on the main island of Romoaina.
He said the KCA Board has approved a paper to purchase 1,000 hectares of the plantation from the Catholic Archdiocese of Rabaul to resettle the people of Mualim Island.
“We will then convert Mualim Island into a tourism destination,” he outlined.
“This is part of our 20-year plan. We are also discussing with the United Church to acquire about 50 to 100 hectares of the Ulu Plantation that is sitting idle. This would be done under a 99-year lease or so, to enable us to bring in development.”
Acting Kokopo District Administrator, Darius Kunai, said the KCA is targeting the coastline of Rakanda and Ulu plantations owned by the two churches to kick off tourism projects on the island LLG.
“The district business arm - Kokopo District Development Corporation (KDDC) - will be driving this initiative.
“It’s (KDDC) already registered and soon we will advertise the position for the manager to come on board and start off these projects. Also, under the tourism program for the LLG, part of the K500,000 for the LLG this year was allocated for the fencing of the Molot Missionary cemetery,” ToBaining Jnr added.
Buried at the cemetery are missionaries from Fiji and others that came to the area with Dr. George Brown.
The DOY Islands LLG consists of the main Romoaina Island, with several smaller islands, including atolls.
The island LLG boasts pristine waters with unique diving spots and other areas for canoeing, fishing, snorkeling, bird watching, picnics, swimming and scenic views for those who wish to do island hopping and sightseeing.","Tourism, Anticipation",Tourism,Anticipation

Undialu Presses Government on Kroton Equity and Santos Pricing,05/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2117,"Hela Governor Philip Undialu has called on Prime Minister James Marape, Petroleum Minister William Duma, and Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) to honour their commitment to release the 4.27% Kroton Equity to the impacted provincial governments and landowner groups.
This follows KPHL’s announcement of the completion of its transaction to purchase an additional 2.6% stake in the PNG LNG Project from Santos Limited for $602 million (K2.18 billion).
Governor Undialu congratulated KPHL on securing the additional equity but raised concerns about the funding source, questioning why KPHL allegedly used $362 million (K1.31 billion) from its revenue tied to the Kroton Equity.
“If the 4.27% Kroton Equity has been set aside as promised, then let us know where it is and when it will be released,” Undialu stated.
Undialu also criticized Santos’ valuation of the 2.6% stake, calling the $602 million (K2.18 billion) price tag excessive, especially given that Santos has likely generated substantial revenue from this stake in recent years.
“I believe Santos has earned over $160 million (K579 million) from this 2.6% stake in the past two years. This amount should have been deducted from the sale price if Santos were genuine in its support for Papua New Guinea,” he added.
Reflecting on the 10-year project life reduction and the initial cost of PNG LNG equity, Undialu argued that Santos’ pricing did not consider the reduced life of the project, noting that a decade ago, the value per percentage point was $240 million (K869 million), whereas today’s rate is $232 million (K839 million) per point.
“Given the returns Santos has already received from the project, it should have offered KPHL a more reasonable price,” Undialu said.
Governor Undialu also referenced the merger between Santos and Oil Search, highlighting that Oil Search’s original acquisition of equity in the Papua LNG Project was funded by a controversial UBS loan that resulted in significant financial loss for PNG.
“Considering these factors, Santos should have shown more consideration for KPHL and the people of Papua New Guinea by offering a fairer price,” he stated.
In closing, Governor Undialu expressed disappointment with the government’s delay in releasing the 4.27% Kroton Equity, which was promised six years ago.
“If the government does not intend to release it, they should be upfront about it rather than keeping host provinces and landowners waiting,” he said.
He called on the government to fulfil its commitment to the people who have contributed significantly to the PNG LNG Project’s success, which recently generated K1.3 billion in taxes.
“Let us be a government that keeps its promises,” Undialu urged.","Politics, Anger",Politics,Anger
KPHL finalizes transaction to acquire extra PNG LNG shares,05/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2115,"Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) has successfully finalised two key transactions that bolster its role in Papua New Guinea’s energy sector: a forward LNG sales agreement with Chevron USA Inc and the acquisition of an additional 2.6 per cent interest in the PNG LNG Project from Santos Limited.
KPHL Managing Director Wapu Sonk announced the completion of the Santos acquisition, which elevates KPHL’s shareholding in the PNG LNG Project to 19.2%, including the Kroton Equity Option shareholding held on behalf of impacted provincial governments and landowner groups.
Sonk emphasised the benefits of this acquisition, noting that with the project’s depreciation expected by the end of 2024 and full repayment of project finance by 2026, the additional equity is set to deliver strong returns for KPHL and enhance its balance sheet.
He added, “This increased stake enables KPHL to further contribute to Papua New Guinea’s energy and petroleum sector and supports nation-building initiatives for the betterment of our people.”
In a related development, KPHL has closed a forward LNG sale agreement with Chevron, which will see Chevron make an advance payment to KPHL in exchange for LNG and condensate cargoes over the next two years. This sale agreement has helped to further KPHL’s goal of acquiring the additional 2.6 per cent equity in the PNG LNG Project.
This agreement follows KPHL’s recent equity marketing initiative, which saw the sale of four LNG cargoes on the spot market earlier this year.
Sonk remarked, “Chevron’s commitment to this deal highlights the value of PNG’s hydrocarbon assets and opens doors for potential future collaboration in LNG and related energy businesses, including carbon offset ventures.”
With these strategic steps, KPHL is positioned to enhance its industry footprint, including preparation for its 22.5% equity stake in the upcoming Papua LNG Project, expected to reach a final investment decision by late 2025.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
Cocoa hub set for Kikori,04/11/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2107,"A major cocoa-producing hub is set to take place in the Gulf region, transforming the Kikori land under an initiative called the Omati Cocoa project.
Landowners in Kikori have agreed to transform their land under this major initiative. Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC) and its subsidiary Gas Resources Pipeline Ltd, received the endorsement of the Cocoa Board of PNG last week to begin distributing seedlings for planting.
G R Pipeline Director, Wauro Oumabe, received two certificates from PNGCB representatives, certifying that the bud wood garden and the nursery at Omati met all the requirements for cocoa seedling cultivation and distribution.
Oumabe reiterated that him and his people are excited and his people have been working on the bud wood garden and nursery for the last three years, testing up to 18 varieties of cocoa to be grown there.
Oumabe represents the Kikori tribes who live along the corridor of the PNG LNG Project pipeline. They are identified as segment 7 pipeline landowners and receive royalty and equity benefits from the PNG LNG project.
“Our oil and gas resources will eventually deplete. What comes next? Where will landowners turn? We must invest in sustainable alternatives. We have decided to invest in agriculture. We are excited about these cocoa projects, and its prospects.”
Since the start of work on the bud wood garden and nursery at Omati, he shared that the interest in growing cocoa has grown, with requests for seedlings coming from Southern Highlands, Baimuru and Kerema.
“We will start in the pipeline corridor area of Omati, Kerewo, Kibiri, Rumu and Barikewa. But there is growing interest (for cocoa) from people in Turama, Gorobe, Baimuru and Ihu. Even Kerema LLG and people in Erave and Kutubu (Southern Highlands) have requested us to supply seedlings.”
People have received training on planting and are now clearing their land and receiving seedlings to grow cocoa in their plots according to Oumabe.
MRDC managing director, Augustine Mano commended director Wauro for getting the cocoa project off the ground.
“The people of Kikori have made the right call to invest in this project. Agriculture is where we must invest our money earned from oil and gas. The wider community benefits and it sustains them over the long term,” Mr Mano said.
He said under the Five-Year Plan being developed with the PNGCB, cocoa a processing facility will be built in Kikori in the 5th year of the plan.","Agriculture, Anticipation",Agriculture,Anticipation

MP Leonard pushes for cocoa,31/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2067,"This month, Alotau, Milne Bay Province played host to the 4th National Cocoa of Excellence Show hosted by the Southern Region.
Member for Samarai-Murua, Isi Henry Leonard, present during the event commented how cocoa is for ordinary Papuan New Guineans who are serious about growing and taking the time to nurture the crop. He said that those who have land, have an opportunity to employ labour to plant cocoa gardens and plantations.
Leonard said cocoa is an important cash crop that continues to stimulate economic activity within the agriculture sector.
“Cocoa is not for the educated elites in cities and elsewhere in the country. Cocoa is for ordinary Papua New Guineans in the villages, this is our job and we must take it up.
“It's about using what we have in the villages, our land and our families to help promote and grow cocoa. Cocoa is logical for us and suits our lifestyle, you can do activities like fishing and still come back and work in your gardens and plantations,” he said.
MP Leonard reminded cocoa farmers and those attending the show to integrate cocoa into their lives and programs.
“The cocoa and agriculture industry are here; the Cocoa Board is here and the market is here to help you venture into this sector.
“The Cocoa Board has confirmed that cocoa grown in the country has an organic taste and flavour and that’s what makes us unique when we export the crop. It is fresh, no chemicals, no pesticides, from nature you draw it and from the garden, you process it to the market.
“We have only one percent in the global market, we need to increase that percentage. The challenge is to increase smallholder cocoa gardens and plantations in order to translate and increase the one percent of the global market. Now with cocoa prices increasing, let us take advantage of this situation,” MP Leonard said.
Reiterating that the demand for high-quality flavoured cocoa was on the rise, and there was a demand from China, India and other emerging markets.
“The high-quality flavoured cocoa is found here in Papua New Guinea, but our production levels are low. Therefore, as smallholders in the country, we must work smart and work together to combine these efforts to increase production so that we can get a fair price when it hits the world market,” he said.
The MP believes the show will inspire the cocoa growers to work together to increase production numbers and in doing so contribute to the country’s economy.
Urging cocoa growers and those in the sector to take up this responsibility to make it work 100 percent because the returns would be high.
MP Leonard said he would support his farmers and officers in the district to increase cocoa production in Samarai Murua District.
He commended the Member for Alotau Rocky Morris and the organisers for the successful staging of the cocoa show, an important event for the agriculture sector.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

EVE Breakfast with a CEO,31/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/2060,"Why does the workplace need more women chief executive officers, this was the question posed on the flyer that introduced a breakfast meeting organized by EVE, held in Port Moresby this week.
Well-known women leaders who had excelled in male-dominated CEO roles were invited to share their experiences with young females.
Dulciana Somare Brash was the keynote speaker, while the other panelists were, Ulato Avei, Lesieli Taviri and Jennifer Baing-Waiko.
Somare said she had never been in the private sector to know how many women are there as CEOs but is aware that women have already broken the barriers and are there.
Some freedoms are exercised in the country and a democracy that has to cater for about 17 millon people, we think, but do we really have proper statistics?
“We can talk about women and we can talk about having women as CEOs in workplaces but if we never work out just the basics; how many women occupy jobs, how many girls went to primary school? How many girl children sit in an elementary school who will have a chance to get into secondary school, and then have an amazing and very privileged opportunity to go to a university? And in the absence of data, we cannot plan,” Brash said.
Waiko who was one of the three panelists, also grew up as a politician’s daughter participating in all obligations of Melanesian political leadership but never imagine to be a leader herself as she recalled.
“It wasn’t something that I aimed for, I didn’t aim to be in that leadership position. It’s inbuilt…. you know each and everyone of you here is also a leader and I’m saying it's important that you speak up and speak out because everyone of us here has a story to share and an inspiration story to share,” Waiko said.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Mape rice growers acknowledged,25/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1981,"The people of Mape, in Morobe’s Finschhafen district, have been recognised for their rice-farming skills.
The Morobe Province Agricultural Society today awarded the Upper Mape rice growers the President’s Award for sustainability and innovation.
Fourteen villages in Upper Mape have been growing rice since it was first taught to them 100 years ago by the early Lutheran missionaries.
Former primary school teacher and Finschhafen woman, Naomi Gioven, and her husband, Henry, have been advocating for Mape rice for a decade now. They finally got the recognition they had been pursuing when they set up their stall in the 2024 Morobe Show last weekend.
“Our people have been growing it and eating it for the past 100 years,” said Naomi.
“The Lutheran missionaries came 200 years ago but our people started cultivating rice for the last 100 years. Next year, they will celebrate their 100th anniversary, or centenary. That’s why we decided to bring the rice out to tell the nation that we can grow our own rice, eat it and sell the surplus at the market just like people selling their banana, kaukau and taro.”
It has taken the people of upper Mape decades to ship samples of their seven rice varieties to Lae because of inaccessibility; rough terrains with no roads or bridges.
Gioven says their farms are 30-40km away from the nearest road. It cost them almost K4,000 to transport their ten 50kg bags of rice from the mountains of Finschhafen to the sea, then via a dinghy to Lae.
“Carriers we paid K200 for one 50kg bag…to carry it to the nearest road. And then PMV down to the coast; another cost. The boat charged us K70 per bag, that’s about 10 bags, K700. We just wanted the bags to come to the show to tell our leaders that we can produce rice.”
President of the Morobe Province Agricultural Society, Hans Mehl, applauded the upper Mape farmers for their dedication as it is in line with this year’s show theme of ‘Sustainable Agriculture – Grow it’.
“People are growing things themselves, propagating food so when I saw their story, I was so impressed we decided to present them with a special award because that’s what we are trying to achieve,” said Mehl at today’s presentation at the Lae Showgrounds.
“We are trying to get people to grow their own food and educate people here; they came all the way from Finschhafen with the product, with the story, with the knowledge and they’re sharing their knowledge. I think that’s the most important thing we want to get across to people.”
The Morobe Show Committee estimated that 36,000 people entered the showgrounds on Saturday, October 19th, while an estimated 45,000 people were at the show on Sunday, October 20th.","Agriculture, Joy",Agriculture,Joy
Lower Siane celebrates first bulb onion harvest,25/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1980,"In a remarkable milestone for the people of Lower Siane in the Chuave District, Simbu Province, the Rural Service Delivery Project (RSDP) has achieved its first successful harvest of A-grade bulb onions.
Over 50 bags of onions, cultivated by a dedicated group of local women and men, have been harvested, stored, and are now ready for distribution to local markets. This achievement signals not only the potential for sustainable agricultural development in the district but also the power of community-led initiatives such as RSDP’s Community-Driven Development (CCD) concept.
The Lower Siane Bulb Onion Project is a collaborative effort supported by various key partners, including the Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs (DPLGA), the World Bank through the International Development Association (IDA), the Australian Government’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the National Government and its local stakeholders.
What makes this initiative particularly notable is that, it is led by the women of 13 wards in Lower Siane, demonstrating the critical role that women play in fostering economic growth and social cohesion in rural communities.
Despite the rugged and remote nature of the Siane LLG, the project has flourished thanks to specialized training provided by the Fresh Produce Development Agency (FPDA). The dedication of the men and women involved, coupled with this expert guidance, has led to a high-quality harvest, with more to come. As RSDP Community Development Worker for Siane LLG, Jacob Kamonai noted, the group of 5-100 members is well-positioned to deliver both in quantity and quality.
Through the community-driven development project, key infrastructure including Cooler Dryer Storage Houses were donated by the FPDA, to ensure that the harvested onions are preserved properly. Furthermore, a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) between Chuave District Development Authority and FPDA has been established to secure the long-term sustainability of the project, focusing on local market supply, continued training and upskilling.
This project embodies the potential of rural communities to create opportunities through proper planning, engagement and self-sustenance. With over 10,000 beneficiaries set to gain from the Lower Siane Bulb Onion Project, this initiative is a powerful example of RSDP’s mission to empower rural communities in Papua New Guinea. The skills learned and shared through this sub-project will leave a lasting legacy for generations to come.","Agriculture, Joy",Agriculture,Joy

Initial talks held for Oil Palm development in Madang,22/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1930,"Madang province was fortunate to have the Minister for Oil Palm, Francis Maneke visit the province yesterday (Monday, 22 October) for discussions around the Oil Palm industry.
The one-day trip saw the provincial government and its administration including stakeholders from the Department of Agriculture and Livestock along with landowners lead dialogue at the Sana room of Madang Resort.
The New Oil Palm Development in Madang will capture:
1.	Proposed 200ha of smallholder Oil Palm Development as an extension by Ramu Agri
2.	10ha nursery development towards Walium Station to support smallholder expansion
3.	Proposed 10-ton tph Oil Palm mill development in the Sogeram Valley
4.	Discussion on the Oil Palm small holder road rehabilitation and maintenance in Ramu Agri, Kesowai
5.	Discussion on the draft national palm oil policy
Whilst welcoming the Minister, Governor Ramsey Pariwa elaborated on the minister’s willingness in coming to Madang for the smallholder’s expansions and further dialogue.
According to the Governor, land is readily available in the Middle Ramu to the Ramu plains which have the potential to become huge oil palm plantations. He further noted that with oil palm, it is high yielding all year round and an economically sustainable crop.
The governor also emphasised on the fact that the industry can create employment for the unemployed population in the province, aligning with the Marape-Rosso government’s target of creating one million jobs by 2027. Further to that, the new land use policy emphasizes on landowners leasing their land to the government, have it registered and returned back as a 99-year lease bankable land.
Kansol Kamdaru, member for Middle Ramu and the assistant speaker of parliament stressed on the fact that agriculture still remains the backbone of the country. His district hosts huge undeveloped land masses which he envisions for Oil Palm plantations within the Special Economic Zone.
97 per cent of land in the country is still owned by Papua New Guineans which makes it hard for government to roll out projects and developments.
Minister Maneke emphasized on landowners selling their land in order to maximize benefit from Oil Palm although this remains the biggest challenge. The reason, being that there are certain laws and regulations in place in the market standard in order for Oil Palm to be bought. If the land is not registered under the government or is cultivated on areas other than savannah, then buyers will not be able to purchase. The minister advised the delegates of the stringent regulations imposed on Oil Palm due to Climate Change in the world.
Sadly, the country does not have any legislations for this industry which Minister Maneke attributed it to “negligence”.
Maneke states that there is more yet to be done to achieve maximum benefit from this industry. Criticizing the Oil Palm Industry Corporation (OPIC), a draft is currently underway for a better policy to be put in place, which will benefit local people.
It was a successful meet, with the Minister and provincial delegates on the same note. Unfortunately, time was not on their side as they had to cancel the site visitations for another trip. It was also noted that landowners will have an audience with the provincial government and planning to discuss on their participation in the industry.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Stronger gold prices to benefit PNG,22/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1929,"Kina Bank says the continued record gold prices will have positive implications for Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) gold export proceeds.
When releasing its September 2024 Economic Update, Kina Bank Managing Director and CEO Greg Pawson said that gold prices reached record historical highs of US$2,600 per ounce in September, and that trend is likely to continue given the uncertainties around the global economic outlook, in particular with the looming U.S elections and on-going Middle-East conflicts.
“During these periods, gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset for investors,” Pawson said.
“In addition, the anticipated rate cuts by the U.S Fed is poised to weaken the U.S dollar. There is a historical inverse relationship between gold and the dollar, so further rate cuts in the next quarter could see gold prices continue to spike. This could have positive implications for PNG’s gold export proceeds.”
The bank also noted that there have been significant improvements in PNG’s foreign exchange (FX) market. The PGK/USD interbank rate continues its downward trend, with the import order book for essential items decreasing by 25% over the past year for Kina Bank.
This improvement is attributed to the Bank of PNG’s consistent intervention levels, with the order book now also including non-essential goods in the import order book. Despite the inclusion of these new orders, waiting times for currency have still reduced from months to around 4-6 weeks.
Meanwhile, PNG Stock Exchange-listed companies involved in the export of key commodities reported very strong half-year profits, driven by high cocoa prices and resilient global equity markets.
“Elevated international cocoa prices and resilient global equity market conditions were some of the key drivers that supported the performance of the local companies. Looking into the second half, we are expecting another strong performance from these companies.”","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

“As we gather here this morning, I want to return our attention to the times we are living in and the climate crisis we are facing. Climate change and its impacts are by now common knowledge, and for those of us in the Pacific, have become existential threat because of rising sea levels and changing weather patterns.

“It is with this backdrop in mind that I emphasize our choices in energy production and consumption, and their far-reaching consequences on future generations because of their direct correlation to the climate crisis.
In the Asia region where economic growth and high populations have placed very high demands on energy consumption, the reliance on coal is the highest worldwide.

PNG to participate in 6-month expo in Japan,17/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1861,"Papua New Guinea will harness the opportunity at the World Expo in Osaka, Japan by securing a commercial space outside of the expo site to promote and market PNG products and services.
Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru announced that PNG will not only have a pavilion at shared pavilion at the World Expo in Osaka, Japan in 2025 but the Government has made a very important decision for PNG to market its products and services.
“The Expo Site will be an artificial island (Yumeshima) and there is a risk of methane gas and more weight may cause the island to sink so the host country is discouraging selling and displaying of products within the Expo Site. Only digital exhibitions will be allowed in the pavilions at the Expo site,” Maru said.
“In the Pacific Pavilion all our provinces, private sector and Government agencies, and the SOEs will only be doing digital exhibitions to market their products and services. That is why our Government has made an important decision to secure a commercial space by providing K3 million funding in principle in the budget for next year to make this possible with the support of our private sector and SOEs.”
“We want to make a bigger impact in the Japanese market and in the world at this Expo so we will be leasing a commercial space outside the Expo Site at the Osaka Bay Area where we can display and sell our products and services and promote PNG as an exciting tourism and investment destination.”
Minister Maru further stated that this allows provinces, districts, private sector and government agencies, and the SOEs to have their booths in the commercial space.
The Expo Secretariat is currently in negotiations with potential service providers in Osaka, Japan, to finalize the lease agreement for 6 months. Once the lease is arranged, a major consultative workshop will be arranged to provide information to all our stakeholders and potential participants on how to secure their booths for the Expo which starts in April 2025.
“They will have to meet some costs to go and advertise and promote their goods and services at the Expo. The participants who would like to advertise digitally must start preparing now and must be willing to pay the fees,” said Minister Maru.
An estimate of 28.2 million visits is projected throughout the Expo with millions to join virtually highlighting the Expo’s international significance and appeal. A total of 150 countries and 25 international organizations are expected to participate.
“This will be the greatest opportunity for us to market and promote our goods and services, and our country, especially in Japan which is a very close and enduring friend of PNG, and a very special friend in terms of trade and economic relationship. They have also been a great donor partner to PNG for many decades,” said Minister Maru.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

“This is all face-to-face communication that we want our employees to have the courage to be involved,” Mr. Francis said.
““In-Direct Communication” is through different medium of communication that we want all our national employees to master and be fluent in terms of corporate communication and knowing how to structure their points in emails, WeChat, WhatsApp and others.
“Through this competition and other activities pre-scheduled, our employees would be able to have the confidence in constructive speaking as well as to maintain body language and posture in their respective departments when communicating,” he added.

Collaboration adds value to degree programs,15/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1847,"Industries are adding value to degree programs by entering into partnerships with tertiary institutions.
PNG University of Technology’s Vice Chancellor, Professor Ora Renagi, outlined this after the recent signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Papua New Guinea Forest Industries Association (Inc).
Prof Renagi said the industries have come to realise the need to support the university to deliver the quality of the degrees that they have always wanted to see.
“I encourage the School of Forestry to embrace the partnership with PNGFIA and through the industry, our students can have firsthand privileges in the professional environment and we begin to address the demand in the industry,” he stated. “Also, we can build capacity in SoF and become a knowledge hub for science and technology in forestry in the next coming years.
“This is a very critical time when we are signing the MoU and I am sure under the leadership of Dr Cossey Yosi and Kanawi Pouru, President of PNGFIA, I am sure there will be opportunities for research and review of the curriculum and continuing to expand the resources to meet the demand that is coming.
“So going forward, I am beginning to realise the potential for universities to be entrepreneurial, meaning we have products to sell. I have always encouraged students to train their minds to build something and sell it as a product.
“The schools under the faculties are also aligning in that direction and together with the industries, we will find our mission to provide opportunities to build incubation centres to sell our products.”
Dr Yosi outlined that the MoU will foster long-term collaboration between the School of Forestry and PNGFIA through education, training and research.
The Memorandum of Understanding, which was signed on Friday, August 30th, will enable PNGFIA to:
•	Provide professional work experience training for Year 3 and Year 4 students of the School of Forestry;
•	Coordinate a cadetship training program for the students;
•	Facilitate the formation of an Industry Advisory Board; and,
•	Allow PNGUoT to provide training to staff of Forest Industry to upgrade their qualifications.","Education, Anticipation",Education,Anticipation
Path paved for forestry students,15/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1846,"The path of the PNG University of Technology students into the forestry sector has been paved following the signing of a deal with the Papua New Guinea Forest Industries Association (Inc).
The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which was signed on Friday, August 30th, will enable PNGFIA to:
•	Provide professional work experience training for Year 3 and Year 4 students of the School of Forestry;
•	Coordinate a cadetship training program for the students;
•	Facilitate the formation of an Industry Advisory Board; and,
•	Allow PNGUoT to provide training to staff of Forest Industry to upgrade their qualifications.
Head of School, Dr Cossey Yosi, said the forest industry has been collaborating with the School of Forestry for over 30 years to support students’ field trips to selected timber companies and award prizes for academic excellence for students. However, due to COVID-19, from 2019 up to now, PNGFIA had minimised its support. The signing of this MoU will now strengthen this longtime partnership.
“The signing of the MoU will also pave the way for the PNGUoT to work with the timber industry and PNG Forest Authority to address the Government directives to the forestry sector and assist in addressing the major challenges facing the forestry sector,” said Dr Yosi.
“These are: Reducing export of round logs to 50 percent by 2025; improve downstream processing so that 80 percent of PNG timbers are produced domestically by 2030; PNGFA to establish up to 800,000 hectares of forest plantations by 2050; and Forestry to contribute to the generation of around 70 percent of GDP.”
The MoU is part of the current structural academic changes within the University. Those changes include the renaming of the 13 academic departments into schools which are grouped into five faculties. The School of Forestry (SoF) is under the Faculty of Natural Resources.
SoF alone caters to three campuses: Taraka Campus, Bulolo University College (BUC) and Timber and Forestry Training College (TFTC).
SoF is benchmarking its undergraduate degree programs to meet international standards.
The benchmarking team, which is led by Professor Yusuf Sudo Hadi, is undertaking a comprehensive review of the undergraduate courses offered at the School of Forestry.
The benchmarking team has completed collecting benchmarking-associated information in six international universities to see those courses similar to what SoF offers. After the completion of this process, SoF is now ready to benchmark its undergraduate courses with the University of Canterbury (UC) in New Zealand (NZ).
Furthermore, SoF is now collaborating with specialised personnel involved in benchmarking from UC therefore, the benchmarking team will soon submit a report for auditors at UC in NZ to assess before inviting their team from UC to visit SoF.
The benchmarking of programs offered in SoF is an improvement from the 2019 implementation of a new curriculum of four subjects per semester to meet the requirements of the Papua New Guinea National Qualification Framework (PNG NQF).
PNG NQF is a system of formal qualifications for tertiary education in PNG.","Education, Trust",Education,Trust
A win for PNG’s food industry,15/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1843,"Food testing can now be conducted in country following the accreditation of the National Food Testing and Monitoring Centre (NFTMC) at the PNG University of Technology in Lae, Morobe Province.
It is a fully accredited food testing laboratory under the ISO/IEC17025 international standard.
The Head of School of Applied Sciences, Dr Lydia Yalambing, said this is a significant milestone, not only for the school, but for the partners and stakeholders involved as well.
“The Accreditation of NFTMC is a testament to our unwavering commitment to our excellence in food safety, and quality standards,” she stated.
“Elevates our capacity to conduct high quality research and provides our students and staff in the school and university with access to some of the cutting-edge technologies and methodologies in food analysis and monitoring.
“This advancement will not only benefit the academic community at the university, but also boosts and strengthens the capabilities of the food industry in ensuring that our sea food products meet the stringent requirements of international markets such as the EU markets and the emerging opportunities in China and elsewhere.”
Dr Yalambing acknowledged the National Fisheries Authority (NFA) as a key partner that has supported NFTMC’s journey, describing the partnership as a “cornerstone of this success”.
The NFTMC is the result of a partnership that was forged in 2014, with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between PNGUoT’s Applied Science Department (now the School of Applied Science) and the National Fisheries Authority.
Work on establishing the NFTMC was officially launched in 2018, followed by a revised MoU that was signed in December 2022.
The NFTMC’s objectives under the MoU were to become a fully accredited food testing laboratory, to provide analytical testing services to meet national and international importing country requirements and to maintain the accreditation status through continual improvement.
Following the signing of the revised MoU, the chemistry and microbiology laboratories were partitioned to cater for highly sensitive lab equipment; and an initial accreditation assessment was carried out on 12th – 13th of December in 2023.
A total of 26 analytical test reports were issued to NFA as the partner in Lae, Madang and Wewak in 2023.
In February this year (2024), NFTMC commissioned the two laboratories, equipment, renovated facilities, and vehicle donated by the NFA.
Vice Chancellor Professor Ora Renagi expressed his delight at the results of the PNGUoT and NFA partnership, saying PNGUoT will continue to support this development.
Dr Yalambing said this partnership exemplifies how academia and industry can work together to achieve common goals to benefit society and the economy at large.
NFTMC’s accreditation to the international standard elevates its credibility to produce reliable analytical test results. Companies and organisations that require analytical testing to be carried out in an accredited laboratory now can use NFTMC for their analytical needs.
NFTMC’s Manager, Justin Narimbi, said apart from servicing the fisheries sector, NFTMC is open to provide analytical testing to other food/feed industries and commodity sectors.
NFTMC’s current scope of accreditation include; Histamine in Foods/Feeds by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and Various Microbiological Analysis in Foods and Water (Total Plate Count), total coliforms, faecal coliforms, E.coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Enterococci.
“NFTMC can also carry out additional analytical testing such as proximate analysis, macro and micronutrient analysis, vitamins and trace metals analysis in food/feeds,” Narimbi stated.
“It can also carry out analytical testing on water and wastewater samples for various physicochemical parameters. While these additional testing are not included in the current scope of accreditation, they will be added soon.”
Narimbi added that the technical staff of NFTMC and the School of Applied Sciences worked hard in achieving this accreditation milestone, and demonstrated great professionalism in their work.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
ICCC to prosecute 11 shops,15/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1842,"The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) will prosecute 11 shops in New Ireland Province for increasing their prices above 10 percent without prior approval.
Out of 32 shops inspected, 11 shops were issued with an Infringement Notice (IN) for failing to comply with the Price Control Measure No. 4.
These shops have been given 14-days if they choose to appeal the IN that was issued by the ICCC. In the appeal, these shops are to justify their reasons for increasing the prices of certain goods sold or pay a K10,000 fine for non-compliance. Failing this, they will be taken to court by the ICCC.
During ICCC's nationwide price measure exercise carried out in the province recently, it was recorded that 11 shops in Kavieng and Namatanai districts were found to have increased prices of certain goods listed in Schedule 1 of the Price Measure No.4 above 10 percent without seeking prior approval from the ICCC.
ICCC Commissioner and chief executive officer, Paulus Ain who was on the ground welcomed and acknowledged concerns by shop owners about price increases at the suppliers and wholesalers end however, cautioned them to always apply to the ICCC before increasing their prices of the scheduled goods.
Ain noted the retail prices for flour, cooking oil, laundry soap and sugar remained steady (reasonably flat) when the base price was collected last year during Phase 1. However, the prices for rice have been increasing gradually and it is a concern.
Ain is warning shop owners who pretend to comply with the Price Order during the price inspection exercise that this is an ongoing exercise and if they are caught, they will be penalised.
""Let this be a warning to all the shop owners that ICCC will not hesitate to penalise any shop that increases its prices of certain goods per Schedule 1 without applying to the ICCC before increasing the prices,” Ain warned.
He added that those shops in other centers yet to be visited by the ICCC must seek approval for any price increase now to avoid being penalised.
ICCC has applauded the other shop owners for being compliant and keeping their prices at a reasonable level despite the current inflationary pressure experienced in the country.","Business, Anger",Business,Anger

Farmer Represents PNG at World Food Day,15/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1829,"A young farmer from East Sepik, Papua New Guinea, is making waves internationally with his digital innovation in agriculture.
Nicodemus Mainga, 39, from Mandi Village, Wewak District, represented Papua New Guinea at the Regional World Food Day event organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Bangkok.
He was one of four ""Young Innovators"" selected to showcase their work in agriculture, emphasizing the power of e-commerce and youth leadership in rural communities.
Nominated by FAO under the EU-STREIT PNG Programme, Nicodemus leads Mongs AgTrade Services Limited, a small agri-business focused on vanilla bean production and sales.
During his presentation, he highlighted how digital platforms and training provided by FAO and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) helped his team create an online marketplace, securing international buyers for their vanilla beans.
“Our first e-market export was worth $5,500 (K20,075) to a buyer in Australia, and we’ve since formed partnerships in Canada, Singapore, and Malaysia,” Nicodemus said.
This digital leap has significantly boosted their community’s income, positioning Mongs AgTrade as a reputable vanilla exporter.
The EU-STREIT PNG Programme has been instrumental in providing internet access and digital skills training through resource centres in the Sepik region, enabling farmers like Nicodemus to harness the power of technology.
Programme Coordinator Ali Yesuf praised Nicodemus for setting an example for other communities to follow, underscoring the importance of digital innovation in achieving sustainable agricultural development.

Reaching the Unbanked with BSP’s Cash Agent Initiative,12/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1803,"The BSP Financial Group's Cash Agent Commissioning initiative is making strides in expanding banking services to remote and underserved communities in Papua New Guinea.
Through strategic partnerships with local businesses and individuals, known as cash agents, BSP is extending its reach beyond traditional branch networks to provide essential banking services such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
The initiative benefits small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), allowing them to serve as cash agents and earn commissions while offering a convenient banking option to their customers.
This partnership supports the growth of SMEs by giving them an additional revenue stream, boosting financial inclusion for entrepreneurs in rural and semi-urban areas who may otherwise have limited access to banking infrastructure.
BSP Mt. Hagen Branch Manager, Theresa Pilamp, who has been with the bank for 35 years, has played a key role in promoting this initiative. She highlighted the positive impact it has had on her community.
“Many citizens are now able to access banking services more easily, and we’ve seen SMEs grow as they take on the role of cash agents,” Pilamp explained.
In describing the process of selecting and training cash agents, Pilamp said, “Our customers must have been with BSP for over 12 months, have good credit facilities and a solid account history.
By enabling SMEs to act as cash agents, we’ve helped reduce the long queues at our branches while also giving ownership of banking services to our SMEs.”
BSP supports its cash agents by providing financial literacy training and other resources to help them succeed. The bank’s commitment to the community is further demonstrated through its SME support programs, offering low interest rates and facilitating cash agent operations.
“Cash agents allow store owners, who often handle large sums of money, to use their cash to assist customers. Instead of queuing up at the bank, customers can now use cash agents for quick transactions,” Pilamp added.
The initiative has garnered positive feedback from both cash agents and customers. Pilamp shared that cash agents have seen significant growth in their businesses.
""They feel empowered as they serve customers who no longer want to wait in line, and in return, they are rewarded with commissions based on the number of customers they serve,"" she said.
""The Highlands region, in particular, has seen an increase in cash agents who are helping reduce queues at our branches.""
In terms of financial inclusion, the Cash Agent Commissioning initiative has made a noticeable impact in rural areas. “We have cash agents in the most remote areas, like Moosa, and we provide literacy training to surrounding communities. We’re looking to establish even more cash agents in the most remote parts of the country so people don’t have to travel to towns to access banking services,” Pilamp explained.
One such success story is Ruth Yank, a widow and entrepreneur who recently launched her own cash agent office with the support of BSP. Yank, a loyal BSP customer for over 20 years, operates several businesses, including a hotel. Her customer base has grown significantly, and she now uses her business to assist customers who would otherwise face long queues at ATMs.
""Ruth has been a faithful customer and a great example of how this initiative can empower individuals to contribute to their communities,"" Pilamp said.
""She’s not just serving customers, she’s working with government departments like health and education to offer a comprehensive service.""
As BSP continues to expand its Cash Agent Commissioning initiative, it remains focused on increasing access to banking services in remote and underserved areas.
“We’re ready to support anyone interested in becoming a cash agent, particularly in the Western Highlands and other rural areas,” Pilamp concluded.
The Cash Agent Commissioning initiative represents a promising future for financial inclusion in Papua New Guinea, bringing essential banking services closer to the people who need them most.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Porgera operations suspended,12/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1801,"Porgera Mine in Enga Province has run out of fuel to sustain its operations, thus shutting down indefinitely until further notice.
An internal memo to staff from the General manager of New Porgera Limited, James McTieran was leaked and is doing its rounds on the social media.
McTieran in this memo stated that the ongoing disruptions to fuel transfer operations at Mulitaka and roadblocks along the Highlands Highway have led to a shortage of fuel to sustain operations at the mine.
Since the re-opening of the mine in December 2023, it was not a walk in the park for New Poregra Limited. They had to cope with a lot of setbacks, starting with the landslide at Mulitaka in May which affected their fuel supply, to the escalation of law and order problems in September which led to a temporary suspension of the operations and now a shortage in fuel to sustain its operations.
Videos and photos shared on Facebook in the last couple of days showed locals demolishing a bridge that leads to Porgera, fuel tankers bound for Porgera being blocked off at Mulitaka and trucks being burnt.
It is believed that these are the causes of fuel not being able to reach the mine, leading to the New Porgera management announcing a suspension of its operations.
While NPL is yet to release an official statement, the screen shot of the internal memo has been confirmed to be valid where the General Manager, James McTieran announces the suspension.
McTieran in that memo said the mine’s diesel inventory has become insufficient to sustain operations, as a result they began shutting down the remaining mining equipment on the evening of October 11th.
It is believed that employees are still on the ground as the memo calls for employees to continue reporting to work as scheduled.
The memo further informed employees that authorities are working to restore access to Porgera.
TVWan News reached out to the Assistant Police Commission for Western End, Jospeh Tondop but is yet to receive a response.

Porgera CDA initialed,11/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1792,"The Porgera Community Development Agreement has made progess with the first four parties to the agreement initialing the draft CDA on Wednesday, October 9 after six months of negotiations. The initialing ceremony took place at the Hilton Hotel in Port Moresby.
The four are the Special Mining Lease (SML) landowners (excluding two agents), who initialled the CDA document as representatives of their individual clans, the Porgera Urban Local Level Government, the Porgera Rural Local Level Government and the State.
According to a statement from the Mineral Resource Authority (MRA), the other two parties New Porgera Limited (NPL) and the Enga Provincial Government (EPG) did not attend the occasion and have given their reasons which cannot be disclosed.
It stated that the State will continue to have dialogue with these two parties and is confident of reaching a consensus.
The draft CDA documents that have been initialed will go through the government vetting process, especially clearance on the fiscal and monetary terms and the legal aspects of the agreement.
This will be done by the Department of Treasury and the Office of the State Solicitor respectively. After the legal clearance is given by the Office of the State Solicitor, the document will go to the National Executive Council (NEC) for deliberation and endorsement after which, the parties will implement their various undertakings in the agreement.
Major clauses in the draft CDA which the Department of Treasury will look at are the equity and royalty break-ups between SML landowners, non-SML landowners and the EPG.
Under the Porgera Project Commencement Agreement (PPCA) which was signed between Barrick, SML landowners, EPG and the State, the equity break-up is as follows:
SML landowners 5%, EPG 2.5%, Non SML 2.5%, Mineral Resources Enga (MRE) 5%. This adds up to 15 % equity out of the total 51 % owned by PNG parties.
The balance of 36 percent is owned by Kumul Minerals Holdings Limited (KMHL) on behalf of the State.
In terms of royalties, the PPCA provides for a total of 3 percent royalty of which, 2 percent goes to the SML landowners, 1 percent to EPG and the other 1 percent to others (non SML, riverine, Mining Lease, Lease for Mining Purposes).
The SML landowners have however, proposed their own break-up of equity and royalties, and a plan on their business development aspirations. These proposals will be attached with the draft CDA to the NEC for decision making.
CDA is a benefit sharing agreement whereby the National government shares benefits from mining projects with the host Provincial Government Local Level Governments and Landowners as required by law.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Founded by the late Justice Regina Sagu, RSF is based in Port Moresby but has begun establishing its operations in Wabag, Enga province as of June 2024.
RSF has conducted Gender Based Violence sensitization awareness training for staff and teachers in schools, starting with Kopen Secondary, and is now focused on women in SME.
The organization’s main interest is integrating financial literacy into their existing programs to empower SME women and market management in Wabag, responding to a strong demand for financial training.
Their work in Wabag has also  identified an urgent need to equip women with financial skills, particularly given the region’s vulnerability to natural and social-ethnic challenges.
RSF’s aim is to support SME women and market vendors in Wabag by empowering them to better manage and grow their business, ultimately helping them transition from the informal economy to the formal financial economy.
Executive Director of CEFI,  Saliya Ranasinghe during the signing ceremony on Friday 4th October, thanked RSF for reaching out to CEFI to conduct the training, adding this important partnership will go a long way in benefiting women SME’s to improve their knowledge and skills in financial literacy.
“It's encouraging to see that your organisation is giving prominence to parting this knowledge to the community groups whom you are working with. I'm sure that it's going to change the lives of the people for the future,” said Ranasinghe.
“Changing mindsets is important and I hope that the partnership that we are establishing today will take us through this transformation process and to make this place a better place for the younger generation of this country.
Ranasinghe encouraged RSF to invite banks when conducting the financial literacy training to open bank accounts and also do an evaluation after a year of doing the training to see the impact it has in changing people’s lives.
In response Grace Ma’ai, RSF Acting Director and President thanked CEFI for the promptness in progressing the MoU signing to commence the training.
Ma’ai emphasised the MoU signifies hope in the communities RSF works with especially in Wabag empowering women and youths, sporting groups, school and educational institutions and SME women.
“This partnership is a big step forward for RSF and its communities and we look forward also to working together with CEFI,” said Ma’ai.
“We (RSF) are self-funded and open to activities that will enhance and help our communities to bring better economic resilience and reduce poverty to the community,” she added.
RSF partnership with CEFI will see the following deliverables;
Training the trainers, RSF enabling them to independently deliver financial literacy programs as part of their ongoing GBV sensitization workshops, provide certified financial literacy training to over 1000 men, women and youths from SMEs in Wabag and expand their capacity building efforts beyond Wabag, and potentially into Telefomin, Sandaun Province in the future.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
Women encouraged to embrace economic challenges,10/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1773,"In a significant development at Ramu NiCo's mining project areas, women representatives from key associations of Basamuk, Maigari, and the Coastal Pipeline Women’s Associations, were elected to executive positions – a crucial step towards gender inclusivity and empowerment within the mining community.
Ramu NiCo allocates a portion of royalties from the total component to women associations operating within the four project areas situated along its mining corridors. This financial support fosters the participation and uplifting of women in regions closely linked to Ramu NiCo’s operations.
Emphasizing the importance of financial prudence and sustainability, Albert Tobe, Ramu NiCo’s Deputy General Manager Community Affairs, encouraged the newly elected women executives to judiciously utilize the funds received from the company.
Mr. Tobe emphasized on the significance of making the most of the allocated resources, especially in the face of economic challenges currently affecting Papua New Guinea.
The female leaders would take on their roles, manage the funds effectively and explore avenues for long-term growth and community impact.
The election of these women representatives signifies a step towards greater gender equality and empowerment within the mining industry, reflecting a growing recognition of the vital role that women play in community development and decision-making processes.
As these leaders embark on their new responsibilities, it is hoped that they will leverage the resources at their disposal to drive positive change and sustainable progress within their respective communities.
The empowerment of women within the framework of Ramu NiCo's mining projects not only highlights the company's commitment to social responsibility but also sets a valuable precedent for inclusive practices in the corporate sector.
The newly elected women executives now stand as torchbearers of progress, entrusted with the task of utilizing financial resources for the greater good and enduring prosperity of their communities.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy

• Legacy issues of its operations impact on the Ok Tedi and Fly River systems and the communities that depend on them.
Despite these challenges, OTML continues to remain resilient and has operated successfully by providing economic and social benefits to Western Province and Papua New Guinea over the last 40 years. They include:
• K13.4 billion in Dividends;
• K1.4 billion in Royalties;
• K10.2 billion in Tax/Duties;
• K1.6 billion in Compensation;
• K1 billion in CMCA Payments;

Wau-Waria celebrates butchery graduates,09/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1759,"Wau-Waria district, in Morobe Province, has celebrated another milestone through the graduation of 19 young men from the Madang Butchery Program.
This graduation emphasises the district’s focus on transforming the unskilled to skilled, the uneducated to educated, and the unemployed to employed.
At today’s graduation, held at the Lae International Hotel, it was alluded that when the youth population of a country is greater than that of the old ones, this is called a youth bulge, or youth bubble.
A report by Oaktree, Australia’s largest youth-run organisation, outlined that the youth bulge is a serious development challenge for Papua New Guinea that directly affects service delivery, human development, governance and security.
The National Research Institute drew attention to school leavers and university graduates “who are unable to make a meaningful contribution through honest or legitimate paid work”.
Morobe’s new electorate of Wau-Waria – a once-neglected Local Level Government of Bulolo district – is addressing this through education and training for its younger population.
“All credit must go to the honourable Member for Wau-Waria and his team for all their efforts that they’re doing to empower the youth, to make sure the youth don’t turn to crime, are gainfully employed and get opportunities too in education,” said Australia’s Consul-General in Lae, Mark Foxe.
“And of course, the Australian government is heavily invested in labour mobility, Pacific labour mobility. And you might have heard of a program called Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) whereby we provide opportunities for employment for young men and women around the Pacific and also Timor Leste, to work in Australia in a variety of industries.
“And for those who are here today, who have graduated into butchery, it’s interesting to know that some 39 percent of all the labour people that are working in Australia at the moment are in meatwork.”
Local MP, Marsh Narewec, stressed that his vision is to make Wau-Waria great again. This means giving the youth the opportunity to be self-sustaining and to bring money back into their local economy.
“We have to find a way to bring you guys into the system and save you so you can have opportunities too,” he told the graduates, who have been away from home for 4 months under the butchery program.
“That’s why we have come up with this program. This program was not established under the government system; I initiated this as your Member to create opportunities for you.”
The District Development Authority is working on the graduates’ passports and visas. In the meantime, Pelgen’s Ltd will be hiring some of the graduates, while other work opportunities will be secured for the others.","Development, Joy",Development,Joy

Fuel prices drop for October,08/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1732,"Fuel prices for October have dropped, according to the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC). These prices take effect today, Tuesday, 8th October 2024.
For this month, the Indicative Retail Prices (IRPs) for petrol, diesel and kerosene will decrease on average, throughout Papua New Guinea. The price decreases are mainly attributed to lower oil demand in China and increased production from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies.
The domestic retail fuel prices for this month are inclusive of the Import Parity Prices (IPPs) or the imported costs for each petroleum product, domestic sea and road freight rates for the third quarter of 2024, the annual wholesale and retail margins for 2024, and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), including the applicable excise duties, among other parameters.
As a result of adding all the various cost components stated above, the maximum retail price movements for petrol, diesel and kerosene in Port Moresby will decrease as follows:
•	Petrol (tpl) –
K4.18,
•	Diesel (tpl)
K3.88, and
•	Kerosene (tpl)
K3.62.
Retail prices in all other designated centers will change according to their quarterly approved domestic freight rates for the fourth quarter of 2024, and their respective annual retail margins for this year. For all other centers, the maximum retail prices for each regulated petroleum product will all change on average as follows:
•	Petrol prices will decrease by
16.67
toea per litre;
•	Diesel prices will decrease by
19.73
toea per litre; and
•	Kerosene prices will decrease by
18.77
toea per litre.
As part of the ICCC's enforcement and compliance of fuel prices, their Investigation Officers will conduct inspections of all service stations to ensure prices of declared petroleum products comply with the allowable maximum prices.
The prices set by the ICCC are the indicative maximum retail prices, for which retailers may choose to sell below the ICCC-approved maximum price.
Whilst retailers may choose to set fuel prices on their pumps to one decimal place, the ICCC will continue to set the maximum price to 2 decimal places. No fuel pump operator should charge above the Indicative Retail Price for this month's price regardless of the number of decimal places.
This is to ensure compliance with the Prices Regulation Act under which the maximum prices of declared petroleum products are set. Retailers who are displaying prices to 1 decimal place are urged by the ICCC to round the prices down to ensure prices are within the allowable indicative retail prices.
ICCC states that Inspectors will continue to conduct spot checks after 8th October 2024, to ensure ongoing compliance by retail fuel operators.
Consumers are advised by ICCC to report any instances of overcharging by retailers.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
Day old chicks on high demand,07/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1722,"Day old chicks are currently on high demand in the market.
Zenag’s sales and marketing supervisor, Paul Drua, outlined this during the Women's Economic Empowerment Expo 2024 that was held last week in Lae, Morobe Province.
One of the business houses that set up at the Eriku Oval, from Thursday, October 3rd, to Saturday, October 5th, was Zenag Chicken. Zenag is a family-owned poultry manufacturer based in Morobe Province, and is currently the country’s major distributor for chicken, eggs and day old chicks, or DOC.
“DOC, currently in the market, it’s very demanding,” said Drua. “A lot of men and women want to have poultry farms to produce eggs and also, meat, to sell and consume. It is a source of protein for their daily meals.
“We are happy to support chicken farming. It’s not that we are only interested in selling products, we are also sharing information to make sure people know how to manage the products that we distribute.”
Zenag Chicken has a number of distributors nationwide, such as Chemica and Farmset Ltd. These are outlets that customers can purchase Zenag products.
Drua outlined that around K2,000 should be budgeted to set up a chicken farm.
“Lately we’ve been doing research and we have noted the unsteady prices of DOC in the market,” Drua outlined. “We have seen that demand is high and sometimes companies increase their prices.
“Our research from a few months ago estimated the cost at K1,800 to get stockfeed and a carton of DOC from Zenag. That cost is for the setup. To get stockfeed, chicken, drinkers and feeders, you’ll need around K1,800-K2,000.”
The Women's Economic Empowerment Expo 2024 is Lae’s first-ever largest expo for women.
At the expo, Zenag provided training materials, knowledge-sharing sessions and insights from their decades of experience in the food industry to attendees.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Facilitated by the Lae SME Incubator Hub and supported by the Small and Medium Enterprise Corporation, small businesses and women’s groups were able to register, free of charge, for stalls at the Eriku Oval.
Dang Dai, who hails from Lababia village, in Salamaua, and from Finschhafen is with the Our Savour’s Lutheran Church women’s group called ‘Marima’.
This is their first time to be part of a city exhibition, with Dai saying they have only sold their ‘kolos’, bilums and arts and craft within church premises.
“We mostly do our small craft marketing within the church area,” she said.
“We have done this three times in our church but to come out here since Thursday has been a new experience for us. We witnessed women utilising the gifts God gave them to create something. I was blessed to see this. It is also my first time to be involved with such a group and I am happy with whoever is in charge, who made this possible.
“I saw the women here and their setups and I am grateful for the experience.”
Leah Panasa, whose husband passed away a few years ago, is a primary school teacher. Her late husband helped her develop the passion to use her hands to come up with beautiful arts and crafts. With the help of family members, she constructed a brick outdoor stove and flower vases to sell at the expo.
She has not registered her SME yet, but she appreciated the exposure she had at the event.
“I saw the arts and crafts on display by other women and that piqued my interest,” she said. “I believe that the next time this program is hosted, I will be part and parcel of it.”
Aside from SMEs, business houses like Zenag, Badili Hardware, Raumai 18 and Paradise Foods also set up booths.

Working with cooperatives a priority,04/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1688,"Madang Governor Ramsey Pariwa, says working with cooperative societies in the province will be the way forward for him, and not individuals.
Governor Pariwa explained that working with organized groups such as cooperative societies would see wider participation and more shared benefits in the rural communities.
Furthermore, working with organized groups would have the advantage of bargaining power for price and would assist in cost sharing amongst the rural farmers.
Commerce Division acting director Imason Bekue introduces the meeting to Governor Pariwa
Mr. Pariwa highlighted his intension last week when he met with 48 heads (chairmen) of primary cooperative societies who represented over 80, 000 rural farmers from the six districts of Madang, namely Bogia, Sumkar, Middle-Ramu, Madang, Raicoast and Usino-Bundi.
The meeting was organized by the Commerce Division of the Madang Administration following a request from the primary cooperative societies to have an audience with governor Pariwa.
Acting director of the Madang Commerce Division, Imason Bekue explained that the chairmen of the primary cooperatives in Madang had been meeting for weeks in Madang town to gather data and he is grateful that governor Pariwa made time available to meet them personally and to explain to them the Provincial Government’s economic plans for the province.
Mr. Pariwa at the meeting, said he would ensure that more cooperatives are formed and all its members attend financial literacy trainings to better equip themselves to conduct commercial agri-businesses.
The governor told the group that his government would be focusing more on agriculture, livestock and fisheries, particularly in the primary sector and in rural districts of the province.
Mr. Pariwa thanked the officers from the Madang Commerce Division who have been committing their time to conducting financial literacy trainings to upskill rural farmers to advance into commercial business, and importantly teaching the farmers discipline on how to save and use their hard-earned income wisely to sustain their socio-economic livelihood.
He said although he is not a businessman, the basic principles he had attained through literature is that whatever income that any person earns must be saved, and others be utilized wisely to grow and sustain their business.","Politics, Trust",Politics,Trust
MSME study launched in Lae,04/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1686,"The major obstacle that hinders the growth of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) in Papua New Guinea is government corruption, followed by government regulation, political instability, tax rates and law and order.
These were some of the findings listed in the ‘PNG Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise and Informal Sector Study’ that was launched in Lae on Thursday afternoon.
This landmark study was commissioned by the Australian Government, through the Australia PNG Economic Partnership, which covered more than 2,600 businesses across 21 provinces. The only province that was excluded was Enga due to security issues.
“When we did the study, we conducted the field work across seven weeks, from June to July in 2024,” outlined the CEO of Tebbutt Research, Caz Tebbutt.
“It’s always challenging, having teams go out because we covered all of the provinces of Papua New Guinea except Enga. And we also covered urban, rural and remote areas so most of the challenges are around access, particularly the conditions of the roads.”
The report outlined that government corruption is the major obstacle faced by small businesses, putting it at 69 percent, followed by government regulation, political instability, tax rates, and law and order.
“When we asked people about obstacles, what we found was that there are a lot of obstacles for business. There are some that we consider to be in the regulatory environment, for example, the regulations of government or of government corruption, and issues to do with stability and law and order as well.
“When businesses are operating, they do have their own challenges in their businesses but they also face the challenges that are in the country overall as well.
“Probably, one of the most important findings was that business owners really want to be heard. They want to have a voice. They want to participate in the development of policy and decisions about the things in their sector that affect them.
“They know what their challenges are, they also know what is working really well for them.
“There’s a lot of positive results in the study as well but the main thing is to talk to people. If you want to know what people think, ask them.”
The report noted that access to finance remains a key barrier to growth, and has suggested that the adoption of especially digital financial services may help to ease cashflow constraints.

PM sets Wafi-Golpu deadline,02/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1656,"Prime Minister James Marape has underscored the urgency of finalising the Mine Development Contract (MDC) and issuing the Special Mining Lease (SML) for the Wafi-Golpu Mine in Morobe Province.
He stressed that time is running out to get this critical project off the ground.
During a high-level meeting with the State Negotiating Team, Joint Venture Partners Newmont and Harmony, Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso, and Mining Minister Wake Goi, Prime Minister Marape emphasised the importance of immediate action.
“Time is ticking away. As a nation, we have collectively agreed that the Wafi-Golpu project must move forward on terms that are in line with our laws and policies, especially those that ensure the State and Papua New Guinea secure 55 percent of the project’s economic benefits,” he stated.
“I am pleased that the Framework Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which was signed in 2023, honours this commitment. The project contains over 12 million ounces of gold and three million tonnes of copper. It is a significant undertaking expected to extend beyond 60 years. However, we have agreed to a 40-year lease, contingent on the joint venture partners commencing the project within two years of the SML issuance.”
Reflecting on past delays, Prime Minister Marape lamented the significant time lost due to legal proceedings and reiterated that further delays were no longer an option.
“I want to make it absolutely clear: we cannot afford to lose any more time. The Wafi-Golpu project must advance without further delay. This is a project of national importance, and moving forward on key milestones is critical to the country’s economic progress.”
The Prime Minister set a firm deadline, stating that the MDC and SML for Wafi-Golpu must be finalised before the 2024 Papua New Guinea Investment Week, which is scheduled to take place in Sydney, Australia, from December 6-11.
“The Framework MoU signed in 2023 is our roadmap, and it is time to act,” he added.
Prime Minister Marape also highlighted the need to respect the patience of landowners and the Morobe Provincial Government, represented by Governor Luther Wenge, who have waited for years to see the project begin.
“We cannot continue to hold them in suspense. Delaying any further will only invite frustration and discontent from landowners and local authorities,” Prime Minister Marape warned.
Key provisions under the Framework MoU include:
•	The State and Papua New Guinea receiving 55 percent of the project’s economic returns.
•	State equity set at 30 percent, with 10 percent carried, and Morobe Province and the landowners receiving the carried equity.
•	A fiscal stability tax at 2 percent, in addition to a 30 percent full tax.
•	Royalty set at 3 percent with no deductions.
•	An additional US$394 million committed by Newmont and Harmony for social and community infrastructure, supplementing the Government’s K1.2 billion Infrastructure and Business Development (IBD) grant.
•	A local content forum to be convened between the developers, Morobe Provincial Government, and landowners, pushing for local content to exceed 80 percent during construction and ongoing operations.
•	An additional profits tax was secured, with a concession on dividend withholding tax.
•	Personal income tax will not be treated as the company’s contributions, unlike in the Lihir project.
•	The SML will be issued for an initial 30-month period, during which investors must complete Front End Engineering Design (FEED) and reach a Final Investment Decision (FID) to qualify for an extension. Upon reaching FID, Kumul Minerals Holdings Ltd (KMHL) will be required to make equity contributions through a cash call.
Prime Minister Marape closed by reaffirming his government’s commitment to fast-tracking the Wafi-Golpu project, urging all stakeholders to move with urgency.
“The time for action is now. We have the framework, we have the opportunity, and now we need to execute,” he said.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Simbu Man’s Fish Farm Empowers Communities,02/10/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1654,"A Senior Chemist from Simbu, Peter Supa has transformed his passion for community development into a thriving fish farming venture giving back to his village in an extraordinary way.
Despite his successful career at Hidden Valley Mine in Morobe Province, Peter felt compelled to support his people back home, leading him to establish the ELIM Fish Farm in 2018.
Starting with just seven ponds, Peter stocked 14,000 tilapia fish, which he sold to local markets for K10-K15 per fish. He initially funded the project from his earnings as a lab technician, hiring local youth and church groups to dig ponds, paying them between K300 and K400.
He aimed to address food security by providing affordable, protein-rich fish to village and town communities.
The success of his initial efforts inspired expansion, and today, Peter has 14 large ponds, each 50 meters by 30 meters, with a production capacity of 300,000 fish. His dedication to growth has been supported by the National Fisheries Authority, which has helped him establish a hatchery.
This hatchery now produces 200,000 to 500,000 fingerlings every two weeks. Using advanced techniques like sex reversal, which ensures faster growth of male fish, Peter is able to meet the high demand for tilapia locally.
Peter’s fish are in such high demand that 14,000 fish can sell out in just two weeks in Chimbu alone. To meet this growing need, Peter is now working with local farmers, supplying them with fingerlings at only twenty toea per fish.
He has already supplied 80,000 fish to farmers in Gembogl, 16,000 to Wabag, and 1 million to Sinesine, with plans to distribute even more in the coming months.
As Peter continues to expand his project, he is focused on one goal: ensuring that every family has access to affordable, nutritious protein, while creating economic opportunities for local farmers.","Community, Joy",Community,Joy

The government is eager to see industry partners collaborate more effectively and help smallholder farmers organize into cooperatives, enabling them to become traders and exporters themselves.""
Regarding the Bougainville Chocolate Festival, Lanbong highlighted its importance as an opportunity to showcase Bougainville’s rich culture, biodiversity, and the hardworking nature of its people. She also acknowledged the global recognition of Bougainville cocoa, particularly through its participation in the annual Cocoa of Excellence show in Europe, which has positioned Bougainville as a quality-producing region.

The last two days of the festival saw many local farmers and entrepreneurs display their cocoa and other commodity by-products, showcasing the potential for developing tangible products from cocoa and other commodities.

She further emphasized the potential of agri-tourism, urging collaboration between the Bougainville Arts, Culture and Tourism Authority and BACRA to develop high-end products that integrate agriculture and tourism.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

ICCC completes draft petroleum pricing review,25/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1584,"The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) has announced the release of the draft report for the 2024 Petroleum Industry Pricing Review.
Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Paulus Ain, stated that the supply of petroleum products (petrol, diesel and kerosene) are essential services that drive an economy in terms of production and transportation of goods and services. Predominantly, fuel is regarded as a major cost factor of doing business in PNG. Given its importance, the ICCC proceeded with a pricing review into the petroleum industry at the beginning of this year, calling for submissions from all stakeholders as part of the consultation process. Based on the submissions that were received together with its own analysis, the ICCC has finalised the Draft Report.
The draft report outlines the ICCC's draft determinations that will apply in the next five-year regulatory period. Among other draft determinations, the ICCC's principle determination is that the prices of refined petroleum products sold at the retail service stations will continue to be regulated.
The ICCC's draft determination for the wholesale margin for 2025 is 30.5 toea per litre with an annual increase of 1.59% productivity factor, in addition to the CPI adjustments. The wholesale margin has been calculated using a building block model similar to the methodology used in the 2019 review.
""This sees an increase of 2.7% above the current margin of 29.7 toea per litre,"" said Ain.
Also, the proposed retail margins have been calculated using the same methodology used in the 2019 review. The retail margin calculation is based on the average site costs and the average monthly sales volumes provided by the wholesalers.
By using the above approach in the retail margin calculation, the ICCC has noted some decreases in the retail prices for most centres.
The ICCC also proposes the drum filling-margin to be 10.2 toea per litre for both new and reused drums. This is an proposed increase of about 2.7% from the existing drum-filling margin.
Ain is again calling on the industry stakeholders, interested persons, and the general public to provide their written comments and submissions on ICCC's draft determinations. The ICCC will be conducting a workshop at Dream Inn, Port Moresby, on 26th September 2024 as part of the consultation process.
All the comments and submissions provided will assist the ICCC to progress the review and complete this process by the end of this year. The ICCC's final determinations will be released in November 2024, however, the prices order will apply in January 2025 for the next five-year regulatory period.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Westpac gets clearance,23/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1555,"The Westpac Banking Corporation ('Westpac') has been given clearance to acquire 8.75 percent of the issued share capital in Westpac PNG Limited (""Westpac PNG"") held by Nambawan Super Limited (""NSL"") (the ""Proposed Acquisition""), according to the Independent Consumer and Competition Commission's ('ICCC') assessment and determination on the Clearance Application on 28th August 2024.
""The ICCC's determination was based on its assessment and considerations that the Proposed Acquisition by Westpac would not have, or would not be likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in any market (s) in PNG,"" ICCC Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Paulus Ain said.
The Proposed Acquisition is not a consolidation of two competing firms in the market for banking and financial services in PNG but between shareholders within Westpac PNG. This is between the controlling shareholder (Westpac) and a minority shareholder (NSL), hence, the current structure of the banking and financial services market and level of competition would remain the same post-acquisition.
The Proposed Acquisition only increases Westpac's controlling interest in Westpac PNG, hence it would not enhance the market position of Westpac PNG, in terms of control, in any relevant market(s) in PNG.
The Proposed Acquisition would increase Westpac's shareholding in Westpac PNG from 89.9 percent of the issued share capital to 98.63 percent.
""Whilst the ICCC appreciates that the parties of the proposed transaction provide banking and financial services, there is no specific market (s) in the Proposed Acquisition where competition is likely to be harmed,"" Mr. Ain said.
Therefore, the ICCC has given Clearance for the Proposed Acquisition to proceed.
Mr. Ain further stated that any interested person/s can access the ICCC's Determination on the ICCC's website at or a hard copy of the determination can be obtained at the ICCC Head office at Level 2, Boroko Post Office Building.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

ANZ alerts businesses to scams,20/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1518,"As scammers using increasingly sophisticated methods to exploit consumers, ANZ is urging Papua New Guineans to be aware of business email compromise and fake invoice scams.
Criminals may pose as a legitimate business and request the urgent transfer of funds to a new account or send false invoices with fraudulent details.
ANZ Papua New Guinea Country Head, Lachlan Halstead, said,
“Scammers can hack into a legitimate business’ email and alter invoice details, so the customer makes a payment into the scammer’s account.
“Businesses of all sizes can be vulnerable to cyberattacks, particularly if their security measures and controls are not robust.
“To protect yourself, always verify invoice details with the person or company you’re paying, especially if the account details have changed or if it’s your first-time making payments to a particular account.
“If you receive an email that pressures you to act quickly or asks you to confirm sensitive information like your Customer Registration Number, password, or PIN, take extra caution and be wary.
“Use a verified phone number and, if possible, speak directly with someone you’ve worked with before from the organisation,” Halstead said.
ANZ has informed on how to spot these scams:
•	Unexpected contact method or requests: Be wary if someone you do not usually have email or social media messaging contact with reaches out with a payment request.
•	Dodgy domains: A cybercriminal will often pick up an email domain that closely resembles the true sender – check the email address carefully to ensure it matches.
•	Modified payment details on an invoice: Check payment details against previous invoices from that business and question any changes to payment details directly with the company or individual you’re paying.
•	Poorly written text or inconsistent message formats: Check for grammatical or spelling errors and look out for anything in a tone that does not match the way the sender usually writes (though a well-written message does not mean it is from the legitimate sender).","Business, Fear",Business,Fear

The YMSC is one of the key ticket items implemented under a MoU signed between CEFI and WNB Provincial Government which is expected to end on 27th July 2026.
The Provincial Administrator for WNB, Leo Mapmani thanked CEFI and BPNG for the initiative and support to run the YMSC in Kimbe.
Mapmani assured CEFI of WNBPG’s support towards the implementation of the CEFI-WNB MoU and to continue the good progress made so far. He pointed out that it was now a challenge for the WNBPG to continue the campaign and reach more schools in the province.
“This is the first of its kind in Kimbe to witness BSP, MiBank, TISA, Nasfund and the Mama Bank mobilize and jointly visit selected schools within the urban settings to promote their products specifically focusing on promoting the savings culture to the children and young people.”

“I believe the impact that (this campaign) will have on the students is that they will learn to save money and also look forward to their future with confidence knowing their savings is available when needed” he added.
Ruango Primary School Head Teacher Nalot thanked CEFI and BPNG for initiating the campaign adding that educating savings to the students at a very young age is important.
“I fully support this campaign because it's targeting school children to teach them about savings which I believe it’s an important part of their learning development.”
“Definitely the campaign will have a big impact on the students because they never had bank accounts, but through the campaign many school children now will be able to have bank accounts, and know  how to save with the help of their parents also,” Nalot concluded.","Community, Joy",Community,Joy

Digicel announces significant mobile network expansion,17/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1474,"Digicel PNG today announced a major milestone in its mission to enhance connectivity across Papua New Guinea.
Since April 2022, Digicel PNG has significantly expanded its network, reaching all 21 provinces and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, enabling more Papua New Guineans to get connected.
Over the past two years, Digicel PNG has built 115 new mobile towers and upgraded 96 mobile towers to 4G LTE, achieving a 20 percent increase in its 4G LTE coverage, thereby solidifying its position as the largest 4G network in the country.
This expansion has resulted in the network covering over 80 percent of the population of Papua New Guinea, including both rural areas and major urban centers such as Port Moresby, Lae, Mt Hagen, Wewak and Kokopo.
""This expansion underscores Digicel PNG’s dedication to bridging the digital divide and fostering economic and social development across Papua New Guinea,"" said Tarik Boudiaf, CEO of Digicel PNG.
""By extending our mobile network to all 21 provinces and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, we are making significant strides towards enabling every Papua New Guinean to get access to reliable and high-speed internet. Digicel has the largest network coverage in the country. ""The deployment of new towers has been strategically balanced across the Highlands region, in Momase, in NGI, and in the Southern region, bringing the new coverage to almost a million people.
""We recognize the critical role that connectivity plays in today’s digital age,"" continued Tarik Boudiaf. ""Our new builds and upgrades, especially targeting rural areas, help to ensure that remote communities are not left behind. In fact, the majority of our mobile network upgrades have been concentrated in the Momase and Southern regions, with the New Guinea Islands and Highlands regions also benefiting significantly.""
""By investing in our network infrastructure, we are not just improving connectivity; we are contributing to the overall development of Papua New Guinea,"" added Boudiaf.
""Whether it’s through facilitating better communication, supporting remote education, or enabling digital commerce, our network plays a vital role in the nation’s progress.""
This expansion is part of Telstra’s commitment to Papua New Guinea, following its acquisition of Digicel Pacific in July 2022. This acquisition reflects Telstra’s dedication to supporting sustainable economic growth in the Pacific region.","Technology, Trust",Technology,Trust

RD Team in Port Moresby for Final Negotiations,11/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1388,"Chairman of RD Group, Roy Rivera and the management team arrived in Port Moresby yesterday from Manila, Philippines, for the final negotiations with the State Negotiating Team to establish a new fishing Joint Venture (JV) between the State and RD.
Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru in his meeting yesterday afternoon with Mr. Rivera and his team made it very clear that he wants the Framework Agreement to be finalized by Friday this week and ready for presentation to NEC next week for consideration and approval.
Minister Maru said:, ""The Phase I of the project will be the establishment of a fishing JV between the State and RD. The Framework Agreement will also include Phase 2 which is the development of a new Madang Integrated Special Economic Zone (SEZ). The integrated SEZ will include an international wharf which will be an alternative to Lae Port to service the Highlands because of the Madang-Baiyer Road, a fuel depot for all the purse-seiners, a slipway and all the associate industries to service the fishing industry like factories for cardboard and canning. It will be a fully integrated SEZ modeled after Java Integrated Industrial Port Estate (JIIPE) in Indonesia. The requirement for capital could be achieved by listing this JV company in the National Stock Exchange so provinces, especially coastal provinces and our own people and institutional investors can invest in this company, so it truly becomes a PNG-owned integrated business.""
Minister Maru also made it very clear that there will be no transfer pricing.
Minister Maru further stated, ""We are very happy that Madang Governor, Hon. Ramsey Parawi, MP, and Member of Rai Coast & Minister for Labor and Employment, Hon.

Agriculture commodity price remain strong,10/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1384,"Global commodity prices for cocoa, coffee, and palm oil continue to remain strong and will do so for the remainder of the year, according to Kina Bank’s August Monthly Economic Report that was released on Friday 6 September 2024.
Kina Bank Managing Director & CEO, Greg Pawson said whilst there are still some uncertainties with the Papua LNG project, the non-resource sector, particularly agriculture has remained strong since earlier this year.
“Cocoa was the standout performer in August, rising by 17.09%. Coffee also ended the month on a strong note, up 9.04%, while Palm Oil saw a modest increase of 0.4%,” Pawson said.
Whilst the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) forecasted a production deficit of 462,000 tonnes for the current cocoa season.
They reported that global supply chains remain constrained due to adverse weather conditions, aging trees, pests, and diseases affecting major cocoa-growing regions.
On another positive note, the gold price increased by 3.467% in August, driven by uncertainty over US inflation figures.
“It is pleasing to note that the Gold price rose by over 60% since the start of 2020. Most of this year’s increase has been driven by the expectation of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve,” Pawson added.
Despite the strong performance in agriculture and precious metals, there is still uncertainty surrounding the Papua LNG project.
“PNG businesses continue to be in a ‘holding pattern’ as the much-anticipated start date for the Total Energies-led Papua LNG project keeps getting delayed. The project is currently in its Front End Engineering Design (FEED) stage. The ongoing delay is expected to strain general economic sentiment, with the projected FX flows for the construction phase needed to stimulate business activity,” he said
“Inspite of the uncertainty and delay in Papua LNG, the increased activity in the agriculture sector is positive for PNG’s long-term growth.”","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Lae mourns loss of prominent figure,09/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1375,"Lae city has, once again, lost a prominent leader with the passing of James Edward Seeto.
The late James first arrived at Salamaua, in Morobe Province, in 1938 with his mother and sister, Joyce, to be with their father.
He took over the business when his father, the late Seeto Kui, passed away on March 18, 1972.
He was the Governing Director of the Seeto Kui Group of Companies when he peacefully passed away on Friday, 6 September.
“The loss of such a remarkable individual is felt deeply, not only by the Seeto family but by the entire community of Lae and Papua New Guinea as a whole,” said Member for Lae and Deputy Prime Minister, John Rosso.
“Late James was more than just a prominent figure; he was a true pillar of our society whose contributions to business, employment and to the development of Papua New Guinea will be remembered for generations to come. His dedication to the growth and progress of Lae, in particular, is a testament to his unwavering commitment to the betterment of our people, our communities and our city of Lae.”
Rosso outlined that the late James played a pivotal role in creating opportunities for countless Papua New Guineans through his leadership, business and service.
He has also been a member of committees and boards in various organisations, including; the Salvation Army, Red Cross Appeal, Heart Foundation, Lae Chamber of Commerce, University of Technology and Disaster Appeals, which are supported by the Seeto Kui Group of Companies.
“In honouring his lifetime of service, we also recognise the personal sacrifices he made and the profound impact he had on those around him,” continued Rosso.
“His legacy of excellence, integrity and dedication will live on through the many lives he touched, and through the lasting contributions he made to our nation.
“To the Seeto family, during this time of sorrow, please know that my thoughts and prayers are with you. May you find comfort in the cherished memories of your father, grandfather and great grandfather and the knowledge that his legacy will continue to guide and inspire us.
“On behalf of the Government and the people of Papua New Guinea, and especially the community of Lae, I offer my deepest sympathies and share in your grief.

Govt delivers Wafi-Golpu position paper,09/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1371,"The PNG Government’s position paper on the Wafi-Golpu Mine in Morobe Province has been delivered to joint venture partners, Newmont and Harmony.
The Government is now awaiting a response from the two companies before moving forward with the issuance of the Mine Development Contract (MDC) and Special Mining Lease (SML).
Prime Minister James Marape made this statement following a meeting held on Friday, September 6, 2024, in Port Moresby, attended by State Negotiating Team (SNT) Chairman, Dairi Vele, Deputy Prime Minister and Lae MP, John Rosso, Morobe Governor, Luther Wenge, and Community Development Minister and Huon Gulf MP, Jason Peter.
“The SNT has been negotiating with the two joint venture partners on what benefits Papua New Guinea gets from the Wafi-Golpu project. That includes our 30 percent equity, financing of that equity, value of the 3 percent royalty, local content, and others,” said Prime Minister Marape.
He emphasised the importance of not delaying the project, stating: “As we prepare to release the SML, work must start immediately, rather than being delayed as we have seen in other projects. The project is now one or two meetings away from the MDC being signed and issuance of SML.
“The joint venture partners have received the SNT’s recommendations on August 8, 2024, and we are waiting for them to respond. I have requested Newmont and Harmony to respond at the earliest so the MDC can be signed and the SML issued.”
Prime Minister Marape noted that the Wafi-Golpu project is expected to operate for over 40 years, and the Government is focused on ensuring all agreements are finalised before the commencement of operations, drawing lessons from the Lihir Mine in New Ireland, which the PM said does not pay corporate tax.
“We want to make sure that we get the total 55 per cent economic benefits we want to get out of the project,” the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister highlighted that the terms for the Wafi-Golpu project were captured in the Framework Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in April 2023 between the State and the joint venture partners. This MoU will serve as the foundation for the MDC and SML.
Key provisions under the Framework MoU include:
•	The State and Papua New Guinea gaining 55 percent of the project economics.
•	State equity at 30 percent, with 10 percent carried, of which Morobe and the landowners will receive the carried equity.
•	A 2 percent tax for fiscal stability, in addition to the full 30 percent tax.
•	Royalty at 3 percent with no deductions.
•	An additional US$394 million committed by Newmont and Harmony for social and community infrastructure, supplementing the Government’s K1.2 billion Infrastructure and Business Development (IBD) grant.
•	A local content forum will be convened with developers, the Morobe Provincial Government, and landowners, where the Government will push for local content to exceed 80 percent during both the construction phase and ongoing operations.
•	An additional profits tax was secured, but a concession was made on dividends withholding tax.
•	Personal income tax was excluded from being treated as the company’s contributions, unlike in the Lihir project.
•	The SML will be initially issued for 30 months, during which the investors must complete Front End Engineering Design (FEED) and reach a Final Investment Decision (FID) to qualify for an extension. Upon reaching FID, Kumul Minerals Holdings Ltd (KMHL) will be required to make equity contributions through a cash call.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Fuel price drop,07/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1348,"The Indicative Retail Prices (IRPs) for petrol, diesel and kerosene will drop on average, throughout Papua New Guinea, effective on Sunday 8th of September.
These retail price decreases were mainly attributed to lower oil demand in China. The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission announced this week the fuel price drop for the month of September.
The IRPs for this month are inclusive of the Import Parity Prices (IPPs) or the imported costs for each petroleum product, domestic sea and road freight rates for the third quarter of 2024, the annual wholesale and retail margins for 2024, and the Goods and Services Tax (GST), including the applicable excise duties, among other parameters.
As a result of adding all the various cost components mentioned above, the maximum retail price movements for petrol, diesel and kerosene in Port Moresby will increase as follows:
The retail prices in all other designated centres will change according to their quarterly approved domestic  freight rates for the third quarter of 2024, and their respective annual retail margins for this year. For all other centres, the maximum retail prices for each regulated petroleum product will all change on average as follows:
Petrol prices will decrease by 23.34 toea per litre;
Diesel prices will decrease by 26.26 toea per litre; and
Kerosene prices will decrease by 22.03 toea per litre.
As part of the ICCC's enforcement and compliance of fuel prices, its Investigation Officers will conduct inspections of all service stations to ensure prices of declared petroleum products comply with the allowable maximum prices.
The prices set by the ICCC are the indicative maximum retail prices, for which retailers may choose to sell below the ICCC-approved maximum price.
ICCC warns that whilst retailers may choose to set fuel prices on their pumps to one decimal place, the ICCC will continue to set the maximum price to 2 decimal places. No fuel pump operator should charge above the Indicative Retail Price for this month's price regardless of the number of decimal places.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy

New bike for rural Pomio officer,05/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1310,"Farmers in Pomio district, East New Britain, will not be working in isolation any longer.
This follows this week’s presentation of a new motorbike to enhance the extension work of the Rural Development Officer (RDO), responsible for several wards along the south coast corridor of Sinivit LLG in Pomio District.
The presentation of the asset, worth almost K10,000, was purchased by the Pomio District Administration, as per a request and because Sinivit LLG has the best performing economic sector in the district.
Acting LLG Manager, Pennie Maroro Junior, said though the motorbike would be under the care of the RDO Elwin Kaival, who is responsible for agriculture and livestock (DAL), it will be used for programs under the economic sector.
Currently there are issues with accommodation at the Mungou station, therefore three officers for the station are still working from Warangoi.
“So, we are renovating a house at the station for the community development officer to move into, and later next year, we will renovate another house for the fisheries officer,” said Maroro Junior.
“We are trying our best to move the officers over because this (Mungou) is where they are supposed to be based.”
He further advised that there will be fermentaries allocated to the station for cocoa farmers accompanied by nurseries, in preparation for the opening of the missing road link, which is currently under construction.
As part of the government’s efforts to create accessibility for villagers along the south coast corridor, materials for the Merai bridge are being transported via the sea while the National Department of Works is responsible for the road and bridges for Marambu and Sikut.
Maroro Junior also announced that they will try their best to get two more motorbikes for the other stations at Sikut and Arabam.
RDO Elwin Kaival said he will manage the bike for his extension work but it can also assist other officers under the economic sector, which is inclusive of Commerce and Fisheries.
Formerly the station manager at Arabam in the inland part of the Bainings, Kaival said he moved over in April this year and so far, has progressed work on farming of rice and cocoa.
“With the rise in the price of cocoa, farmers have shown interest in cocoa and thus we have been setting up fermentaries and hopefully, we should get their licences by this month (September). As for rice, we are milling rice here at the station,” he said.
Given its setting, the south coast area has a lot of economic potential, but there is a need for assistance in terms of training and technical assistance for the farmers and fisherfolks alike.
RDO Officer in Charge in the LLG, based at Warangoi, Lynette Samuel, urged the host wards of Gar and Lat and the others within the south coast corridor to assist Kaival in his extension work with the motorbike and to take ownership in looking after this government asset.
“Although this motorbike may not be a big thing like a car, it is important because the government has spent money on this asset to bring services right to the ward level,” she said.
Sinivit LLG has a total landmass of 2, 117 square kilometres and covers 18 wards scattered between the Inland Baining ranges to the coastline along the south coast.","Agriculture, Trust",Agriculture,Trust
New discovery named after Solwara Warriors,04/09/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1301,"A seabed worm discovered at a depth of 1,500m off the coast of New Ireland Province has been named after an alliance of environmental advocates.
The Alliance of Solwara Warriors have been campaigning against seabed mining in Papua New Guinea since 2009, when Canada-based Nautilus Minerals proposed to mine New Ireland’s seabed.
In acknowledgement of their efforts to safeguard their marine environment, the new species has been given the name “Alaysia solwarawarriors”.
“The name is given in honour of the work ASW has been doing over the years in advocating on the protection of the marine environment and the coastal communities,” said the founder and coordinator of the West Coast Development Foundation, Jonathan Mesulam.
“The new species has also been nominated by WorMS (World Register of Marine Species) as one of the top ten new marine species of 2023,” said Mesulam, who has been taking the lead in the fight against deep-sea mining in his home province for the last decade.
Tubeworms such as the ‘Alaysia solwarawarriors’ are found at deep-sea chemosynthetic environments such as hydrothermal vents, seeps and organic falls.
If the ‘Solwara 1’ project had gotten off the ground, damages to the biodiversity, connectivity and community structure of these areas would have been disastrous. This was outlined in the ScienceDirect journal entitled “Updated phylogeny of Vestimentifera (Siboglinidae, Polychaeta, Annelida) based on mitochondrial genomes, with a new species”.","Environment, Joy",Environment,Joy

TIN deregistration clarified,26/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1200,"The Internal Revenue Commission, or IRC, intends to clean up its taxpayer register.
This is a culmination of over two years of a nationwide taxpayer mapping exercise, where it was deduced that out of more than 220,000 registered Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) holders, only about 16 percent have paid taxes or lodged returns.
IRC Commissioner General, Sam Koim, refuted claims that the TIN deregistration exercise aims to close down SMEs or harm small businesses.
“What has been proposed and intended to be implemented is not designed to harm small businesses, or deregister small businesses or those who are actually in business,” clarified Koim. “Far from that. This is a taxpayer registration cleaning exercise that we are doing.
“Some TINs are as old as 20 or 30 years old and we have no idea whether they are still in business or whether they have done any business.”
Koim said IRC is making an effort to improve the integrity of its tax registration process and the tax register, hence the undertaking of the nationwide taxpayer mapping exercise, which will be followed by TIN deregistration.
“Number 2, we want to allocate resources on a ratio that best fits the taxpaying population. We don’t want to guess and allocate resources because we have very limited resources and we would like to focus on taxpaying population that really requires our attention.
“We have heard a lot of complaints in provinces and in our operational centres; taxpayers and people coming up to us and saying: ‘Our refunds are taking too long’, ‘the processing of returns is taking too long’.
“What we want to do is to now, empower the provinces and empower the operational centres to do more.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
PMIZ project preparations in final stage,24/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1171,"The Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) project in Madang Province is in its final preparation stage before the official commencement of the first phase of the project says Madang Governor Ramsey Pariwa.
Pariwa said this after the National Executive Council approved a joint venture partnership agreement between the state and RD Tuna Canners Limited.
He said the tentative date for the signing of the partnership will be in September. Once the agreement is signed, the first phase of the project will commence.
“PMIZ has been the dream for the people of Madang for the past 20 years since its inception. We are fed up of talking. We have seen and heard about the PMIZ for the last 20 years, but nothing has happened. Our aim now is to see our dream become a reality,” he said.
He said the challenge now is having no or less expertise to run the project, which through the partnership, RD Tuna will take the lead in terms of the know-how to run the fishing project.
Pariwa said the partnership agreement is developed in a way where the people of Madang through the provincial government and district will have fair shares of the equity.
He said the project will pave the way for the PNG government to go into the fisheries industry as a business partner for the first time.
Pariwa added that in the second phase of the project, they will look at developing the enabling infrastructures such as extending the wharf and expanding the electricity.
Meanwhile, Rai Coast MP Kessy Sawang said the PMIZ project will transform the country, create jobs, and change the way of life for not only the people of Madang but the people of Papua New Guinea as a whole.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Access to finance remains an obstacle for MSMEs.,23/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1164,"Small, medium and micro enterprises say that better access to finance will deliver the biggest boost to their business, according to one of the biggest ever studies of the sector in PNG.
The survey was commissioned by Australia to support the Government of Papua New Guinea, with its goal to pursue policies that spur Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector growth.
The ‘MSME and Informal Sector Survey’ findings show that business owners and managers have said easier access to loans, credit and other finance would be the most effective change to improve their business.
The survey of 2,621 enterprises across 21 provinces found that more than half (56 per cent) experienced difficulties getting a loan, including almost a third (31 per cent) who said it was a major obstacle to doing business.
The MSMEs surveyed said more could be done to unlock their growth potential, with 60 per cent of respondents to the survey, stating that having improved access to finance is among the top three of a wish list of ‘most helpful changes’ that could be made.
Almost 40 per cent said that there needed to be better access to management and financial skills training.
Access to finance is not the only challenge MSMEs face. Almost half (48 per cent) also reported that climate change was impacting their business, mainly the effect of increased rainfall in deterring customers, disrupting transport and causing service outages.
At the same time, more than a third said they suffered property damage, temporary business closures, transport disruptions and other costs from the looting, vandalism and security issues associated with the Black Wednesday unrest.
Those who reported to be most heavily affected by the unrest were in the Highlands and Southern regions, while MSMEs in the Islands and Momase regions reported much less impact.
But, despite these and other challenges, MSMEs were overwhelmingly optimistic about their future prospects. Almost 80 per cent expect business and sales to improve over the next 12 months and almost two-thirds (64 per cent) plan to hire more staff.
The survey’s findings will help inform PNG government policies and actions to support the MSME sector and drive employment and economic growth.
Preliminary survey findings were presented at a workshop involving government officials, business leaders, researchers and private sector representatives in Port Moresby on 7 August 2024.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Inspection needed in rural cocoa areas,22/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1150,"A Morobean cocoa fermentary owner is appealing to the Cocoa Board of Papua New Guinea to conduct inspections in rural areas.
Kop Tienare of Gasa Mountain Cocoa, who is from Sibi village, in Nawaeb district, raised concerns on the rise of illegal activities in the remote Wain-Erap LLG.
Tienare said because CBPNG has not been inspecting cocoa operations in remote areas, individuals have taken advantage of their absence and have been buying wet beans without any licence.
“Some are using other fermentary operators’ licences to buy and ferment,” said Tienare.
“If some of us can fully comply with the country’s cocoa laws and regulations, then why is the board not doing its work to ensure everyone follows the rules?”
The fermentary owner called on the Cocoa Board to go into the remote areas and make sure the interests of licenced operators like him are protected.
In response to his call, the Momase regional Cocoa Board manager, Anton Ningi, highlighted that funding constraints hamper the activities of the regulating body.
“Dealing with exporters is a bit easy. However, we find it very challenging to reach out to farmers in each village on process and procedures they should observe while involved in farming, fermentation and trading with exporters,” said Ningi.
“We also find it very challenging to carry out inspections in each village.
“Conducting awareness on our roles and running inspections are expensive exercises. We should be doing these on a monthly basis, but because of lack of funding, we never do these. Our only option is dealing with Local Level Government and district agriculture officers to deal with farmers and fermentary operators.”","Business, Anger",Business,Anger

Maru: Domestication Policy needed,21/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1127,"The fishing industry in the country makes about 20 percent of total catches in Papua New Guinea waters, and 80 percent is taken away by internationally licensed operators to process and sell overseas.
This is according to Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru, who said this is so because, for nearly 50 years, the country does not have a Domestication Policy to prevent international fishing industries from taking away catches in PNG waters.
Minister Maru informed the people of Madang about this serious issue which has been robbing the country of billions of kina and affecting the progress of the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone project.
Minister Maru stated that he has realized that the country has no Domestication Policy and has been trying to ensure the country comes up with one.
He highlighted fishing company Frabelle as an example, a joint venture between Frabelle and Thai Union had to close business because supply was not meeting demand as most of the catches were being flown overseas. This cannery had to close down, laying off more than 3000 employees.
In saying this, Minister Maru added the fact that the PMIZ project does not have the expertise and capacity to get it started. As a countering measure, the government is now working on signing a 50 percent agreement with RD Tuna Canners and piggybacking on their resources and facilities to kick start the PMIZ project.
“Since the Government is not in a position to implement the Domestication Policy sooner, the Joint Venture between RD Tuna Canners will enable locals to participate in learning commercial fishing and compete with other international fishing industries to bring back fish for processing,” Maru said.
He stated it is in the government’s interest to have PMIZ up and running, as it could have a massive impact on the country’s economy.
Maru admitted the fact that the government is responsible for the loss made by not having the Domestication Policy in place and it was about time to have one.","Business, Anger",Business,Anger
Lae considers Black Soldier Fly technology,20/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1122,"The Lae City Authority is considering the benefits of utilising the Black Soldier Fly technology in waste management.
A black soldier fly is sometimes confused with a wasp because of its sleek, black appearance.
It is not a pest. It is a versatile insect that can be found in Papua New Guinea. While adult flies are harmless and do not feed, their larvae, or maggots, feed on a wide range of organic materials without emitting any smell, and can also be used as a protein-rich feed for animals, including fish, chickens and pigs.
Researchers and scientists from Kenya visited Lae in July to propose the concept of black soldier fly farming, which has gained momentum in their country.
Lae City Authority’s chief executive officer, Robin Calistus, said black soldier fly technology could be the way forward for PNG’s industrial hub, considering the main market produces 6,000kg (6 tonnes) of organic waste every day.
“We need to work with these guys, especially the scientists from the National Agriculture Research Institute,” said Calistus. “They have the know-how; it’s a new technology using the black soldier fly. And we have it here.
“With waste management, we are throwing it into the dump. We can utilise that to make money instead of throwing it out. For LCA, we can make revenue out of the waste that we have.
“We are trying to integrate that into the new market. When the new market is built, we will have a facility that will recycle the organic waste to be used as fertiliser.
“With the city wastes from the residents, it will be more than 6 tonnes,” he stated. “It might increase to maybe 20 tonnes a day, if you are collecting organic materials from the city. So, that will be a lot of money if we are to recycle that waste.”
The black soldier fly larvae convert organic waste into two products: A sustainable, nutritious, safe and local source of animal protein, and a highly nutritious and organic Frass fertiliser.
Frass is an all-natural fertiliser made from insect manure.","Environment, Anticipation",Environment,Anticipation

Lessons from Indonesia's SEZs,20/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1117,"Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso led a small Papua New Guinea delegation on Monday, August 19, 2024, to a significant meeting with the management of the Java Integrated Industrial and Ports Estate (JIIPE) Special Economic Zone in Gresik, Surabaya, Indonesia.
This visit is part of a broader series of engagements aimed at attracting trade and investment into Papua New Guinea by Indonesian companies. The initiative follows recent high-level discussions between Indonesian President Joko Widodo and PNG Prime Minister James Marape.
Indonesia, PNG’s closest neighbor, is one of the emerging market economies in the world and the largest in Southeast Asia. As an upper-middle-income country and member of the G20, Indonesia is classified as a newly industrialized country.
Indonesia's nominal GDP reached US$1.371 trillion) in 2023, it is the 16th largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and the 7th largest in terms of GDP (PPP).
The PNG delegation included International Trade and Investment Minister Richard Maru, Labor Minister Kessy Sawang, Madang Governor Ramsey Pariwa, Secretary for International Trade and Investment Jacinta Warakai-Manua, officials from State-Owned Enterprises, PNG Ambassador to Indonesia Simon Namis, and embassy staff.
During the visit, the delegation received an in-depth briefing from JIIPE management, along with representatives from the mining company PT Freeport Indonesia. The briefing provided insights into the operations of this flagship Indonesian project, followed by a tour of the SEZ.
JIIPE was designated as an SEZ by President Joko Widodo in 2021, marking it as a national strategic project designed to meet industrial needs. The SEZ boasts superior connectivity through multimodal transportation, a connected deep seaport, a one-stop complete utility service, environmental permits, and expedited construction permits.
These attributes, along with the availability of essential utilities like power plants, industrial freshwater, waste management, gas supply, and telecommunication networks, have made JIIPE a major investment destination in Indonesia. The SEZ currently hosts over 17 tenants, including Bank of Indonesia and PT Freeport Indonesia.
Deputy Prime Minister Rosso emphasized the significance of the meeting, particularly in the context of PNG's own SEZ development efforts all over the country, including in Madang for fisheries and nickel, and in Lae for the Wafi-Golpu Mine. He remarked on the relevance of Indonesia's experience to PNG's ambitions.
“Indonesia has already gone down that path (SEZ development), learned from your mistakes, and you will be able to teach us. The SEZ here replicates what we are trying to understand and achieve at two of our ports (Madang and Lae),” Deputy Prime Minister Rosso said.
“It has a lot of similarities to two of the SEZs we are trying to build in PNG: One in Madang where we have a nickel mine, and my home city of Lae, which, like Surabaya, is the second-largest city and industrial hub of PNG.”
Minister Maru, who oversees SEZ development in PNG, highlighted the alignment between Indonesia's SEZ experience and PNG's goals for SEZ development.
“In Madang, there is already land and a deep-water port available, which makes it the ideal location for development of a special economic zone for fisheries and other industries,” Minister Maru said.
“We also want to develop a smelter in Lae so that gold and other minerals from Wafi-Golpu, and other mines throughout the country, can be processed at this SEZ. It can also create thousands of new jobs,” Minister Maru added.
“The Indonesia experience is an eye-opener for PNG on what can be achieved and best of all, they are willing to help us.” Minister Maru concluded.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

"75,000 SMEs needed annually to meet govt target",18/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1082,"PNG should consider investing more in creating and supporting Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) because the country has a lot to benefit from it, especially in terms of creating employment for the teeming youth population and to boost the economy.
Deputy Director of the National Research Institute, Professor Eugene Ezebilo says according to the World Bank, SMEs account for 90 percent of businesses in the world and more than 50 percent of employment in the world, and contributes up to 40 percent to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
He said according to the PNG SME Policy, the target is to have 500,000 SMEs by 2030 in the country.
“However, currently, there is about 50,000 SMEs in the country, meaning that we still need to create 450,000 SMEs to meet the target.”
For PNG to meet this target, there is a need to create at least 75,000 SMEs each year from 2024. However, the question is, what strategy should be used to create the additional SMEs to meet the target of 500,000 SMEs by 2030?
A seminar on the government’s MSME credit scheme held on Wednesday, 14 August 2024 was timely and Prof. Ezebilo acknowledged the presenters including Dr Francis Odhuno from PNG NRI, Mr Charles Wapinien from PNG University of Technology and Dr Kepha Pondi from Pacific Adventist University.
The study requested government-financed MSME loan data but both the National Development Bank (NDB) and BSP Financial Group Limited (BSP) were unable to share this vital information. As an alternative, a sample frame was determined in consultation with the Small and Medium Enterprises Corporation (SMEC).
The study interviewed over 500 people - some potential business entrepreneurs while others already established small business entrepreneurs. These are entrepreneurs who had participated in the SMEC’s ‘Start and Improve Your Business’ capacity building and training program from 2021, 2022 and 2023, to understand the impact of the govt-backed loan from their perspective.
It was found that MSMEs finance their business activities through:
•	Personal finance – 46%
•	Retained Earnings – 13%
•	Credit or Loan – 4%
•	Govt. Loan/Grants/Subsidies – 0%
•	Finance from friends/relatives – 6%
The seminar highlighted that access to financing is key to growth and development of MSMEs; however, one of the major constraints of local MSMEs is inadequate credit or difficulty in getting the available commercial bank loans.
The presentations discussed how MSMEs finance their business activities, how MSMEs perform with and/ or without government support, and the experiences of MSME’s seeking government support loans.
The seminar highlighted main issues that act as constraints to accessing credit and includes:
•	Businesses not registered with Investment Promotion Authority or Internal Revenue Commission;
•	Insufficient (own) funds for equity;
•	Not having a collateral;
•	Too many additional fees;
•	High interest rates;
•	Long loan application process; lack of relevant information and guidance;
•	Limited awareness;
•	Not having a bank account; and
•	Certificates (Example, financial literacy certificates).
It also concluded that challenges that MSME operators often face include the following:
•	Inadequate experience in managing their businesses and inadequate business support;
•	Location of their businesses,
•	High transport cost;
•	High prices, shrinking sales, inadequate demand; and

Minister Maru meets PMIZ landowners,17/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1075,"Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru, has challenged the landowners and the Governor of Madang Province, Ramsey Pariwa to fix their in-house issues in order to realize the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone Project in Madang Province.
The Minister addressed landowners, impacted communities and the provincial government at the St. Benedicts Agricultural Technical School in Danip along the North Coast Road yesterday, clearing any misconceptions surrounding the PMIZ project.
Landowners were vocal about the ongoing discussions relating to the implementation of the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone Project. Much of their concerns were about the involvement of landowner businesses and registered groups to participate in the discussions and of how soon this entity will begin its operations.
Representative of Ariroinab Cooperative Society, Anna Dirau, wanted to see more landowner groups engaged with the government and external stakeholders on talks regarding PMIZ.
Former Governor, James Yali, also addressed the meeting, stating that PMIZ must be realized and that Madang needs this development to boost its economy. He also brought to their attention that the PMIZ project has become a milking cow for many high profiled and corrupt elites, resulting in minimal to no development as yet.
With the high unemployment rate of the province, Mr. Yali stressed that he would like to see many of the youths participate and work when the PMIZ starts operations.
In terms of equity, Mr. Yali states that they should not be spectators in their own land but to be part and parcel of the returns made on their land.
Governor Ramsey Pariwa made it clear to the people that the PMIZ project is not under the Provincial Government, nor under National Fisheries but under the National Government and falls under Minister Maru’s International Trade and Investment department. He emphasized the need tp get this project off the ground and urged the minister to enlighten the people of the next steps in order for work to begin.
Minister Maru made it clear to the people that the government is now the third landowner of the 225 hectares of land purchased from RD Tuna after landowners had sold it. RD Tuna, the longest serving fishing company in the country still has 645 hectares and told the people that the project needs basic infrastructures in order for initial ground work to commence.
“The truth is government em i nogat expertise long painim pis na ronim pis industry insait long kantri. It’s the fact that the government needs to acknowledge,"" stated Minister Maru.
Another challenge to the Governor was to sort out power and water issues within the province before any infrastructure can operate for the project. The province continues to experience power and water outages lasting for days.
Minister Maru highlighted that with no background in commercial fishing it would be hard to start up the project. As a result, an MOU is being drafted for a partnership with RD Tuna Canners to commence this process so that identified locals can participate in trainings.
Minister Maru states that as soon as the MOU is signed, he expects all other aspects of development to start commencing with the National Fisheries Authority to be on site at the project location and locals to start work RD Tuna as part of training.
Landowners and the impacted communities along the PMIZ project area were thankful the insight and being made aware of the challenges that lay ahead in order for the project to run.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
American Companies Frustrated,16/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1069,"It is difficult to attract American companies to invest in Papua New Guinea (PNG) if they continue to go through the frustrations of establishing themselves in the country, says the United States (US) Ambassador to PNG, Ann Marie Yastishock.
Ambassador Yastishock made this statement recently in her meeting with the Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru.
Ambassador Yastishock said, “A classic example is StarLink. StarLink was promised a license in January this year. We are now in August and they still have not had their approval. One of the big sticking points for US and the US companies is ease of doing business and it is not always easy to do business here in PNG.
So, the questions are: What do we do to attract those American businesses to come to PNG? How do we get NICTA to approve StarLink License that would reduce the cost of internet access which will be helpful to communities who do not have access to the internet? It is difficult to understand why it is very difficult to get approval in PNG when Pacific Island countries like Tonga and Fiji have approved StarLink which has brought down the cost of internet access big time.”
Ambassador Yastishock further stated, “There is a lot PNG can offer including the population and the landmass, and it sits in a place between ASEAN, South East Asia and the Pacific, and it is a member of the APEC. We have American businesses already operating in the country including Exxon Mobil, Hilton, Marriot, and Newmont that has now started up.
We are also talking to some other American companies about coming to PNG but it is these little stumbling blocks that frustrates American companies. Without dealing with issues like this and the Government not being able to help us we cannot attract American businesses to come and operate in PNG to help drive the cost of doing business down, create employment, and help drive economic growth.”
Minister Maru in response said, “American companies have a good reason to be frustrated. This is unacceptable. We need competition and we need to drive the cost of doing business down in the country, including internet cost. Our consumers should be the most important factor. We need to drive the cost of doing business down in this country and make it affordable. PNG has one of the highest costs of doing business and when American companies are willing to help us to offer critical services, we are just frustrating them.”
It is understood that the Ombudsman Commission has stopped NICTA from issuing the license because of some investigations which has taken over eight months while the country and the consumers have been held at ransom.","Business, Frustration",Business,Frustration

Mt Wilhelm welcomes new Betty’s Lodge,15/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1051,"Residents around the Mt. Wilhelm Trout Farm, in Simbu Province, were treated to colourful cultural performances on the beautiful sunny morning of Tuesday, August 13th.
Twenty diverse and vibrant singsing groups, from Bundi and Gembogl, drew over a thousand people to witness and celebrate the grand opening of the new ‘Betty's Lodge’, owned by prominent businesswoman, Betty Higgins.
The new Betty's Lodge offers 12 spacious rooms, each with a toilet and bathroom. Of these, some are family rooms that could lodge a family of up to 6 or adventurers travelling in groups.
The wooden lodge, surrounded by a dense forest, offers a rustic feeling for adventure seekers without compromising quality and comfort.
The guest of honour at the event, Pam Christie, a very close and dear friend of Betty's, challenged those who participated at the event to protect their culture and mountain.
She said: “For over 20 years now, Betty has been lobbying the government to fix the road to Mt. Wilhelm, the top adventure and tourism destination of PNG, in vain. But we are surviviors.
“As a team, together we survived over the years and will continue to promote Mt. Wilhelm tourism.”
She further callenged the local communities of Kundiawa-Gembogl and Bundi to respect Betty and the work of tourism in this beautiful part of PNG.
Pam Christie, a New Zealander, is the founder of PNG Trekking Adventures; a tour company that markets Mt. Wilhelm globally for adventure seekers.
She attended the grand opening of Betty’s new lodge at Mt. Wilhelm with her husband Mark and niece Clara, travelling all the way from New Zealand.
Also in attendance were a couple of young Russian tourists, Betty’s husband Peter Presland, and Betty’s children and grandchildren from Wewak, Lae and Brisbane, Australia.
Higgins, a pioneer in agri-tourism in PNG, is also the first woman to build the biggest most successful inland commercial trout farming in the country. She champions the 'farm to table' concept where visitors get to gather their own veggies and rainbow trouts from the farms for their meals.
She built the lodge because she wanted something that will enhance the face of tourism at Mt. Wilhelm and in PNG.
“If we had a good road, I would have built a 5-star resort here to get bus loads of tourists so a lot of locals would have money in their pockets to sustain their livelihoods,” she stated.","Tourism, Joy",Tourism,Joy
NFA Revises Beche-de-mer Plan,15/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/1050,"The National Fisheries Authority (NFA) is currently finalizing a new revised National Beche-de-mer Fishery Management Plan. The plan aims to effectively manage and support beche-de-mer fishery farmers and investors across all maritime provinces in Papua New Guinea.
The decision to close the beche-de-mer fishery is intended to allow stocks to recover fully and to provide sufficient time to review and update the management plan to reflect the evolving dynamics of the fishery and the ecosystems that support its viability.
The revised management plan will continue to promote sustainable harvests of the stocks and ensure long-term benefits for the livelihoods of coastal and island communities. The closure is essential for the finalization and ratification of the new revised management plan by the NFA Board.
The plan aims to incorporate a holistic approach to the beche-de-mer fishery, safeguarding the interests of both present and future stakeholders while promoting economic prosperity for local communities without compromising the biological sustainability of the beche-de-mer stocks.
The revisions will support the implementation of initiatives such as community-based sandfish farming, commercial hatchery development, enhanced monitoring and reporting, and improved harvest strategies to enable longer open seasons for the fishery.
The NFA is conducting a nationwide biological assessment to update the status of the beche-de-mer stocks and expects to complete these efforts by the end of the year. The NFA seeks the support of island and coastal communities to help expedite the review of the management plan and ensure that a management decision is made promptly.
The NFA also warned coastal and island communities to be cautious of companies or individuals claiming to have valid licenses or permits, as this could lead to illegal beche-de-mer harvesting. Engaging in illegal activities could lead to severe penalties.
The public will be informed of any reopening of the beche-de-mer fishery through mainstream media by the NFA, once all requirements are met.","Fisheries, Anticipation",Fisheries,Anticipation

However, Thompson said the challenge is still in growing more bulb onions as we have more than half of the bulb onions imported as we cannot supply our own domestic needs.
“Whilst the Government has created four additional economic  Ministries out of the former Commerce and Industry and Agriculture and Livestock, we need to pick up production from the six combined Ministries,” he said.
“The government can address the Youth bulge by supporting  FPDA with funding to create 6600 Ward Agriculture Extension Workers that can absorb those with training in Agriculture. “Everyone in PNG grows or eats traditional or introduced or imported vegetables and fruits and that can be sure investment in increasing food security and self-reliance in food production.”

According to the Governor, a recent meeting with the President of the prospect company for the establishment of PMIZ, Thai Union, the largest fish-producing establishment in the world, was disappointing as he said that Madang could not supply fish if they established the project, as they lacked the capacity.
According to Thai Union, RD Tuna Canneries only produces up to 60 percent to 70 percent capacity of fish and if they were to establish 10 canneries, there were doubts of supply meeting the demand.
The community was told that the challenge now is to prove critics wrong, as he has come back determined to empower locals to build up supply demand.
Pariwa is also disappointed that this crucial piece of information has not been discussed by the government and its agents for the last 20 years.
Governor Pariwa said for the strategy plan for PMIZ to be realized, he has initiated two phases which will prepare the province for the project. For phase one, he is working towards the Provincial Government and National Government signing a Memorandum of Understanding with RD Tuna Canners in a joint venture agreement.
For phase two, the Governor states that facilities and infrastructures need to be built within the project site, such as roads, power stations and water supply.

Lae LOs venture into catering,05/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/922,"Landowners of Lae city, in Morobe Province, have ventured into the catering industry through their company, Butibam Progress Ltd.
In spite of the usual heavy downpour in Lae, residents of Butibam village, including the chiefs of their six clans, gathered at the Mobil Service Station, along Milfordhaven Road, to celebrate the opening of their new café.
Under the leadership of chairman Paul Gware, the landowner company, called Butibam Progress Ltd, is trying out a new business venture with the opening of the Aklim-lum Café.
In the local dialect, “aklim” is the tree called Erima, with the scientific name ‘Octomeles sumatrana’. Before development took place, that particular area had a grove of erima, or aklim. ‘Lum’ means place.
“The elders have recognised it; this is the area that it grows in so that’s why we’ve decided to use the name ‘aklim-lum’. That’s reflective of our traditional names and we’d like to see a few more of those being used around Lae rather than using foreign names,” said Gware.
“With the café itself, initially, when the service station was opened, RH Trading was operating the café. However, they decided to get out of the café business and we’ve come on board and taken it as a subsidiary of Butibam Progress Ltd.
“To run the café and possibly look at other options of catering for other companies as well.”
Gware said the café is located in an ideal location as it is right along the Highlands Highway and near the service station, where vehicles stop to refuel before heading out of the city.
“We’ve got other ventures but going into catering or the food business, this is the first one,” said the chairman. “We’ve got our security company, which is already up and running, and we’ve got our properties; the backbone of our company are the properties.”
Butibam Progress has its own building at Top Town – between Papindo and Big V – a property at 5th Street, and a number of rental units opposite the National Polytechnic Institute of PNG and along Buimo Road.
Butibam Progress was one of the first associations registered in the country in 1974. A group of likeminded individuals within Butibam formed the association with a common interest in sports. From there, it expanded through a business venture where gravel along the Bumbu River was sold. The gravel quarry operation boosted the company, making it possible to acquire properties.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy
FPDA calls for partnership with provinces,05/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/917,"The agricultural sector can make a real impact on community transformation if district and provincial authorities align their development priorities with state agencies.
Fresh Produce Development Agency (FPDA) chief executive officer, Mark Worinu emphasized these remarks recently.
He said forging partnerships will help achieve key development agendas in the agriculture sector.
Mr Worinu pointed out that one of the main setbacks in advancing the government agenda in getting people to meaningfully participate in national development through agriculture has been the lack of collaboration between government authorities and agriculture agencies.
Worinu emphasised that FPDA's mandate is to facilitate the development of the country's horticulture industry from production to marketing through its primary function as an information source relating to horticultural activities throughout the country.
Therefore, working in partnership with districts and provinces will bring tangible services to the people.
Mr Worinu highlighted that FPDA works with farmers daily to build their capacity to shift from subsistence farming into commercial fruit and vegetable cultivation that is consistent with modern market demands.
He said PNG is a growing economy where the demand for high-quality and nutritious food is increasing due to an increase in food security and nutrition awareness, proportionately with an increase in population.
""Commodity boards like FPDA and Coffee Industry Corporation, among others, try to deliver their programs in the districts as best as they can, but our budgets are limited.
""When we go into the districts to implement donor-funded projects, we find out that the priorities of the districts are different to that of government agencies and agriculture commodity boards. That's why we cannot achieve targets.
""We need commitment from the districts and provinces to provide support to the commodity boards to help our farmers.
""We need people on the ground to show commitment. Provinces and districts must align their programs with the state agencies.
He further explained that farmers need to understand the market requirements and the supply chain; hence, FPDA needs partnerships to help our people.
Mr Worinu reiterated that FPDA wants to partner with the districts and provinces by combining their resources and sharing responsibilities to help farmers be competitive and achieve self-sufficiency and efficiency in production.
""State agencies in the agriculture sector have deliberate intervention programs that run parallel and can transform the lives of people in the rural communities if they are given the boost by our local government authorities.”","Agriculture, Trust",Agriculture,Trust
Cooperative societies launched in Kairuku,05/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/914,"Over the weekend 32 cooperative societies were launched at Abeda Camp, Kuni village in Kairuku district, Central Province.
The cooperatives are designed to offer sustainable economic opportunities and improve living standards for local communities. With effective management, these initiatives are poised to reshape the financial landscape of Kairuku and foster self-reliance among the people.
Member for Kairuku, Peter Isoaimo informed the people that the provincial government had allocated seed money from the district’s K1 million economic sector fund. He announced that his office would be processing seed capital of K5,000 for each of the 32 cooperative societies, totalling approximately K160,000.
Isoaimo said that the K1 million allocated to the economic sector would support various small and medium enterprises (SMEs), not just the cooperatives. He emphasised that the funding is aimed at broader economic development, including aid for local trade store owners.
Isoaimo explained that while more funds could be provided, due diligence and requirements must be met, and certificates and bank accounts must be reviewed first. He advised the cooperatives to open bank accounts to ensure smooth transactions, as his officers would deliver the cheques directly for clearance and business use.
Joseph Fanau, director of Abeda Agro Forest Ltd and local Ward 1 representative, spoke about the significance of cooperatives and Incorporation Land Groups in tackling financial and resource challenges. Although initially aiming to establish 37 cooperatives, 33 have been successfully launched.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

New Coffee Export Complex,04/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/905,"The new Lae Coffee Export Building opened last Thursday, August 1, 2024, is designed to serve multiple critical functions that will enhance operational efficiency and export capabilities.
The office is designed to meet the specification that facilitates international best practice and reputable processes at the export end of the coffee market chain.
It comprises several levels, designed to serve specific functions.
The ground level includes the reception area, a tasting laboratory, and a chemical laboratory.
This level is dedicated to the initial handling and assessment of coffee beans, ensuring they meet the required standards before processing for export while the upper level is designated for administrative functions and meeting rooms, video conference, and others.
The office spaces will facilitate the smooth coordination of export documentation and other administrative tasks.
By integrating all these aspects into one facility, the Coffee Industry Corporation can better support our exporters and maintain the high standards for which PNG coffee is known globally.
The facility is equipped with advanced lab equipment to carry out comprehensive quality assessments and grading of coffee.
The Quality Control Officers will now be able to conduct more detailed quality tests, ensuring that PNG coffee meets the highest international standards demanded by our customers.
Issuance of quality assessment certificates and collecting feedback, etc.
Chief Executive Officer for Coffee Industry Corporation, Charles Dambuni when speaking at the opening clarified that the building will also serve as a central point for the collection of levies.
“This streamlined process will facilitate better financial management and support the continued development of the coffee industry.”
He further pointed out that the new facility will also play a crucial role in facilitating the export of green bean coffee.
It will ensure that all necessary documentation and processes are handled efficiently, reducing turnaround times and enhancing the overall export experience for our partners and clients.
Meantime, Prime Minister James Marape acknowledges the Coffee Industry Corporation for its commitment to establishing the magnificent office complex.
“I’m happy to witness an occasion that comes about as a result of the hard work of CICL CEO Mr. Dambui and his staff,” Prime Minister Marape stated.
“Such a building could have cost K100 million, yet this demonstrates the wise use of the limited funds provided by the Government to CICL.
“I thank Mr Dambui and the CICL team for their strategic leadership in wisely using limited funds to achieve such a major project.
“CICL shows us all that we can build major projects if we wisely use limited funds as they have done. This is a challenge to districts, provinces government departments, and agencies that have been given hundreds of millions of government funding over many years, but have achieved little.
“One of the reasons why Papua New Guinea has not progressed over the last 49 years is that we have been using funds without achieving anything. This is something that we should all be ashamed of.”
The construction of the Lae Coffee Export Building was initiated in February 2021, following the ground-breaking ceremony on January 26, 2021.
The project, valued at K10,661,008.43 was awarded to Haom Builders under CSTB Contract Number 3766 and NEC Decision No.86/2020.
Despite facing drawbacks, particularly due to the post-COVID-19 pandemic, the project is now complete and ready for operation.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

PM condemns killing of Chinese national,02/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/890,"Prime Minister James Marape has expressed his deep condolences while condemning the killing of a Chinese national engaged in alluvial mining activities in the Wau Waria District of Morobe Province.
It was alleged that a group of descendants of Tribute Block Holders, who claimed to have mining rights over a site at Kilolo Bridge, outside of Wau town, attacked the operation there.
The act has also resulted in several injuries and significant damages.
“It is with profound sadness and outrage that I address the recent violent attack that has led to the tragic death of a Chinese national and injuries to others in the Wau-Waria District,” said the PM.
“Such senseless acts of violence are completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated in our country.”
The Prime Minister has issued a stern warning to those responsible for such criminal activities, saying: “Those who perpetrate these violent acts will face the full force of the law. The Government of PNG is firm in its commitment to ensuring the safety and security of all individuals residing in our country, including our international partners and workers.
“We are taking immediate steps to resource our police force adequately, extending our law enforcement capabilities to the ward level to prevent such incidents and bring perpetrators to justice swiftly.
“We will also investigate how the Chinese man got engaged in the alluvial mining business,” said the PM, as alluvial mining is an activity reserved for Papua New Guineans.
In a message to the Chinese Government, the Prime Minister conveyed his condolences and reassurances.
“We assure you that every effort is being made to apprehend and prosecute those responsible for this crime. Our police forces are fully mobilised and are working tirelessly to ensure that justice is being served.”","Politics, Anger",Politics,Anger
New era for PNG coffee,02/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/887,"The quality of PNG coffee is set to increase with the opening of the new Lae Coffee Export Complex on Thursday, August 01st.
Prime Minister James Marape officially unveiled the new building.
Valued at K10.6 million, construction started in February 2021 and despite post-COVID drawbacks, including delays in the delivery of supplies, the state-of-the-art facility was finally commissioned on August 1st by PM Marape.
Speaking at Kisere St, near the main market, CIC’s Chief Executive Officer, Charles Dambui, said the new office will serve their 32 registered coffee exporters.
“They are located in various provinces of our country,” said Dambui. “Eighteen of them are already exporting to China, as per the protocols that our minister has signed. These exporters represent the rich diversity of PNG’s coffee-growing regions and contribute significantly to our overall export volume and value.”
Dambui said from 2018 to 2020, PNG faced a cumulative decrease in coffee exports by approximately 22.79 percent due to the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“However, from 2021 to 2023, the industry demonstrated a strong recovery with exports increasing by 10.48 percent, 13.29 percent, and 13.51 percent respectively. This recovery phase was driven by the easing of pandemic restrictions, government support, price and freight subsidies, and an increase in world market prices.
“In terms of export value, earnings surged by 42.95 percent in 2021 and 43.55 percent in
2022, even surpassing pre-pandemic figures.
“Despite a slight drop in 2023 by 6.02 percent, the overall export earnings for the past five years reached K3.085 billion; a 27.12 percent increase compared to the previous five-year period.
“Our coffee currently is exported to 34 countries, reflecting the global recognition and demand for PNG coffee,” said Dambui. “Notable destinations include China, United States, Germany, Japan and of course, Australia. Those are our major markets.”
The new Lae Coffee Export Building has a tasting laboratory and a chemical lab on the ground floor while the upper level is designed for administrative functions.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
NEC approves two-phase development for PMIZ,01/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/880,"The National Executive Council (NEC) in its recent Meeting No: 13/2024 approved, in principle, that the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) in Madang Province will be developed in two phases. Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru announced this on Thursday August 1st, 2024 in Port Moresby.
""The Phase I of the project will be the establishment of a fishing Joint Venture (JV) between the State and RD. The Marape-Rosso Government first want to start up a PNG fishing company so we can have our own local master fishermen, our own fishing boats, and have the fish security before we can go into processing and canning,” said Minister Maru.
Maru updated that the Government has decided to enter a strategic JV fisheries business with RD which is a current established fishing company with established business, facilities, management and industry knowledge, skills and expertise, years of experience, and networking both in the region and globally and understands the global market.
“It makes good commercial sense for the State to approach RD with all its facilities to enter into a JV. The State for its part would inject equity to get into the fishing business and have its nationals employed and immersed into the business to learn the trade and acquire the expertise so eventually we can have our own people set up and own the fisheries industry in the country. Countries like Australia do not issue licenses to foreign fishing vessels. One day we can reach that point so we can and own our fisheries industry. For now we are only rent collectors,” Minister Maru explained.
For the State to directly establish itself in the fisheries sector, it would be faced with huge costs of initial capital investment. The financial costs to set up directly to enter the business would be excessive and untenable for the Government.
“We do not have the management experience nor the technology and skills of commercial fishing enterprise as a country. We need to partner and learn the trade of the commercial fishing business first over a period of time until we are confident to venture on our own. We have to learn to crawl before we can walk,"" said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru further stated, ""Currently, we do not have our own fishing boats, our own master fishermen, we have no expertise in fishing, and in the last 50 years we have never domesticated our fisheries industry and as a result we have missed out in building another ten canneries because 80% of our catch is taken overseas, we have lost 50,000 jobs, we are earning a net revenue of only K300 million a year (after discounts and rebates from our license fish) when we could be earning K5 billion in revenue, and we also lose out on many revenue streams ranging from landing fees, shipping licenses, loss of jobs, wages, income taxes, corporate taxes, GST, fuel, water, electricity, and opportunities for other local commercial businesses revolving around the commercial fishing enterprise. We have our people graduating National Fisheries College in Kavieng but where are they? They are not in the industry- we are all spectators. We have lost all these opportunities because we have never domesticated the industry.""
""We are still as Coastal State since both before and after Independence. We are yet to change our status to be recognized as a Fishing State.
“Fishing states often have a large fishing fleet, extensive coastal waters, and a strong presence in international fisheries management organizations. PNG has missed out big time by being a rent collector and the Marape-Rosso Government has made a very bold decision to shift us from being a rent collector to a Fishing State.
Minister Maru added, ""Whilst RD has established fishing business in Madang and has all the facilities and infrastructure that the State needs to get into the fishing business, it does not have enough vessels and volume of fish caught per day to process at its processing plant which needs 200 metric tons of fish each day to make it viable for it to operate profitably. Fish security is very critical.”
If Phase 1 is successful only then can the  government move onto Phase 2 which is to build the country’s own cannery and other associated businesses in the 250 hectares of State Land at the PMIZ to take advantage of the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) benefits and incentives that PMIZ can offer before the state can invite other investors to come and invest in the PMIZ.
""PNG has a rich and large EZZ of 2.4 million square kilometers in extent, making it one of the most productive in the region. PNG accounts for approximately 18% of the world's tuna catch and controls around 15% of the global tuna trade with an estimate value between USD$4 billion-USD$5 billion (K 13.3 billion — K 16.9 billion) (NFA 2022). However, the majority of this catch is re-routed at high seas to other countries, and is processed overseas, depriving PNG of significant benefits.
Currently, the revenue from the fisheries sector to the Government has mainly been resources rents all these years. The overall production output of fisheries exports for PNG has remained steady above Kl billion mark since 2016. PNG needs to break this cycle and get into the fishing business and benefit from the K 12 billion K 15 billion revenue that is generated from the fish harvested from its EEZ by others.""
Minister Maru commended the National Government for the decision to develop the PMIZ in two phases and described this decision as an important policy shift by the Government.
""This the biggest game changer in our fishing industry since independence,"" said Minister Maru.
Meanwhile, the NEC also approved the State Negotiating Team led by Chairman, Dairi Vele to negotiate and finalize the JV company agreement with RD for a 50:50 shareholding in the next four weeks so it can go back to the Cabinet for consideration and approval.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
NFA clarifies PMIZ and ENBi,01/08/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/879,"The Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) project and the East New Britain initiative (ENBi) concept are two distinct initiatives of the PNG government.
The National Fisheries Authority (NFA) of Papua New Guinea in a statement clarified that the PMIZ project remains in Madang Province and has not been relocated to East New Britain Province, contrary to recent speculation.
The Ministry of International Trade and Investment (MITI) provides policy oversight over the PMIZ as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), whilst the operationalization of the project lies with the National Fisheries Authority (NFA). The PMIZ project is a flagship project of government that focuses on the industrial development of the offshore fishery overseen by a whole-of-government approach through a project steering committee (PSC).
Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru also emphasized that PMIZ will not leave Madang Province.
“I want to say to the people of Madang, PMIZ is not going to ever leave Madang. PMIZ will be delivered in Madang but in two phases. Phase 1, we own the fishing company. When we have the catch, we create our canary. It makes commercial sense, there is wisdom in what we are trying to do. We will employ the people of Madang and they will work in their own province in the canary.
“Rabaul is a different proposal. PMIZ will remain in Madang and it will be progressed in these two phases as decided by Cabinet.”
In contrast, the ENBi is a regional concept endorsed by the Pacific Island Forum (PIF) leaders that calls for regional collaboration in various development opportunities, that is aimed at developing and establishing innovative and inclusive investment pathways. This will be achieved with all the seventeen (17) FFA member countries working together in an effort towards supporting a sustainable future for our people in the Pacific as envisioned in the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.
This initiative will also involve the broader PIF member countries when everything proceeds as planned.  The ENBi concept was established during the Special Forum Fisheries Ministers’ meeting held in Kokopo in September 2023, hence the name East New Britain.
The NFA envisages that once fully implemented, the PMIZ will be one of the projects to be considered as an investment development opportunity under the ENBi for other FFA member countries to consider investing in.
The National Fisheries Authority states that it remains committed to sustainably managing and protecting Papua New Guinea’s fisheries and marine resources. They are dedicated to ensuring that these resources provide equitable benefits to the people while supporting sustainable development for future generations.","Government, Trust",Government,Trust

Porgera focused despite Mulitaka disaster,25/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/764,"Despite the operational challenges presented by the recent Mulitaka landslide, Porgera Gold Mine has met or exceeded its targets since resuming mining in December last year.
This has resulted in gold production for the first half of the year above guidance and all-in-sustaining costs trending lower.
Barrick president and chief executive Officer Mark Bristow, who was in the country to review New Porgera Limited’s (NPL) second-quarter results, said keeping Porgera open in the wake of the landslide allowed for a swift response by the mine to the collective recovery effort while sustaining the mine’s contribution to the provincial and national economies.
“Reacting rapidly to the disaster, our teams put into operation an air bridge and a temporary pipe across the slip to be able to supply fuel and essential goods not only to the mine but to local businesses serving the tens of thousands of residents of the Porgera valley.
“The cooperation of the Mulitaka community is essential to keeping these lifelines open until the permanent bypass road can be completed,” Bristow said, expressing his deepest sympathies to the families and friends of victims of the landslide and reaffirming NPL’s commitment to impacted communities.
“Porgera employees have been on the ground in Mulitaka daily and are embedded at the Enga Provincial Government’s disaster relief center in Wabag to assist with all aspects of the rehabilitation effort. These include the delivery of essential goods and fuel while contributing geotechnical expertise to assist with ground stabilization and the design of the new bypass road.
“Barrick and JV-partner Zijin also jointly contributed US$1 million towards relief efforts, approximately half of which has already been deployed.”
During his visit, Bristow met with Prime Minister James Marape, Enga Governor Sir Peter Ipatas and Provincial Administrator Sandis Tsaka to exchange views on the Mulitaka recovery, the New Porgera Community Development Agreement (CDA) negotiations, and other issues of common interest.
It was agreed that the CDA must be consistent with the New Porgera project agreements and ensure that fair and equitable benefits reach all eligible landowners and the wider Porgera community, as well as provincial and national stakeholders.
“NPL stands ready to pay benefits directly to landowner households, without going through middlemen, once the CDA is executed. The mine would make additional infrastructure contributions to the project footprint area through effective use of the tax credit scheme in collaboration with local and provincial authorities,” Bristow said.
NPL employs 2,500 people, of whom 57 percent are from Porgera and Enga, 40 percent are from the rest of Papua New Guinea, and 3 percent are expatriates.
First gold, following the resumption of operations at the mine, was poured in January, electricity from the Hides power plant in Hela Province was restored in April and a throughput performance test agreed to with Papua New Guinea was achieved in June, four months ahead of schedule.
Bristow singled out the lack of law and order as the greatest threat to the continued operation and profitability of the mine, requiring the active support of all stakeholders to ensure that Porgera could continue to deliver benefits in line with its potential as a Tier One1 asset.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
Bunabun farmers encouraged to look into poultry,23/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/732,"Madang Provincial Livestock officer Paul Hubub of the Department of Agriculture and Livestock delved into the development aspects of poultry within the province during a Financial Literacy Training graduation in Village Banking of 60 farmers from wards one and two in the Bunabun village of Sumkar district.
The event was held at the Bunabun Primary School where for one week the participants learnt savings and banking for villagers. Since all the participants were farmers, they will be contributing towards their local business group of Kuawkanam Farmers.
According to Mr. Hubub, the Madang Poultry Project (MPP) is now in the awareness phase whilst it is anticipated that a downstream processing plant will be constructed for operations by 2027. He encouraged the farmers to seriously consider starting poultry farms in order to be a part of this lifechanging development.
Further to that Mr. Hubub stated that the project has lifted off the ground in 2023 and awareness is being carried out in districts and LLGs identified to participate.
1.	Sumgilbar LLG in Sumkar District
2.	Ambenob LLG in Madang District
3.	Astrolabe Bay LLG in Raicoast District, and
4.	Usino in Usino Bundi strict
Mr. Hubub explained that only certain ward areas within these districts and LLGs will participate due to the challenging terrains and remote locality of the villages.
The next phase of the project will be training and farmers are expected to gather in their cluster groups of Cooperative Societies in order for registrations to begin.
For Bunabun, the two cooperative societies interested farmers can join to participate are Sumgilbar Farmers and Wangil Cooperative Societies. They will have to gather up to at least 50 farmers in order to sign a solid contract with the Provincial Government to meet the demand and supply chain.
Downstream processing and commercialization of poultry has already been captured in the Medium-Term Development Plan IV 2023-2027 and has also been incorporated into the Provincial Strategic Development Plan recently launched in Madang.","Agriculture, Anticipation",Agriculture,Anticipation
Porgera mine reopening vital: Treasurer,23/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/731,"Treasurer, Ian Ling-Stuckey has clarified that the process of getting Porgera Mine into full production has been difficult, and the government continues to keep the budget under review in consistent with parliamentary appropriations.
He said the full operation of Porgera gold mine is important for the country.
He added that following some tough negotiations, the people of PNG, especially the people of Enga and Porgera, will now receive much higher benefits for decades into the future.
The government’s support for this process is reflected in the 2024 budget with K100 million set aside for the Porgera Infrastructure Development Grants.
Other forms of support have also been provided to the Porgera District.
“The required funding to support the re-opening has been provided. Revised warrants have been issued to cover this funding support.
“These revised warrants are all drawn from funding sources that do not affect other Provinces or Districts.
The treasurer clarified that the earlier warrant which was based on advice, has been withdrawn.
“The priority has been ensuring that funds for the Porgera re-opening were provided in a timely fashion.
Ling-Stuckey added that the Prime Minister wanted a successful mine re-opening; hence; Treasury, Finance and Planning are all working together to ensure that the funding is provided from the appropriate source.
“The revised warrant is drawing from sources that have no impact on the Business Development Grants or Infrastructure Development Grants provided to support other resource projects such as PNG LNG, Papua LNG or Wafi Golpu.
“Let me assure Governor Havieta that any concerns he may have had are now fully dealt with.
“No Business Development Grants (his legal note incorrectly refers to Budget Development Grants) or Infrastructure Development Grants from other Provinces or Districts are being used to support the re-opening of Porgera.
“In light of this, I do hope his concerns have been addressed and that we all can move forward together to continue addressing PNG’s development challenges,” stated the Treasurer.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

Black soldier fly technology introduced,18/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/686,"Papua New Guinea’s waste management issues and expensive animal feed challenges can potentially be addressed through the farming of black soldier flies.
A black soldier fly is sometimes confused with a wasp because of its sleek, black appearance.
This non-pest, versatile insect can be found in Papua New Guinea. While adult flies are harmless and do not feed, their larvae, or maggots, feed on a wide range of organic materials without emitting any smell, and can also be used as a protein-rich feed for animals, including fish, chickens and pigs.
Researchers and scientists from Kenya recently visited the country to propose the concept of black soldier fly farming, which has gained momentum in their country.
The delegation from Kenya was in Lae from July 1st-2nd.
The research program manager for livestock system with the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, Dr Anna Okello, outlined the progress made in Kenya since her tenure in the last seven years.
“So, livestock feed; how do we generate more feed? Almost 100 percent is imported across here in the Pacific,” said Dr Okello.
“How do you generate jobs for youth, how do we manage circular economy in waste management?
“We’ve got a huge problem with food waste in the world in general. This black soldier fly technology is addressing that.
“So, we work across the world and I was watching the technology develop in Kenya and I was thinking, ‘ok, how do we scale it out?’
“How do we learn lessons from one part of the world and apply them to others? So, this is where this reciprocal knowledge exchange came in.
“Let me see who’s interested in the Pacific and learning from East Africa. Two months ago, ACIAR took a delegation across from Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Fiji, to Kenya. They saw what was happening on the ground, they learnt from it and now, these people have come back to learn from Fiji, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea.
“So, this is the Papua New Guinea arm of the knowledge exchange visit. Hopefully, we will discuss more on how to move the concept forward here in the Pacific.”
The National Agriculture Research Institute co-hosted the international knowledge exchange visit that involved the Lae City Authority, where a visit was made to the temporary main market and the Second Seven landfill.","Agriculture, Anticipation",Agriculture,Anticipation
Big benefits from insect technology,18/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/685,"The benefits from the black soldier fly technology are immense.
The chief executive officer of InsectiPro, a Kenyan-based company focused on innovative insect farming, stressed on affordable high-protein feed for fish and animals, reliable and sustainable waste management and job creation.
“We’ve seen there’s a very robust animal industry, livestock industry here in PNG,” said Talash Huijbers, who started InsectiPro with the vision to reinforce food security in Kenya and Africa at large.
“More than 5 million animals (produced) annually. How are we feeding them? Right now, through imported feed. But Kenya, Papua New Guinea, globally, each country has the potential to take their wastes and transform it into something to feed their animals with local products.”
Currently, it is estimated that PNG imports 90 percent of feed, and the imports cost US$2.7 million (K10.4 million) per day.
“And then, more excitingly is the insect poop. It is very good fertiliser. We’re seeing very good yields on crops. You can make a nation more food secure with this tiny little insect.
“Also, more importantly, job creation. There is a lot of youth in Papua New Guinea, there is a lot of youth in Kenya. We can create jobs for everybody; not only managing the insects but all of the industries around it.
“For every 100 direct jobs, you’re creating 500 indirect jobs.”
Black soldier flies are one of the most efficient waste recyclers of the insect world.
The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research says: “Unlike common houseflies, black soldier flies don’t have mouths and are incapable of transmitting deadly diseases, posing minimal risk to human or animal health.”","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Kerowagi DDA sign MOU with Mama Bank,18/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/680,"The Kerowagi District Development Authority signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Mama Bank Ltd on Tuesday 17th July 2023, making a break through to have presence in the highlands region after having only an agent in Goroka, Eastern Highlands.
Local Member, Francis Siune committed K1million to assist in the establishment of Mama Bank in the district. The DDA also committed to allocating space for the bank to start on its activities.
It is a mutual collaboration for both the Mama Bank and the Kerowagi district to reach the ‘unbanked’ population as well as create opportunities for MSME business in the district.
Director for Mama Bank Ltd, Noel Norigku was pleased with the advancement of the bank’s move into the highlands. He said they had been waiting on the Prime Minister James Marape to fulfill his promise to take Mama Bank to Tari, Hela Province, however it is with joy that they welcome the Kerowagi DDA to partner with the bank.
He said moving to Kerowagi district is a strategic move towards the rest of the highlands region, as it is on the border of Jiwaka and will be easy to reach the other highlands provinces including Tari once the Member for Tari Pori and Prime Minister is ready.
Norigku explained that in terms of collaborating with DDAs this is not the first time in providing micro-finance and literacy at the basic business level. However there’s a lot of cost to cover in order for them to go out there. So with Kerowangi DDA coming on board, it is indeed a welcome gesture.
“We would provide the normal banking but as much as possible we would like to make impact into the rural area, the village population, where they must enjoy the banking services,” Norigku added
Meanwhile Member for Kerowagi Francis Siune expressed people’s desires to have a bank that is customer-friendly and conductive to the rural unbanked populace.
“We are trying to find a way to get institution like Mama Bank or some credit facility so it’s gonna be customer friendly so they can be able to do business. Small people can be able to find easy access to do business,” said Siune.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy

"Airfares increase a commercial suicide, says ICCC",17/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/663,"The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission says the increase in domestic airfare by Air Niugini will inflict more pain on the struggling airline.
This move will chase more loyal traveling public to another competing airline, while it will continue to experience low revenue to sustain its operations.
On Monday 15 July, Air Niugini announced that the airline is implementing an adjustment to domestic airfares effective that same day.
According to the airline’s official statement, “The airline is restructuring its airfares to create better value for the traveling public whilst ensuring a consistent delivery of safer airline services. Over the last twelve months the airline has faced a significant increase in the cost of fuel. The cost of airline supply chains both within PNG and globally has increased substantially, and Air Niugini is not immune from these cost increases. The cost of aircraft leases, spares and services sourced from overseas have increased significantly with global supply chain inflationary pressures and appreciating foreign currency value, against the Kina.”
ICCC Commissioner Paulus Ain Ain says whilst Air Niugini is thinking that it will cover costs and will make sufficient returns to sustain its operation by increasing the domestic airfares, this misleading conclusion; a decision that will see the airline losing more clients, traveling public, and loyal clients.
Ain is urging competing airlines not to follow suit, but to pick up on passengers who will likely move away from Air Niugini due to their domestic fare increase. Ain is also asking the traveling public to reconsider their traveling plans.
The ICCC is advising Air Niugini to reconsider its decision to increase domestic airfares, where it could consider increasing international airfares or spreading planned increases.
Price increases or airfare increases must be the last option and the ICCC strongly encourages the airline to reconsider.
ICCC is advising that Air Niugini identify cost-effective alternatives where it can utilize so it avoids losing customers.","Business, Disgust",Business,Disgust
A new era for Madang cocoa farmers,16/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/658,"A local cocoa farming group from the five districts of Madang banded together and established the Club3000 enterprise in 2022, which sought to find export markets available to promote their cocoa.
Their journey has been through many trials as they fought to be certified, and now have certification with Fair Trade. However, that did not make things smooth for them as during the years, they dealt with various middle cocoa buying establishments which have let them down countless times.
On Monday 15th July, they were pleased to present a potential partner to Governor Ramsey Pariwa. Rausch – the largest chocolate house in the world, located in Berlin, Germany.
The Rausch group comprising the CEO Robert Rausch who is the 5th generation of the Rausch family empire, Dr. Christina Rohsius who is the head of cocoa and research department and Torsten Mecklenburg the head of procurement and sales, were on a mission, touring the world to seek out quality beans for the chocolate house.
They have connected with Club3000 and have toured the cocoa fields of farmers in the South Ambenob region, inspecting the whole process of cocoa from planting to harvesting and the end product result. They were quite impressed with the quality of the farmer’s dried beans and have indicated a partnership in export trade.
This was welcoming news for Club3000 as during the 11 years of the group, due to lack of funding and support many farmers were discouraged from continuing, however, with a potential buyer at their disposal this could be life-changing for these farmers.
Rausch team and farmers gathered in Madang to present prospects to the Governor. The Governor was quite impressed and pleased that a mogul company could be dealing with the little people.
He has committed to allocate K1.1 million for cocoa farmers' programs to provide 100 seedlings each year for Madang people.
Pariwa added that since the beginning of this year, cocoa has been a lucrative commodity for farmers and rightfully speaking, it would be wise to invest in cocoa as it can be cultivated from the coastal to the mountainous regions of Madang as opposed to coffee and coconut which are restricted to certain climates.
He would like to see Madang people start investing in cocoa farming. Governor Pariwa also thanked Mr Rausch for seeking a partnership with Club3000 and assured the team that he would be delighted to prepare documentation for partnership purposes and in the future a possibility for downstream processing cocoa in the province.
Mr. Rausch and his team were overwhelmed with the farmer's processing efforts and assured them that if they all agreed to partner, they would be more than happy to buy off all the tons of cocoa beans produced as they had good quality and the potential to become one of the best in the world.
He added that they would also continue to support the farmers with resources and technical expertise in producing high-grade beans.","Business, Joy",Business,Joy

The second week of training will be held in Rabaul to cater for SMEs in Rabaul and the Gazelle districts.
Marai told the participants about SME funds which have been parked at the National Development Bank (NDB) and Bank South Pacific (BSP) for SMEs to access.
“K100 million is with BSP and another K17 million is with the NDB. So these two banks are part of this training, and they will come later this week to do workshops on how they (SMEs) may access these funds.”
ENB Provincial Administrator Levi Mano, urged the participants to be self-reliant and disciplined in their business dealings.
He said the ENB Provincial Government has also allocated K2 million each to Kada Poroman Microfinance Limited and ENB Savings and Loans Ltd.
“Your money is there for you to use, and this course is relevant because you will learn how to access all of these funds. Concentrate on what you can do and control, so that you can be successful,” he stated.
He further commended the Ministry of Commerce and Industry for rolling out the training in Kokopo and Rabaul.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Include PNG citizens in MVIL shares: Muthuvel,04/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/466,"Governor for West New Britain Sasindran Muthuvel has called on the government to prioritise Papua New Guineans in the sale of Motor Vehicle Insurance Limited’s (MVIL) shares in BSP Financial Group.
Muthuvel said that given the National Executive Council approved decision and is now a foregone conclusion, the next best step is to ensure Papua New Guineans do not lose shareholding in such an important commercial entity.
“I understand the government has indicated unofficially that its intention is to sell these shares to Papua New Guineans, but they must put this commitment on paper to properly assure the nation,” said Muthuvel. “Contradictory to these remarks, the NEC decision that gave effect to the selling of shares has no explicit directive to ensure these shares are exclusively sold to Papua New Guineans.
“Majority ownership of BSP shares are one of the biggest assets our country has to date. So we simply cannot let our troubling economic situation be the reason to make such rash decisions.
“But I respect NEC has decided to go down this path and we must adhere to their directives.
“So it is in this respect that I call on the government to commit to selling these shares locally – to the mums and dads of this nation, to the provincial governments and districts, and to local businesses.”
Mr Muthuvel also stated that the government must not forget the importance of PNG’s majority shareholding of BSP toward our economy, financial system, and commerce and industry livelihood.
“The government must be mindful not to rush this sale in its quest for cashflow for projects,” he said. “While foreign investors may throw big figures toward this share sale, we must remember the non-monetary value of BSP’s shares that allow us to safeguard our national interests.”
“I also remind the government that shares must be sold at market price and not be sold for less to ensure MVIL does not assume the liability.
“BSP is intrinsically PNG. And PNG’s reliance on BSP for jobs, economic growth and banking services makes us BSP’s biggest customer base.
“We must look at the full picture and the future impacts down the line if we do not handle this sale with caution and due diligence,” Mr Muthuvel said.
Muthuvel said in future, the government must be transparent with such decisions but urged that now that this decision has been made, PNG must be at the forefront of this sale.
Prime Minister James Marape in an earlier statement stated that the proposal to sell the MVIL BSP shares is part of the approach by KCHL to liquidate assets, where possible, to be able to beef up investments in other utilities such as power and water.
“Proceeds are earmarked to improve generation and transmission of power in Port Moresby and Lae. “This is a strategic balancing of loans from ADB for specific reforms, but liquidating assets for investment purposes.
“I want to assure everyone that there is no vested interest here,” said the Prime Minister.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

This phase of the project is being implemented in Port Moresby by the National Capital District Commission (NCDC) and in Lae by the Lae City Authority (LCA), targeting urban youths and those from the Motu Koita and Ahi areas.
In a significant move to support this initiative, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between the NCDC's Urban Youth Employment Project II and the Women’s Micro Bank.

System to enhance trade and investment,04/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/460,"An electronic system has been approved to be implemented to facilitate and enhance trade and investment in Papua New Guinea.
Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru announced that the electronic Single Window (eSW) System approved by the National Executive Council (NEC) will promote greater integration and cooperation among national agencies as well as countries, fostering a more conducive environment for trade and development.
Maru said the system aims to enable the electronic exchange of trade-related information and documents between government agencies, reducing the time and cost associated with trade to enable a paperless, electronic, online facility that will facilitate trade by reducing cost, time, and effort of fulfilling import and export requirements.
“We will have a computer system established in the national trade office that you can go online and apply for export and import of your goods. For example, if you want an export permit from NAQIA, all you have to do is just go online and apply for it, you don’t have to physically come to Moresby and see NAQIA. Payments will be done alone as well,” he said.
Maru said the development of the system will cover four main commodity sectors, Agriculture, Fisheries Mining, and Petroleum.
“Under this project what I would like to see is one single point of payment for whatever fees that are charged, and one point of submission of the export documents. This will ease the cost of exports and encourage investment and economic growth,” he said.
Maru added that the implementation of this system represents the progression of our country’s strive towards meeting the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement commitments as well as streamlining trade processes and fostering economic growth for our economy.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
IRC reveals GST-related fraud trends,03/07/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/448,"The Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) has revealed observations of fraudulent trends in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) declarations they have been receiving.
IRC Commissioner Sam Koim empahsizes that a tax return, whether signed by a taxpayer or a tax agent, is a binding declaration of the accuracy of the provided information. False declarations are not taken lightly and come with severe penalties. Koim says when a taxpayer is caught out, a common excuse seems to be: ""oh my former accountant failed me and did not file accurate returns.""
“We are not tolerating these kinds of excuses hence encourage taxpayers do the right thing in the first place and stay out of trouble.
“In response to the escalating instances of fraud, we have ramped up our vigilance, especially concerning GST credit returns.”
The troubling patterns detected by IRC include:
•	Related Party Transactions
•	Significant Variances Between GST and CIT, and
•	Cash Income Not Returned
Related Party Transaction
In response to this, Koim said, “We have uncovered multiple instances where related parties are fabricating invoices or supplies to artificially inflate their GST Suppliers' Listings. For example, Company A claims input credits from related entities B and C. These companies might not realize that we cross-check these input claims against third-party data, including Customs import records and bank transactions. Verification extends beyond possessing an invoice—it involves tracking cargo movements, financial transfers, and matching invoices. Furthermore, we ensure that the suppliers, such as Companies B and C, have declared this income in their tax returns.”
Significant Variances Between GST and CIT
“There are alarming discrepancies between GST declarations and Corporate Income Tax (CIT) returns. Certain taxpayers consistently report a credit position annually, which contradicts the nature of their business operations. Others show higher expenditures than earnings in their GST returns without corresponding income declarations in their CIT returns.
“We have also found numerous cases where taxpayers regularly file GST returns but neglect to submit their annual CIT returns. Some individuals declare income solely for GST refund purposes, leading to significant mismatches when CIT returns are not filed. Consequently, we are now issuing default CIT assessments based on the information provided in GST returns.”
Cash Income Not Returned
And in response to this,  Koim added, “We are also witnessing in the GST and CIT returns that most of the cash sales income are not declared. Some of those undeclared income finds its way in the expenditures listing, where taxpayer seems to spend more than the income declared. We have developed some matrix, including the launch of a project, to detect and penalise taxpayers for such evasive behaviour.”
In taking action, IRC Commissioner Koim stated, “Our newly established Tax Crime Division is actively investigating several GST-related fraud cases and will soon initiate prosecutions. Let this serve as a stark warning: we are intensifying our efforts to detect and address fraudulent behaviors. The IRC is unwavering in its commitment to safeguarding the integrity of our tax system.
“I encourage all taxpayers to do the right thing by making accurate declarations to the tax office.”","Business, Fear",Business,Fear

The Panguna – Lessons and Eye to the Future session, which will be held on day two of PNG Resources Week, will be chaired by PNG Chamber of Resources & Energy (PNG CORE) President, Anthony Smaré.
In announcing this session, President Smaré reaffirmed the importance of learning from the Panguna experience.
“The story of Panguna is critically important for our nation. Panguna itself provided the financial foundation for Papua New Guinea’s independence in 1975, and contributed immensely to the development of communities in Panguna, Bougainville, and in wider Papua New Guinea,” he stated.
“Whilst this project provided the necessary support to PNG, perceptions of unfair distribution of opportunities, especially from landowners, formed the basis of events leading up to the forced shutdown of this project, triggering a decade-long conflict on the island, and the loss of many lives.
“CANCONEX 2023 provided the very first opportunity for all stakeholders in the Panguna issue to come together, and speak openly about their challenges, and their willingness to work together, for the greater benefit of Bougainville.
“The Lessons from Closure session featuring Panguna was well received from all who attended, and this also provided the catalyst for significant progress to be made.
“In January this year, the ABG granted a 5-year exploration licence (EL01) over the former Panguna mine area to Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL). This has now allowed the company to undertake renewed Pre-Feasibility Studies (PFS) and Feasibility Studies (FS) before applying for an actual development licence. On the Community Affairs front, the Panguna Landowners Interim Council (PLIC) has been established as an interim body to represent the landowners.
“All this progress a direct result of CANCONEX 2023.
“In addition to our esteemed speakers representing landowners, and key community groups, the President of Autonomous Region of Bougainville, Ishmael Toroama, who is also ABG Minister Mineral and Energy, has been officially invited and will provide some insights into progress made.
“Given the importance of the subject matter, it will be the longest single session at CANCONEX24. The insights provided by our speakers from Panguna will be critical for our landowners, and our leaders from across Papua New Guinea.”

The new Centralised Operations approach has been launched, which will bring efficiency and quick turnaround times at branches.
Koisen said, “It took us one and a half years of meticulously planning and execution and we had in place a robust and effective project governance and management framework and with the support of our core banking system provider Oracle Flexcube, our implementation partner Profinch, our testing partner Yethi and our advisors Deloitte, we have successfully delivered this project.
“While we appreciate the external support, a critical piece to the successful delivery of this project is our Project Core team and TISA Technology team.
“They put in long hours and worked extremely hard and worked smart to ensure the project was delivered successfully and within time frames.”
The CEO says TISA thanks all their members, customers, and key stakeholders for supporting them through this project.
Koisen further stated, “While there are minor teething issues and slight customer service delays after the migration, which is normal; we have invested in training our people and we have a talented team that has readily embraced the change.
“I am confident in our team’s ability to adapt quickly, and our customers will experience improved services soon.
“I am incredibly proud of our teams, and how they adapted quickly to learning and change.”
He further added, “As part of TISA’s transformation and commitment to elevating our member and customer experience and fostering financial inclusion, we have introduced USSD Banking and enhanced Internet Banking services after the migration.
“We are also set to introduce several more innovative products onto the market in July.
“We have refurbished our main branches of Port Moresby, Lae, Kokopo, and Mt Hagen where banking services will commence once the banking license is granted.”","Business, Trust",Business,Trust

FAO promotes farming as a family business,21/06/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/278,"The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has equipped thirty government officers, partner organization staff, and lead farmers in the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea with innovative tools to promote gender equity and improve family farming incomes.
This initiative is part of the EU-STREIT PNG Programme.
Held in Maprik, East Sepik Province, the Training-of-Trainers (ToT) workshop introduced participants to the Gender Action Learning System (GALS) methodology.
The workshop, titled ‘Farming as a Family Business,’ aimed to create more inclusive, business-oriented, and sustainable family farms. Among the attendees were 12 women and 18 men from all six districts of the province.
The training featured practical tools such as the Vision Road Journey, Happy Family Tree, Increasing Income Tree, and Diamond Tree, which help families plan their futures, address gender-based violence, and boost incomes. These tools use symbols and inclusion principles to foster gender-equitable livelihoods and alter power dynamics.
Participants are now prepared to support farmers on gender issues and train Community Gender Advocates (CGAs), who will serve as permanent advisers in their communities. Positive feedback highlighted the transformative impact of the training.
Erick Mariha, a participant, shared, “My life has changed. I now have a cocoa farm and a vision for my family’s future.” Kathlyn Wangoro, an officer from the Provincial Division of Agriculture and Livestock, emphasized the importance of family collaboration, stating, “Every member in a house must talk together and share responsibilities to achieve a happy family and business.”
A social media group was created for these GALS champions to share their progress, with the final list of CGAs expected by June 2024.
Gender and Youth Inclusion Specialist Patu Shang, who facilitated the workshop, explained, “The household becomes the focus where everyone sets goals for their family farm and business. Gender balance is promoted to boost incomes through smart planning.”
The EU-STREIT PNG Programme will continue to use GALS to train gender advocates in West Sepik Province, promoting sustainable and equitable development of cocoa, vanilla, and fisheries value chains in the region.","Development, Joy",Development,Joy

Sepik visit to strengthen STREIT program,10/06/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/243,"The Department of National Planning and Monitoring (DNPM) recently visited East Sepik and West Sepik Provinces to carry out its independent assessment of the Support to Rural Entrepreneurship, Investment and Trade (STREIT) PNG Program.
With two weeks on their hands, the team led by First Assistant Secretary Corporate Governance and Compliance Division Jacob Areman and Programme Director of the NAO Support Unit Floyd Lala visited the EU-Streit support for Vanilla and cocoa growers in the area.
In 2019, the STREIT Programme Financing Agreement was signed between PNG and EU and rolled-out in 2020. DNPM is the co-chair of the Project Steering Committee.
STREIT aligned with the Medium-Term Development Plan III and is focused on supporting value-chains for cocoa, vanilla and fisheries (coastal and riverine, aquaculture).
According to DNPM, the objective is about increasing sustainable and inclusive economic development of rural areas through value chain development and enabling environment.
The meeting held two weeks ago was to inform the Provincial Administration of the assessment that will be conducted in the Sepik region.
The Provincial Administration acknowledged the positive impacts the region has experienced because of the program, like the increase in cocoa production and its economic strengths.
During the visit to Wewak last week, STREIT PNG assisted Mongs AgTrade Services Ltd which is a group of vanilla farmers from Mandi village by supplying 5 vanilla driers to boost the quality of their yield.
The team also visited the Brandi Secondary School ICT facility where the e-commerce, digital and marketing training for vanilla growers was conducted by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) under STREIT PNG. The team also visited the completed Yawasoro-Niengwainjie Road by EU-Streit, which will be handed over to the local government this week.

PNG’s economy predicted to grow,10/06/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/240,"A World Bank Report released on Thursday has indicated that PNG’s economy is forecast to accelerate in 2024 after a slowdown last year, yet greater investment in education is critical to the country’s long-term economic future.
According to the report, economic growth is expected to rise to 4.8% this year from 2.7% in 2023 after the reopening of the Porgera gold mine, but growth is expected to remain below its pre-pandemic trajectory.
Papua New Guinea’s economy is gradually recovering from the impacts of the pandemic and economic growth is expected to accelerate in 2024 due to the resumption of the Porgera gold mine, although growth could have been higher if not for the riots and looting in January and fuel supply disruptions.
World Bank Senior Economist for Papua New Guinea, Ruslan Piontkivsky when giving his speech at the World Bank Economic Update in Port Moresby on Thursday said macroeconomic policies have improved with the government carrying out fiscal consolidation plans to reduce risks of debt distress and the Bank of PNG allowing more exchange rate flexibility.
“The COVID-19 crisis led to an economic contraction in 2020-21 before recovering by 5.2 percent in 2022. The recovery in the extractive sector was driven by significant improvement in international prices of key export commodities, although the shutdown of the Porgera gold mine limited the rebound.
“Growth is estimated to have slowed down to 2.7 percent in 2023, primarily attributed to reduced global demand and domestic supply constraints stemming from scheduled maintenance in extractive facilities.”
While the economy is recovering, the analysis underscores that the benefits of growth in PNG over the last decade have not been shared by all, and the poorest in Papua New Guinea have not seen significant welfare improvements.
Meanwhile, according to the latest World Bank–IMF DSA, the country remains at high risk of debt distress depending on the implementation of the Government’s plans for further fiscal consolidation and conservative financing strategies.","Economy, Anticipation",Economy,Anticipation
Nasfund Announces 2023 Full Year Results,08/03/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/184,"National Superannuation Fund Limited (Nasfund) is pleased to announce its audited results for the year 2023.
The 2023 audited financial statements were approved by the Trustee Board at its meeting on Thursday, March 7th, 2024. These statements reported a Net Asset Value (NAV) of K7 billion and a notable net profit after tax of K597 million for the year ending December 31, 2023.
Following these results, the Nasfund Board has approved an interest crediting rate of 9 percent for the 2023 financial year. This decision will result in the distribution of more than K584 million which will be allocated into over 680,000 member accounts this weekend.
It's also worth noting that an interim credit rate amounting to K9.4 million has been proactively allocated to members who have exited the Fund during the year.
Chairwoman, Tamzin Wardley on behalf of the board, expressed her pleasure with the Fund's performance, highlighting its resilience and ability to surpass expected levels in contributions, cash income, and drive operational cost management.
“It is wonderful to be able to announce some great news for our members, in what has been a difficult time for many.”
The positive financial outcomes were significantly influenced by key factors such as above budget performance in cash income, and valuation gains of K 180m, a substantial improvement compared to the loss of K44m last year. Additionally, a net foreign exchange gain of K85m was recorded, in contrast to a loss of K40m in the prior year. These factors contributed to a total valuation gain of    K265 m which equates to 4.08 percent of the 9 percent crediting rate for the members this year.
Our crediting rate for 2023 of 9 percent, underscores our dedication to providing strong and stable returns to our members above CPI over a rolling five-year period, which on average is 6.12 percent compared to 4.92 percent CPI average over the same time during 2019 to 2023.
This performance underlines our dedication to ensuring the financial well-being and confidence of our members, and we look forward to this positive trajectory in the future.
Main highlights for FY2023 include:
• Cash income of K485 million compared to budget of K432 million (FY22: K493 million income)
• Valuation gain of K180 million (FY22: K44 million loss)
• Foreign currency gain of K84 million (FY22: 40 million loss)
• Expenses of K74 million compared to budget of K82 million (FY22: K72 million)
• Net profit before valuation of K415 million against Budget of K278 million
• Net profit after tax of K597 million (FY22: K256 million)
• Total assets of K7.13 billion (FY22: K6.35 billion)
• Net assets of K7.07 billion (FY22: K6.30 billion)
• Employer receipts of K706 million, 9 percent higher than collected in 2022 (FY22: K650 million)
• Member withdrawals of K534 million (FY22: K546 million)
• 34,415 new members registered resulting in a 5 percent increase in total membership to 688,169 members (FY22: 653,754)
Gross employer base increased by 7 percent to reach 3,585 employers (FY22: 3,020), 905 shop floor presentations covering 26,163 members / potential members compared to 771 conducted in 2022. Reserve 31 m to 34 m
According to a statement from Nasfund, the future of PNG’s economy remains cautiously positive, performance will be underpinned by a projected recovery in the extractive sector.
Nasfund as an investor and landlord sees extraordinarily improved performance when the country’s resource projects are operational, as it improves the property portfolio in terms of value and rental income and increases contributions due to a larger workforce.
“Throughout the year, while there were economic challenges, it's important to recognize the resilience and strategic adaptations made by our team. Despite the increased tax on the tier one banking sector, which rose from 30 percent to 45 percent in January 2023 and had a significant influence on Nasfund, our financial acumen helped us mitigate the impact to a loss of around K20 million or 0.31 percent of the annual crediting rate for FY 23.”
“Additionally, although we experienced a 3 percent decline in yields on Government securities in 2022, impacting our FY 23 results with a reduced interest income of K30m or 0.46 percent, our strategic response and portfolio adjustments have been proactive and thoughtful,” says Nasfund.
“Our Strategic Assets Allocation (SAA) for international investments is currently at 11.85 percent of Net Asset Value, which is well within both the prudential standard limit of 35 percent and the board-approved limit of 15 percent.
“The limited availability of foreign exchange continues to restrict our ability to fully capitalize on international opportunities, it's worth noting the potential benefits had we been able to invest fully. Investing the full 15 pecent in international markets could have generated an additional K41.7m million in income, translating to a 0.64 percent increase in crediting rate.”
Nasfund stated that this scenario underscores the substantial opportunities that lie ahead as it continues to navigate and adapt to the evolving economic landscape.
“The investment division will intensify efforts to identify and assess opportunities in FY24 while remaining vigilant in monitoring market conditions and adjusting our investment as needed to ensure we are maximizing returns for our members while also managing risk.”","Business, Joy",Business,Joy

Goodman Fielder Calls for Commercial Corn Industry in PNG,08/03/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/180,"GFI Managing Director, Sun Xing Tao made this call during the visit of the Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru and NARI team to GFI’s new feed mill at 11 Mile in Lae on Tuesday.
“With our new USD200 million worth world-class feed mills we can produce chicken and pig feed as good as anywhere in the world depending on what the farmers want. Right now, we are safe importing wheat as our basic ingredient for feed, however, our big challenge is that we wait for over a month for our order to arrive and it is very expensive because of the declining value of the Kina.
“We are willing to substitute to a corn-based diet and buy all the corn that local farmers can produce so we can reduce imports of wheat for feed. The Government must support us by establishing a commercial corn industry so we can fully utilize our feed mill whose current under-utilized capacity is around 6, 000 metric tons per month (72, 000 metric tons per year) which is more than enough to replace all importation of poultry feed,” said Sun.
Minister Maru encouraged GFI to negotiate an MoU with NARI to go into large-scale commercial corn farming to supply feed to GFI feed mill
“PNG imported over 49, 000 metric tons of feed last year. We have to stop importing by going into large-scale commercial corn farming so we can stop spending over K70 million annually to import feed alone- this money should be going into our people’s pockets.
“The market and the capacity are already here but we are not producing. Once we start using local feed, we will ban all the imports of feed so we can support the local industry,” said Minister Maru.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Maru Congratulates Muruk Tropical Produce Limited,08/03/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/174,"Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru during his visit to Lae on Tuesday met and congratulated the Managing Director of Muruk Tropical Produce Limited.
Anna Wissink for exporting Papua New Guinea (PNG) frozen taros to selected markets in the United State of America (USA) and Australia.
Wissink has been buying fresh taros from the farmers in the five districts of Morobe Province that is Nawaeb, Huon Gulf, Markham, Finschhafen and Lae, and Mt. Hagen for export.
“We have been receiving requests from taro farmers across the country who want to sell their taros to us, but high freight cost is a serious issue that we are struggling with. The taros are there- they are locked up in the village; we cannot move them to the market because of the freight cost. Our market in the USA wants us to supply eight 20-feet reefer of frozen taros a month- that is how big the market is.
“Our selling price for a 20-feet reefer (14 tons of frozen taro) to the USA is K136, 000 and to Australia is K126, 000. The market is there, the demand is there, the supply is there, and the farmers are willing to participate but freight is a serious issue,” said Wissink.
Wissink requested the Department of Agriculture to look at the demand for taro, the cost of freight, and the level of subsidies that could be provided for taro alone to support taro farmers.
“We need the Government’s immediate assistance to this infant export industry by ways of freight subsidy,” said Wissink.
Minister Maru said he would take the request up with the Agriculture Minister.
Minister Maru said, “Our short-term goal is to provide freight subsidy for taro alone and the long-term goal is to go into large-scale commercial taro farming in Morobe and expand to other provinces as the demand grows.
“The last thing we want is to kill the market opportunity by not being able to deliver more taros to meet the demand because it is difficult to get the taro to Lae due to the high cost of freight. We need to support our SMEs like Muruk Tropical Produce Limited and our taro farmers just like how we have supported our coconut, coffee, and cocoa farmers in the freight subsidy.”","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
APEC Advances Cleaner Energy Transition,04/03/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/159,"APEC member economies are laying the groundwork for a cleaner energy transition within the region through a series of initiatives related to green and low-carbon hydrogen.
During a policy dialogue held last week in Lima, Romulo Mucho, Peru’s Minister of Energy and Mines, urged member economies to advance sustainable economic growth and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and seek to integrate efforts to achieve these goals collaboratively and efficiently.
“Energy is what makes all progress possible. Energy is also the foundation on which our economies are built,” Minister Mucho said.
“However, we are also aware of the climate threats we face, which are mainly caused by the current energy systems and in that sense, it is imperative to consider an efficient and conscious use of our energy resources.
“Being energy efficient does not mean depriving ourselves of our safety and comfort. It’s about using energy wisely and effectively,” added Minister Mucho. “This allows us to save inputs, be more competitive, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as preserve natural resources and the environment.”
As the host of APEC 2024, Peru has put sustainable growth as one of its main priorities for the year, specifically looking at promoting clean energy transition. It has identified green and low-carbon hydrogen as the focus because of its potential as a future energy source.
“The development of green and low carbon hydrogen stands out as one of the most promising energy sources of our future,” said Renato Reyes, Peru Senior Official for APEC, in his opening remarks at the policy dialogue.
“There is a recognition of the relevance of low carbon hydrogen as an energy vector to decarbonize various sectors of the energy system, particularly its role for hard to abate sectors such as industry and heavy transport, and its potential in the domestic use and as a trade product,” Reyes added.
The policy dialogue heard from experts and industry leaders on the latest trends and frameworks that can effectively support, catalyze, and enhance cooperation for APEC economies' adoption of the green hydrogen and low-carbon value chain.
Participants explored key strategies and collaborative efforts that can drive the development and implementation of green and low-carbon hydrogen policies, including looking at emerging technologies, standards and requirements to produce hydrogen, as well as defining what constitutes as low-carbon hydrogen.
Glen Sweetnam, senior vice president of the Asia Pacific Energy Research Centre (APERC), presented examples of low-carbon hydrogen policies across 21 APEC member economies. Sweetnam highlighted that some economies emphasize their ability to produce low-carbon hydrogen, while others emphasize the role of hydrogen for decarbonization of energy end-use and power sector.
Speakers at the policy dialogue also stressed that reducing the cost for low-carbon hydrogen is key to spur the transition, highlighting that the growth in wind and solar energy is mainly due to the significant reduction of its cost in the last 15 years.
Amalia Pizarro from the International Energy Agency and Elizabeth Font from Cadeo underlined the mismatch between low-carbon energy projects that have been announced and how those projects do not necessarily attract off-takers. They said that some sort of incentives are needed to address this.
As part of the commitment to advancing the policy dialogue and the work on clean energy transition forward, Peru is proposing an APEC policy guidance to develop and implement low-carbon hydrogen policy frameworks in the Asia-Pacific. The policy guidance aims to make the case for economies to move into the production and development of this energy source in a coherent manner.
Peru will host the 14th APEC Energy Ministerial Meeting in Lima in August.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

According to Project Manager Denson Javohn, they have a total of 67, 000 members from all six districts and is still increasing, indicating that the interest in balsa commercialization is very high. Javohn hopes this number is enough to create a market base in Madang Province, demonstrating the potential of a promising supply to meet the export demand, just like East New Britain Province.
Mr Javon says, that after the establishment of the Co-operative Society, they would progress onto working towards having a mill set up.
Other plans include a survey to assess the capability of farmers to meet the export demand. About 10 million seedlings are planned to be distributed throughout the province.
Bogia is currently leading in balsa cultivation with over 115, 000 trees in the Almami Local Level Government. This is a result of an awareness conducted by Isidor Gemon after witnessing the benefit gained from balsa in East New Britain Province.
Mr. Gemon is the Vice President for Almami LLG in Bogia District and started advocating in 2001 for his people to plant balsa trees. By 2002, many villagers started planting balsa trees. They are now excited about the development of the Balsa Co-operative Society as they see themselves as the first lot of sellers who will bring the market to Madang Province.
Gemon alone has over 6000 trees on his land and continues planting every three months so that if all goes well, he has the supply to meet the demand of the export market. He initially wanted to plant and sell matured trees to Rabaul, however, he is now patiently waiting for the Madang Balsa Co-operative Society to be established so he can sell his harvest through this society.
Madang Urban’s Deputy District Administrator, Mercy Timaus who also was a participant, advised farmers of Madang Urban LLG that the administration has captured Balsa in their District Plan for project funds in alignment with MTDP IV.
He urged farmers to seek funding opportunities once their budget is approved to help them implement their balsa projects. Mr. Timaus also encouraged other districts to ensure they allocate funding for balsa under their plans, as this will have a big impact on the Province’s revenue once the project kicks off.
East New Britain is the only province exporting balsa in the country.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
MRA to ramp up exploration,29/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/149,"The government has initiated two major intervention programs to address the declining exploration activities over the last five years and the potential closure of all major mines by mid-2060.
The government through the Mineral Resource Authority will now invest in new exploration data as infills and research for new mineral deposits in new frontiers.
New Mining Minister Muguwa Dilu announced this today in a media conference in Port Moresby.
The extractive industry has always accounted for more than 80 percent of the total export revenue of PNG.
However, it is worth noting that the potential end of mine life for many existing projects in the country for gold mines is by 2053, and copper mines by 2065.
This means the government needs new exploration data to attract new investors to develop new projects beyond 2060 for gold and 2065 for copper respectively.
Managing Director of MRA, Jerry Gary is concerned about PNG, there is no new project identified to sustain the mining sector of the country beyond 2065.
“From the schedule provided by operating mines and projects likely to come on stream, we would have all the mines closing up by around 2065. And when we look at what we call the mineral inventory in the country – that is what are the next major projects that will sustain the mining business in the country, there is none. After we commission Wafi Golpu and Frieda River, there will be no major projects in the country.
But the MD is sure there are deep-seated minerals that need to be explored.
“But we know for certain that there are deep-seated bodies in the country that are yet to be explored.
“Lead time from discovery to commissioning can take 15-50 years. Frieda River project was discovered in 1967 but is still a project after 55 years and that’s the lead time I am talking about.”
“So we have to start investing in finding the next generation of wealth to sustain the mining industry in the country. That is very critical. So from Mineral Resource Authority, we know that there are deep-seated bodies, how do we find those bodies?”
MRA has taken steps to address this gap and invested in seismic reflection technology to help collect data.
“We believe that if we run this, some of these areas with promising deep-seated bodies, we may be able to detect the structures and also give us the confidence to drill in precision.
“I went on to purchase that equipment in Canada and is now MRA property. Our engineers and geoscientists have been sent to US. They’re back and we’re cutting the lines for the first shooting down at Dawadawa. By April we should be able to shoot the first seismic reflection survey,” Gary elaborated.
The government through the Ministry of Mining is also looking at legislative reforms to address this growing concern.
“If you don’t explore, you don’t have mines. You only have mines when you continue to invest in exploration.
“Once we have big projects like Frieda which production will end in 2065, we will not have major mines because there’s no exploration currently going on. For a project to commence in 2060, you have to start exploring now.
“So this is the challenge we face and as the minister, I will work with MRA and Mineral Policy and Geohazards dept to ensure that we come up with a very aggressive exploration program for the country.“
Minister Dilu added that the government is also looking seriously into Alluvial mining and will also implement legislative changes to empower alluvial miners.
“It’s an important sector that needs attention from the government. In 2021, the Marape Rosso government endorsed the alluvial policy for alluvial miners in the country and they reserved that business. That business is reserved only for locals.
Locals should be the ones doing the mining and what we are doing now is t to ensure that it is listed as a reserved business under IPA, and we will also ensure to work with the Central Bank to ensure that those who are exporting are also locals.”
MD Gary says alluvial mining alone produces 100 thousand ounces of gold per year, which is equivalent to smaller mines like Simberi and K92 Mining and the state is determined to support this operation to increase this output.
“The total gold production from the alluvial sector has been averaging around 100 thousand ounces per annum. That’s from those alluvial miners who are using Swiss Boxes and pans. This is the most important SME sector in the country. Now after using the Swiss Boxes and Pans, this is the maximum production they can put.
“The state is now looking at piloting mechanized mining. Buy equipment and support four or five pilot projects in the country to help artisanal miners go into mechanized mining. Once we do that, we can double or triple the output from the alluvial sector,” Gary stressed.
Meantime, immediate legislative reforms that need to be made in the next session of parliament is the amendment to a section of the Mining Safety Act to include female mine workers work in underground mining and the extension of the Exploration License from two years to five years.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Unitech students gain Industrial Training,29/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/145,"Six final-year students from the Mining and Mineral Processing Department at the University of Technology (Unitech) in Lae have commenced industrial training with Ramu NiCo Management (MCC) Ltd in Madang Province.
While welcoming the students, Ramu NiCo Human Resources Manager Jeffers Teargun Heptol said Ramu NiCo was pleased to collaborate with the University of Technology to provide such training opportunities for students.
Mr. Heptol encouraged the students to take such opportunities and learn as much as they could.
“Ramu NiCo’s mining and refinery establishments are of world standard yet complex and that provides a massive opportunity for you to explore and learn new things to enhance your career pathways,” Mr. Heptol told the curious trainees.
The Registered Mining Manager for Ramu NiCo’s Kurumbukari Mine site Joseph Umare said the students will be attached to the mining section and washing and beneficiation plants.
“The company uses two different methods to extract laterite ore with conventional mining on one hand and the hydro slicing method on the other hand. Students will have the opportunity to explore and experience such complex mining operations,” he said.
The student's team leader David Duks who hails from the Middle Ramu electorate in Madang spoke on behalf of the students, thanking Ramu NiCo for recognizing the University’s requirement and allowing the students to undergo industrial training which is undoubtedly a much-needed program.
The university requires every engineering student to undergo a maximum of 450 hours of industrial training before receiving their degree certificates.
Dr. Jim Lem, the industrial training coordinator from the Department of Mining and Mineral Processing at Unitech thanked Ramu NiCo for its continuous collaboration in providing training and employment opportunities for PNG students and graduates.","Education, Trust",Education,Trust
Minister Daki impressed with Japanese investors,29/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/144,"Minister for Commerce and Industry, Win Bakri Daki through the Papua New Guinea Investment Promotion Authority (IPA) has praised the 50 member delegation from Japan who are currently in the country seeking business and investment opportunities.
Minister Daki told the investors that even though PNG has been hitting the media for the wrong reasons recently, these issues did not deter the plans and intentions of the business delegation to come to PNG.
“We are honored and humbled to have you with us during our challenging times. Your visit signals a great message to the outside world that PNG’s problems are not unique to what’s happening around the world and it adds to our endeavour to rebuild investor confidence and demonstrate that PNG is still open for business.” Minister said.
He was pleased with the discussions held during the forum and as Minister responsible for Commerce and Industry he said he was confident that the B2B, B2G and G2G discussions would be beneficial for both the Japanese and PNG side.
“I will be working with my Ministry after this forum to ensure that there is continued dialogue to maintain trade and bilateral arrangements between PNG and Japan.
“I will also use this forum to propose to the Prime Minister James Marape for a business delegation to accompany him to Japan when he attends the Pacific Islands Leaders Meeting (PALM) later this year. This is the commitment I intend to take up as the Minister responsible for Commerce and Industry in Papua New Guinea.”
The theme of the public-private economic mission was: Co-creation by the Japanese and PNG private sectors for a balanced promotion of various industries that contribute to sustainable economic development in PNG.
The sectors of interest from the Japanese side include Energy, Infrastructure, Tourism and Environment and Agriculture. For agriculture, discussions will be on cultivating distinctive agricultural products and building resilient supply chains to increase profitability and revitalize local communities.
In tourism, the focus will be on fostering a sustainable tourism industry in collaboration with the environmental   industry, aiming to preserve and harmonize with the rich natural environment

Major plans for NIP fisheries sector,29/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/140,"New Ireland fisheries will undergo a major redevelopment to tap into its vast tuna and marine resources.
Approved by the Provincial Executive Council at its meeting on Tuesday, February 24th, Deputy Governor and Chairman of the Fisheries Committee, Sammy Missen, announced the successful outcome of an intensive screening and deliberation process.
The successful bidder and investor for the project, PNG FJ Enterprises Limited, will go into a joint venture business partnership with the provincial government business arm, New Ireland Development Corporation (NIDC).
Missen informed the PEC that four reputable companies had applied through the Fisheries Committee and underwent a rigorous screening process. After going through the screening process, PNG FJ Enterprises Limited met all the requirements and was selected. PNG FJ Enterprise Ltd has a clear objective to revamp the fisheries industry in New Ireland, open a market and create a source of income for fishermen across the maritime province.
New Ireland was the major fishing province in the mid-seventies up to the late eighties, ahead of Madang Province when American fishing company StarKist established a big fleet of fishing ships and a fish filleting, processing and smoke factory on Nango Island.
Under the new joint venture approved by PEC, NIDC will secure 20 percent free equity in the shareholding and have the option to acquire another 10 percent in future.
Missen said PNG FJ will lease the inshore fish processing facility in Kavieng for six months and thereafter, review the lease agreements subject to performance and market indicators.
“We have confidence in the investor because it has shown initial commitment and has the financial resources and capacity to venture into the fisheries business,” stated Missen.
“The shareholding of PNG FJ is made up of existing successful business houses already operating in Kavieng and Papua New Guinea. It is a sign of investor confidence, especially at this time of political insecurity.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Maru raises fisheries concerns at WTO conference,29/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/139,"International Trade and Investment Minister, Richard Maru in his statement to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement said the Pacific Region has every reason to be concerned about the future of the fisheries industry.
Maru says 50 percent of the world’s tuna is supplied by the Pacific Island States, with PNG accounting for 10 percent of the world’s supply.
“For the Pacific, we are concerned about overcapacity and overfishing because of the harmful effects that it will have in depleting all our fisheries resources, hence we cannot allow anyone to destroy the industry. The Fisheries Subsidies Agreement must safeguard the interest of the Pacific Region not only because we own and supply 50 per cent of the world’s tuna but because most of our island countries’ only renewable and sustainable resource is their fisheries resources.”
Minister Maru says the Pacific Region cannot continue to allow a fisheries regime where few distant water-fishing nations continue to exploit our resources in an unsustainable manner by providing subsidies that result in overcapacity and overfishing.
“Destroying our fisheries means destroying the lives of our people, destroying our current and future generations, destroying our economies, and destroying our livelihood. We will ratify the agreement only when we are happy with the text because it is our responsibility as the custodians of the healthy fishing stocks on earth to make sure that it is responsibly harvested so that the world will continue to have fish supplies now and into the future,” said Minister Maru to set the context of his statement yesterday at the WTO 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
Minister Maru fully supported the statements made by Fiji and Samoa who spoke on behalf of the Pacific ACP Member States and also thanked Australia, India, Bangladesh and the African nations for strongly supporting the position of the Pacific Island States and for their appeal to the WTO to hear the plight of the Pacific Island nations.
“For us the bottom line is this: Papua New Guinea and all our Pacific Island States continue to demand that the additional provisions must include a standstill and a rollback for the top subsidizers which mirrors the commitment we have all made in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14.6. In W10 this would be a new A.1.1(d). Without a standstill and rollback for the Tier 1 members, the negotiations will be a failure,” said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru further stated, “We appreciate the negotiations, however, there are several pertinent issues that I wish to raise regarding disciplines to Overcapacity and Overfishing in Article A, Special and Differential Treatment in Article B and Transparency and Notification in Article C. If we are to deliver on SDG 14.6, we need a pragmatic, concise and credible agreement that will eliminate certain forms of subsidies that contribute to Overcapacity and Overfishing.”","Global, Fear",Global,Fear
IRC and ICSA join forces to combat tax evasion,29/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/134,"The Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) and Immigration and Citizenship Services Authority (ICSA) have embarked on a collaborative effort to tackle work permit violations and tax evasion in Papua New Guinea.
IRC launched a project called “Project Masta”, initially aimed at addressing tax evasion schemes by foreign workers and local group employers.
The initial investigations revealed that foreign workers would come on a work visa sponsored by one company but then end up working for multiple companies.
There are also instances where foreign workers are paid through their overseas bank accounts but paid a lousy living allowance here in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to evade taxes.
To facilitate this, dual contracts—external and local—were sometimes utilized. Furthermore, instances were discovered where foreign workers entered PNG on business visas to work in inline positions as employees, thereby evading tax.
Significant mismatches were uncovered between the number of foreign workers holding work visas and the group employee declarations submitted to the IRC.
Recognizing the severity of these issues, the IRC and ICSA have intensified collaboration efforts.
This commitment was reinforced during a meeting between Acting Chief Migration Officer, Wellington Navasivu, and Commissioner General Sam Koim. Building upon an existing Memorandum of Understanding, the agencies have united to address these challenges effectively.
The decision to initiate a joint operation under Project Masta follows a recent incident involving a major mining company that faced penalties for its involvement in tax evasion practices.
Through a thorough examination, the IRC meticulously scrutinized 1,187 employees over nine years spanning from 2015.
This investigation revealed that specific employees occupying key positions within a mining company entered the country using short-term business visas, raising concerns regarding compliance with immigration and tax regulations.
During the joint announcement, Commissioner General Sam Koim emphasized, ""The type of visa has significant tax implications.
IRC is initiating several projects to curtail the level of revenue leakages and close the tax gap, and this is one of the projects. Companies that employ foreign workers, and foreigners who come to this country to earn an income, must comply with our tax laws.""
He further stated, ""Our highly trained officers will be conducting audits, and once found liable, will be penalized severely hence let this be a stern warning to all. IRC now has highly skilled auditors and data analysts to dissect and analyze mass data to establish whether foreign workers employed by resident companies had breached the law.”
Acting CMO Navasivu emphasized, “Employers are once again being reminded of their responsibility to ensure that all employees, including those on business visas, are properly authorized to work under the laws of this country, including the tax laws and the immigration laws and to strictly comply with their work permit conditions.
“Failure to comply with these regulations may result in severe penalties, including fines, deportation, and other legal consequences.”
He further assured, ""ICSA will work closely with IRC to address the significant incidences of breach of work visas and tax laws.""
All businesses and individuals must review their obligations regarding employment authorization and tax compliance. If you have any questions or concerns regarding these matters, please contact the IRC or seek professional guidance from a qualified tax advisor.","Business, Trust",Business,Trust
Vanilla World Association to be established,28/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/131,"A world association for vanilla has been agreed upon at the World Trade Organization (WTO) 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The Trade Ministers for Papua New Guinea (PNG), Madagascar, and Comoros agreed in their three-way bilateral meeting yesterday that they would work together to establish a world association for vanilla-growing nations.
The association was proposed by Madagascar, which is currently the world’s leading vanilla-producing country leading the global market with over 60 percent of exports and generating approximately USD1 billion a year for the country.
Madagascar Minister for Industrialization, Trade and Consumption, Edgard Razafindravahy said, “This organization will address the issue of price instability, sustainable development of the industry, threats to the value chain, search for new markets, and production of natural vanilla to consumers around the world.”
Razafindravahy says the creation of the organization will make it possible to establish a mechanism for setting prices according to quality and in terms of sustainable development, the organization will promote sustainable practices that will not only guarantee vanilla quality but also fair income for farmers.
He added, “Through this organization, we can also strengthen the value chain which includes the development of strategic partnerships, search for new markets for natural vanilla, and development of the vanilla industry. The organization will also be a powerful tool for promoting natural vanilla worldwide and raising consumer awareness on responsible vanilla consumption.”
PNG Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru says PNG is keen to join the association as one of its foundation members if the association would look at increasing prices for the farmers to encourage them to plant vanilla and grow the industry on a long-term sustainable basis instead of the constant too frequent fluctuations which has been very discouraging for farmers in PNG.
Minister Maru also asked Madagascar the world's leading vanilla-producing country to assist PNG by providing technical support in terms of farmer training, improving the quality of vanilla, and helping to build the industry in PNG.
Minister Maru said: “We need processing technology to maintain quality at the highest level and the farmers need to be trained so they do not harvest the beans when they are not ready to be harvested. Another issue is the market for our vanilla.
“In PNG, we have a land border with Indonesia, so our farmers just walk across the border and sell the beans to Indonesian buyers, but they do not know if they are selling their vanilla beans at the correct price or not because they are not aware of world market prices, who is offering what prices, and how to access those global markets.”
He said that the association is only worth forming if the volume and demand for natural vanilla will grow because the most serious threat to the growth of the industry is artificial vanilla. The association will have to work hard to ensure that people will continue to prefer natural vanilla so that the industry can grow into the future.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

ICCC commences nationwide price inspection,27/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/116,"The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) has commenced its second phase of price surveillance enforcement exercise this week.
Chief executive Officer of ICCC, Paulua Ain announced this in a press conference today reminding all wholesalers and retail shops throughout the country of this exercise.
The first leg of the operation began today in the National Capital District with other centers to follow soon. Almost eight ICCC staff are involved in this exercise.
This operation will see all shops inspected in the nation’s capital to ensure that the prices collected previously by the ICCC during its first phase have not been increased above ten per cent without prior approval. The prices relate to the prices of the declared goods listed under Schedule 1 of Price Controls No.4 (Measure No.4).
CEO, Paulus Ain says any retail or wholesale business that fails to comply with the measure or has not sought prior approval from the ICCC will be issued with an Infringement Notice (IN) and a fine of K10,000. The ICCC will not be hesitant to take legal action against those who fail to comply with the infringement notice.
This price surveillance enforcement is being conducted under Measure No.4 issued under the National Pandemic Act 2020 on 30 March 2023, by the Office of the Controller.
The ICCC is encouraging all retailers or wholesalers that have not yet applied for any price increase of more than 10% on the listed goods on Schedule 1 to submit their price application to the ICCC for approval before the operation teams inspect their shops.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
PNG maintains position on Fishing Subsidies,27/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/105,"Papua New Guinea will maintain its position to standstill on fisheries subsidies.
Minister for International Trade and Investment, Richard Maru indicated this to his counterparts from Pacific ACP who had gathered in Abud Dhabi, United Arab Emirates for the World Trade Organization (WTO) 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13).
Minister Maru in the Pacific ACP WTO Trade Ministers Briefing last week said: “We own the resources, but we keep being used because we have no capacity and we have never really had a vision to rise up. We have been used and larger fishing nations think that they can continue to come and walk over us. The time has come for us to rise up and we need to start giving them a signal that the days of using our resources and using us just for our resources has to be a thing of the past. For PNG we are in transition.”
Maru updated that PNG will for the first time in our history introduce an export tax to all fishing companies that bring out unprocessed fish from local waters starting in July this year.
“We are also now negotiating to buy into a major fishing company in PNG with the view to owning our own vessels and fishing our own waters. We are very determined to domesticate our fishing industry, and we are hoping that the negotiations will conclude in the next two to three months and for the first we will start to own a company and build our own processing facilities in a very big way.
“We are going to declare the proposed Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) in Madang a free trade zone. We will give tax incentives to every company who wants to build their own processing facilities in the PMIZ including those from the Pacific Region. We already have a wharf, and we are working on servicing all the vessels and we are going to start work in a very serious way starting this year. We cannot continue to be rent collectors; that has to be a policy of the past. We have had enough; the time for change has come and PNG is prepared to lead that change,” Maru said.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 14.6) stipulated that certain fishing subsidies cause environmental and economic harm and must be prohibited. The Agreement of Fisheries Subsidies (AFS) concluded at MC12 in June last year at Geneva aimed to address two pillars of the three pillared problem- subsidies to illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing and subsidies to fishing on overfished stocks.
“It did not cover subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing (OCOF) which has always been the most commercially important third pillar of the longstanding negotiations. At MC12, Ministers decided to continue negotiating on that topic with a view to adopting “comprehensive disciplines” within four years of the AFS entering into force. If members do not do so, the AFS may be terminated. This creates an incentive to come to an agreement on OCOF within a certain timeframe. So far 61 members have accepted the AFS. 110 must accept it (two-thirds of the 164 total in the WTO) for it to enter into force.
“The current high level of subsidies by a handful of distant water fishing nations causes environmental problems and creates unfair competition, making it difficult for the Pacific to build its own fleet. A strong OCOF agreement at MC13 to complement this is in the interests of Pacific Island members,” said Minister Maru.
Minister Maru also met with the Fijian Deputy Prime Minister & Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises, and Communications, Manoa Seru Narakasabaria Kamikamica after the briefing and agreed to meet in Suva in the last week of month for bilateral talks.
“The agendas of the discussions will include ratification of the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) Trade Agreement, dual listing of the PNG stocks in the Fiji Stock Exchange and vice versa, investment opportunities for Fiji investors in Special Economic Zones in PNG especially manufacturing companies, investment opportunities for PNG companies in Fiji, training of Papua New Guineans in Fiji in the area of tourism, and non-tariff barriers of PNG export goods to Fiji,” said Minister Maru.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
Maru Heads Delegation to WTO 13th Ministerial Talks,27/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/103,"Minister for International Trade and Investment & the Head of the Papua New Guinea delegation, Richard Maru is in Abu Dhabi participating in the World Trade Organization (WTO) 13th Ministerial Conference (MC13).
Hosted by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the MC13 is being attended by Ministers responsible for trade from the 164 member states of the WTO from February 26- 29, 2024.
“The Ministerial Conferences are the highest decision-making body in the WTO. At MC13 the Trade Ministers will be expected to decide on commitments in the areas of fisheries subsidies, agriculture including food security, trade and development, the moratorium on non-violation complaints relating to intellectual property rights, work program on e-commerce, WTO reform, extension of the WTO’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) waver decision, and the last area pertains to institutional issues and proposals for improving the WTO’s regular work in areas such as transparency, committee operations, small economies, and dispute settlement,” said Minister Maru.
“The negotiation on fisheries subsidies is of particular interest as PNG intends to develop the sector to fully realize its full potential and will require multilateral discipline that safeguards our interests in this regard is imperative,” said Minister Maru.
In the areas of agriculture, development, and e-commerce, Minister Maru said, “As a net importing country, PNG views the discussions on agriculture as very important for food security and policy space and welcomes the new Chair’s Text as the basis for work going forward. While this has been acknowledged as a priority for a majority of WTO members, minimal progress has been made in over 20 years of negotiations to mitigate the pre-existing distortions in the global agricultural market.
He adds, “These distortions persistently undermine the food security of numerous developing country members including PNG. Members must engage constructively in the negotiations to address longstanding divergences and work towards substantive outcomes in agriculture. Such outcomes are imperative to safeguard the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and ensure access to essential foodstuffs for net food-importing developing country members.”
Regarding development, Minister Maru said this agenda is important for developing countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and we are concerned at the lack of progress. Developing countries and LDCs need precise, effective, and operational Special and Differential Treatment (SDT), to better integrate into the multilateral trading system as emphasized in paragraph 44 of the MC4 / Doha Ministerial Declaration and reaffirmed in the MC12 Outcome Document.
“Members must engage in good faith and progress the G-90 proposals beyond MC13. On e-commerce, PNG supports deepened discussions regarding the e-commerce work programme, particularly working towards the development challenges and digital divide faced by many developing countries and LDCs. PNG further supports the extension of the Moratorium on Customs Duties on Electronic Transmission until MC14 to give time to address the implications of applying them, especially for developing members.”
Furthermore, Minister Maru said PNG supports the ongoing work on the WTO Reform to make it more relevant, fair and equitable to the needs of its members given the many challenges faced, such as climate change as well as build the capacities of the developing members to integrate into the multilateral trading system.
Apart from attending and participating in the WTO MC13 in the next few days, Minister Maru will also be having important bilateral meetings on the margins of the conference.
“The outcomes of MC13 will have impact on our national policies as it will set the minimum standard for any other future trade negotiations that PNG enters into. It is therefore important that PNG is well represented at the MC13,” said Minister Maru.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

Socio-Economic Challenges Dampen Business Confidence,13/02/2024,https://tvwan.com.pg/news/41,"In the latest report unveiled by BSP Financial Group, Quarter 4 of 2023 Pacific Economic & Market Insights shed light on the prevailing socio-economic challenges affecting business confidence in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
Throughout the year, escalating law and order issues coupled with service disruptions subdued business confidence, as highlighted by BSP’s Group General Manager for Corporate Banking, Peter Beswick.
The gradual depreciation of the PGK/USD mid-rate since May contributed to the unease within the business community, prompting questions regarding the timing and implications of the currency depreciation in 2023.
However, the outlook began to brighten towards the end of Q4 2023, buoyed by the news of the Porgera mine’s recommission and the signing of the Final Investment Decision (FID) for Papua LNG in 2024, which ignited positive business sentiment.
Nevertheless, Mr. Beswick cautioned against complacency, emphasizing the disruptive events of January 10th, 2024, which severely impacted business sentiment. The incident served as a stark reminder of the escalating law and order challenges faced by PNG, exacerbated by issues such as limited employment opportunities, urban migration, and the soaring cost of living, which have become focal points for unrest.
In light of the impending political uncertainty, with the vote of no confidence becoming permissible in February, Mr. Beswick underscored the imperative for the government to prioritize rebuilding business confidence. He stressed the urgency of delivering on the promised ""Black Wednesday"" relief package to address the concerns of the business community.
Looking ahead, Mr. Beswick highlighted the signing of the Papua LNG FID as pivotal in revitalizing business morale and potentially triggering an extended investment super-cycle for PNG.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation

The issuance of the license marks a pivotal moment, setting the stage for comprehensive pre-feasibility and feasibility exploration activities in the coming years.

The resolution comes after years of concerted efforts to address differences stemming from the ELO1 extension refusal in January 2018. Today's development signifies a milestone in Bougainville's quest for economic self-reliance, with Panguna poised to be a transformative investment, according to Sir Melchior.
The extension aligns with the Bougainville Mining Act 2015, providing BCL with the necessary framework to expand its activities responsibly.
With a strong foundation of community relations established over the years, BCL looks forward to advancing Panguna's redevelopment with mutual respect and collaboration.","Business, Anticipation",Business,Anticipation
