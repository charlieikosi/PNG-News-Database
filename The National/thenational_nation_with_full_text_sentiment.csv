O’Neill claims government took another K1 billion loan,https://www.thenational.com.pg/oneill-claims-government-took-another-k1-billion-loan/,17/11/2025,"IALIBU-Pangia MP Peter O’Neill claims that the Government has taken on another K1 billion in new loans, only weeks after withdrawing more than K1 billion in dividends from Kumul Minerals Holdings Limited. O’Neill, in a statement yesterday, said the latest borrowings include K600 million for the “politically convenient” Connect PNG programme from local banks and K400 million from the Asian Development Bank for general budget support. “That’s K2 billion raised in just a couple of weeks – but still no medicines,” O’Neill said. “The prime minister insensitively told medical workers last Friday to ‘do more with less’, admitting that there is a serious cash shortage and that he cannot release funds to buy essential medicines.” A comment was sought from Prime Minister James Marape yesterday but no response was received when this edition went to press. O’Neill claimed that Marape told doctors and nurses to stop complaining about the lack of funding and to focus on patient outcomes. “Real patriotism is shown when professionals work for the good of the country, not just for pay checks. Health workers must be efficient and resourceful in how they use what is available,” O’Neill said. “Marape’s comments contradict what he said only three weeks earlier when he criticised the 22 governors and provincial health authorities (PHA), claiming that the medicine budget had been spent and that PHAs were at fault for the shortages. “Fast-forward three weeks, and now he is blaming doctors and nurses, while admitting there is no money left to buy medicines. “The public is frustrated by chronic shortages affecting hospitals nationwide and blames Marape and his Pangu Government for the pain, suffering and unnecessary deaths due to the medicine drought. “People want answers on why billions of Kina continue to be committed elsewhere while essential drugs remain out of stock. “It is simply not acceptable for Papua New Guineans to be left without medicines while another K2 billion flows into what many see as a Waigani slush fund.”",Politics,Anger,James Marape,The National
Treasurer: Country needs better return from resources,https://www.thenational.com.pg/treasurer-country-needs-better-return-from-resources/,17/11/2025,"TREASURER Ian Ling- Stuckey says the country needs a better return from its resources. “International studies clearly indicate that Papua New Guinea is benefiting less from its resource wealth than most other developing countries,” he said in a statement. “The Government’s work to get a fairer share is being attacked again by the Opposition. “In a recent statement, he (former prime minister Peter O’Neill) attacked the Government’s work to get payments from the Kumul resource companies.” O’Neill said recently that he had credible information that the Kumul Mineral Holdings had been instructed to pay K1 billion in advanced dividend before the end of the financial year. He said: “Kumul Minerals earns most of its revenues from the Ok Tedi mine. The mine is 100 per cent owned by the people of PNG since 2013 when it was nationalised under my government. We never interfered and the mine ran independently. Now it is being pushed around as the cash-cow. Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) has been instructed to pay K900 million in dividends in 2025.” Ling-Stuckey said that as required by responsible financial management, “the Government is expecting the Kumul Holding companies to pay dividends in line with Government policies”. “The Government, and our international partners, have become more and more concerned about the lack of payments from our Kumuls,” he said. “When the PNGLNG project was being designed, the expectation was that 100 per cent of all the dividends would come to the budget, either directly, or through a Sovereign Wealth Fund.” Ling-Stuckey claimed that O’Neill changed the original approach, and “gave the Kumuls the flexibility to decide how much of the people’s dividends should be paid to the people”. “He was so confused he actually set up a private company but owned by the people of PNG. Worse, it was the only company in the world, where workers decided how much of profits are given back to owners. The people’s budget share was reduced to less than half,” he said. “But even then, the Kumuls have not met this much lower share.  Estimates are that Kumul Petroleum Holdings has K3,299 million in outstanding dividends. “Why then is O’Neill trying to protect Kumul Petroleum from paying their fair share of dividends to help pay for teachers and nurses and police? “The 2025 Budget set out that Kumul Mineral Holdings (KMH) was expected to pay K921 million. Mid-year, only K121 million has been paid. This is unsatisfactory. Any responsible government would go to the Kumuls and instruct them to pay according to the Government’s NEC endorsed dividend policy. “Treasury has not issued demands to Ok Tedi to buy government bills. KMH made an offer to buy extra government bills instead of paying dividends, but this was rejected by Treasury. “Treasury Bills have already been very well supported by investors this year. If KMH has the cash to invest in Treasury Bills, they have the cash to make dividend payments to the Government. We want tax revenues from the resource sector, not just more debt.” Parliament will reconvene tomorrow (Nov 18) for a two-week session dedicated to passing the 2026 National Budget.",Politics,Anger,Nill,The National

Isaac received the award during the Ela Motors SME Awards in Port Moresby last week. The surprise announcement was made after Isaac just finished his performance and had spoken candidly about the importance of building additional pathways for sustainability. “This award is not about me but for all people living with disabilities and doing their hardest to live normal lives to work, to be with our families and make a contribution to our communities,” Isaac said after receiving the award. “Just because someone cannot walk or see or hear does not mean they have nothing to offer society. “My disability does not hold me back as I continue to make music, to appear on stage, run business operations and make my contribution to community development.” Isaac became a paraplegic after a car accident in 2018, and has since transformed adversity into a platform for leadership, inspiration and nation-building. He runs multiple businesses, including the Jokema Inn, Jump Enterprises, Oil Palm Trucking, The Fixers, ZenX Security and the newly-established Spinal Cord Injury Foundation. “God has a path for everyone and I believe that He put me in this wheelchair for a reason. “I went from the highest point in my musical career to the lowest moment of my life when I lost the use of my legs. “But I realised that with focus, discipline and positivity I could rebuild my life. “My purpose now is to look after my people in Morobe, empower young musicians, farmers, SMEs and be an advocate for those living like me.” The award was presented to Jokema after he had taken part in a question and answer session where he discussed how musicians and entrepreneurs should diversify, create and build long term livelihoods. Moments later, Sir Bernard Chan took the stage and presented him with the award, praising his exceptional courage, innovation and unwavering commitment to the community. “To be honoured with this award by such a great and outstanding man of the stature of Sir Bernard Chan is a great honour,” Jokema said.

Yafai appeals conviction,https://www.thenational.com.pg/yafai-appeals-conviction/,17/11/2025,"THE Supreme Court heard an appeal against conviction by former deputy Finance secretary Jacob Yafai and adjourned the case to next month for directions hearing. Yafai, from Yangoru’s Karapia village in East Sepik, was jailed 22 years last month by Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika for misappropriating K41.8 million of State money. He filed this appeal against conviction through his lawyer Edward Sasingian of Sasingian Lawyers. Justice David Cannings, who presided in the matter in a one-man bench in Waigani on Friday, heard the appeal and adjourned it to Dec 11 for further directions. Sasingian informed the court that Yafai’s appeal book was ready but asked the court to give a date in February for the appeal to be heard properly. The court heard that Yafai filed the Supreme Court application without leave to review the decision of Chief Justice Sir Gibbs made on Aug 19, which convicted him on four counts of misappropriation and one count of abuse of office. Yafai argued among other grounds that Sir Gibbs had erred in law and fact when he had him convicted and has sought orders to uphold the appeal, and have the whole of the judgement of Aug 19 quashed. He is also arguing in the appeal that Sir Gibbs had made an error of convicting him on the finding that he was directed by the former Finance secretary the late Steven Gibson to verify the claim by Paul Paraka and that when he had failed to do so, he was acting dishonestly when the evidence before the court said otherwise. On another ground of appeal, Yafai argued that Sir Gibbs erred in mixed facts and law, when he accepted the evidence of the former Finance Minister James Marape that was given against him in court, when it was unreliable and contradicted State exhibit, indicating bias. Yafai further claims that the trial judge erred in law in convicting him on abuse of office, for directing the payment of K41.8 million to Paraka Lawyers when the evidence before the court did not support the element of the charge. He also sought an order to alternatively have the matter remitted back to the National Court for a retrial before another judge.",Business,Anticipation,James Marape,The National

Jail project needs urgent funding,https://www.thenational.com.pg/jail-project-needs-urgent-funding/,17/11/2025,"A CRITICAL restoration of the Mukrumanda jail project in Enga has not started despite a K8 million allocation from the National Government, says an official. Correctional Services Minister Joe Kuli said this funding was to ensure prisons were built to accommodate law offenders from the escalating law and order problems in Enga. “The Correctional Services facilitates the prison areas and allocations for prisons rest with the provincial government. “For a complete rehabilitation of all 21 prisons around the country, it would take K32 million in total, but so far, the allocation to CS has only been at K2 million for prison rehabilitations and other works. “This is insufficient given there are 21 prisons and the functions of each prisons defer,” he said. He said law offenders were being diverted to Baisu Prison in the Western Highlands which had far exceeded its capacity of more than 1,000 persons.

Marape backs Australia to host Cop31,https://www.thenational.com.pg/marape-backs-australia-to-host-cop31/,17/11/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has expressed his strong support for Australia’s bid to host the 31st Conference of the Parties (Cop31) climate summit next year. Marape, in a statement on Thursday, said PNG’s support would elevate the collective voice of the pacific and Oceania region on Global Climate Action. Marape confirmed that he had discussed the matter with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and that Papua New Guinea, alongside other Pacific Island nations, fully supported Australia’s candidature to host the summit. “The Australian bid to host Cop31 is not just an Australian initiative – it is a regional bid, one that carries the full backing of the 15 Pacific Island Forum nations,” Marape said. “We in the Pacific collectively believe that after Brazil hosted Cop30 this year as a forest nation, it is proper and timely for the Oceania region – home of the world’s largest ocean – to host Cop31.” Marape said this proposal represented a continuation of the global conversation linking the “Forest Nations” and “Ocean Nations”, two essential nature-based solutions to climate change. “With due respect to our friends in Turkey, this is nothing personal,” he said. “Turkey and its president are highly respected.” Marape underscored that the Pacific and rainforest nations carry rare moral authority to speak on both mitigation and adaptation, given their vulnerability to the worsening impacts of climate change and their stewardship over vital global carbon sinks. “The Pacific Ocean is the largest on Earth, and our Island Nations are among those most affected by rising sea levels, coastal erosion and changing weather patterns,” he said. “We experience the harshest realities of climate change first hand, yet we also offer some of the most powerful solutions – our forests and our oceans, which absorb massive amounts of carbon and host immense biodiversity.” Marape emphasised that Cop 31 in Australia would not only give voice to the Pacific’s climate concerns but also demonstrate regional solidarity and leadership in driving global transition towards clean, green energy. “The industrialised nations have not yet fully transitioned from fossil fuels to renewable energy,” he said. “As the world works toward this transformation, the Pacific and the rainforest nations – those in the Amazon, the Congo Basin, and here in Southeast Asia – stand as critical partners through our stewardship of forests and oceans.” He added: “From Belém in Brazil to Australia in Oceania, there is a natural sequence – a continuation of the climate dialogue – linking the forest nations and ocean nations. This transition of host venues symbolically connects nature-based solutions to global climate action.”",Politics,Trust,James Marape,The National

Iduhu said: “He wants PNG to have fair access to the Green Climate Fund, which is a large international fund that helps developing countries pay for projects related to climate change. “He (Marape) also wants clear and honest rules for carbon market systems, which is a way for countries to trade ‘carbon credits’ as outlined in the global Paris climate agreement. “This ensures that money from protecting forests goes to the right people. “They must safeguard the rights of landowners with sufficient law enforcement support to ensure they do not come into conflict with illegal loggers. “Most importantly, Marape and his government must ensure police are resourced to protect and serve the people.”",Politics,Anger,"James Marape, Keith Iduhu",The National

Reckless driving still high,https://www.thenational.com.pg/reckless-driving-still-high/,14/11/2025,"MORE THAN 50 road accidents have occurred over the past five months in the National Capital District (NCD). In July, police reported that these accidents were due to high speed and alcohol related, causing deaths of at least 10 people.“With the festive season coming up and while it is a time to be joyful to celebrate the birth of our Lord and saviour, there’s a lot of things that happens during this time,” Police Commissioner David Manning said. Manning urged motorists to take extra precautions and be mindful of pedestrians and other road users. Recent accidents in the city included the Konedobu incident that claimed three lives on Tuesday, one at 5-Mile where a contractor lost his life and two other accidents the same nigh but no deaths. Meanwhile, NCD Metropolitan Superintendent Warrick Simatab said traffic police were investigating the Konedobu accident. “There were about four traffic accidents reported to police because people are still driving recklessly around the city,” he said. “Our traffic officers are making arrests, people are being convicted, but we still have ignorant individuals who do not think about other road users and the people they carry.” Simatab said they were trying their best to ensure some accidents were avoided by conducting random police stop-and-search operations, setting up roadblocks and doing motor patrols to show police presence. When drivers see police, they tend to drive with care. “Police will not always be at locations where you are involved in an accident; look after yourself, passengers and others on the road,” Simatab said. He also called on the relatives of the deceased to work with police to hasten investigations.",Accidents,Sadness,Nill,The National

PM: Economy on solid path,https://www.thenational.com.pg/pm-economy-on-solid-path/,14/11/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape says Papua New Guinea’s economy remains on a solid path, with consistent Budget performance exceeding 90 per cent implementation each year since 2019. On his return from COP30 in Brazil, the Marape outlined the Government’s progress in restoring fiscal discipline, reducing deficits and preparing for a balanced Budget by 2027. “From 2019 to 2024, we have closed our Budgets above 90 per cent — despite global shocks like the Covid-19,” he said. “Our government has been disciplined, transparent and consistent in meeting our economic commitments.” Marape urged citizens, policymakers and commentators to consult the Treasury website, where the final budget outcomes and mid-year economic and fiscal outlook reports are publicly available for scrutiny. “Don’t listen to political noise,” he said. “The facts are there. “Compare every administration from 2010 to now and you will see that this Pangu-led government has delivered strong, honest Budgets.” Marape said PNG was steadily reducing its deficit from a high of nearly nine per cent in 2020 to more sustainable levels. “The target remains to achieve the first balanced budget since 2010 by 2027,” he said. Marape attributed the country’s resilience to reforms in revenue collection, improved project delivery and responsible borrowing for development. “We are managing our economy prudently,” he said. “Our goal is not just growth, but inclusive growth — ensuring every Kina invested brings services to our people, from infrastructure to health and education.” The 2026 Budget will be framed to maintain fiscal discipline while positioning PNG for a fair, credible and well-funded 2027 National Election, with oversight from both Government and Opposition committees to ensure transparency. “Democracy thrives on fairness. “We will fund the 2027 elections properly and allow every political party and citizen to participate freely.” He urged citizens to engage constructively and vote responsibly in 2027: “Vote with purpose. “Choose leaders who can govern, not just talk. “If you want a certain leader as prime minister, then vote for his party’s candidates. “That’s how democracy works.”",Business,Trust,James Marape,The National
ESP students evacuated,https://www.thenational.com.pg/esp-students-evacuated/,14/11/2025,"EAST Sepik Governor Allan Bird says the decision to evacuate the East Sepik students attending the University of Goroka was not political but necessary. Bird said contrary to what many commentators were saying, this was not political for the East Sepik government. “This is about the responsibility of a local government to its people. It would be irresponsible of my government to not act with haste,” he said. “I don’t enjoy wasting scarce public funds. Especially since ESPG has experienced a K104mil funding cut by the national government. ESPG simply does not have any money for any luxurious spending. “But we have to spare funds to move our children safely home.” Bird added that the government had failed to provide security that citizens deserved, and such incident was a reflection of the government’s “incapacity” at all national levels. “I have long lamented our inability as a State to protect our citizens,” he said. “This incident, unfortunately, sadly, is further confirmation. “The situation in Goroka is no different to Wewak. “All services provided by the government are failing in my province as well. We are only surviving by the goodwill of our people. “I hope all the perpetrators at UoG are identified, charged and prosecuted but chances of that are slim to none.” Meanwhile, Bird thanked the Morobe government and Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso for the hospitality provided to students from other centres who are being cared for by Lae secondary schools. He confirmed that a representative from the ESPG was travelling to Lae to coordinate moving the students safely home. “What has happened at UoG is a tragedy and is deeply regrettable,” Bird reiterated. “As a provincial government, we are only responding to requests from our students and their parents who are rightly concerned about the safety of their children. “Forty-five students were injured during a fight that lasted many hours. “We were extremely lucky there were not more casualties. “While this may well be an isolated incident, there is little doubt that serious tensions existed long before this incident erupted. “Until then, the primary responsibility of the ESPG is to remove as many of our constituents as possible out of harm’s way.”",Politics,Fear,"Allan Bird, John Rosso",The National
"Community should be supportive of university, says VC",https://www.thenational.com.pg/community-should-be-supportive-of-university-says-vc/,14/11/2025,"THE University of Goroka (UoG) has spent close to K40 million each year for goods and services in Eastern Highlands, Vice-Chancellor Dr Teng Waninga says. He said with that amount going into the economy of Goroka as spinoff, the community should be supportive of the university as the premier teacher training institution in the country. Waninga, early this week was emotional about the way neighbouring community attacked the university and the students on Sunday in a fight that was reported to have lasted for eight hours. He said for rentals alone, the non-residential students pay between K80 and K200, depending on the quality of the building, and the distance from the rental accommodation to the university. For the residential students, the university pays in excess of K5,000 per fortnight to rental accommodation owners, he said. Since 2022, when a major earthquake destabilised the foundation of the dormitory structures, some students have been forced to seek alternative accommodation in communities. He said for the surrounding communities to receive direct benefits from the university, they can be smart enough to re-invest that money in sustainable livelihood activities. “For 20 years, I have paid that much – K37 million in goods and services,” he said. “Yet, the community cannot understand that and caused disturbances to the campus.” Waninga said the Government also funded K200 million for the construction of the five-storey central administration and student forum building, which will be opened by the end of the year. He said another K20 million for two new dormitories to be constructed soon to cater for student accommodation. “This is what the university can offer to Eastern Highlands as the host province of the premier learning institution,” he added. The recent fight was rooted to locals drinking beer on Saturday night, and demanding money from a student, he added. Former Eastern Highlands Governor Peter Mumu on social media expressed his dissatisfaction on the conduct of the people of Okiufa and Asaroufa towards the university.

"Establishing an assembly is way forward, says Masatt",https://www.thenational.com.pg/establishing-an-assembly-is-way-forward-says-masatt/,14/11/2025,"THE establishment of the Bougainville Constituent Assembly (BCA) paves the path toward managing the final constitution-making process that leads to independence, Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) Attorney-General Ezikiel Masatt says. The Bca comprises 45 elected members of the House of Representatives and Speaker (Simon Pentanu) who serves as chairman, including appointed members representing the Bougainville Constitutional Planning Commission. Masatt said the BCA, which had its members sworn-in this week, was the mandated body to steer the final stages of Bougainville’s constitution-making process. “The role of the Bca is to manage the final stages of the constitutional making process, leading to independence. The fundamental duty of the Bca is to discuss, debate the draft independent constitution and adopt the independence constitution,” he said. “Because the constitution came directly from the people. “I urge the Bca members to seek a careful balance. “While the Bca has the legal right to amend or reject the draft, members must avoid making ‘wholesale changes’ to the constitution. Masatt reminded members that the assembly carries the sole constitutional authority to set Bougainville’s official independence date once the constitution is adopted. “The responsibility for setting the independence date rests solely with the (Bca) and nobody else,” he said. “While the Leaders Consultative Forum has recommended Sept 1, 2027, this date must be reviewed and decided upon by the members sitting in the assembly today.” Masatt reiterated the three pathways to achieving independence, one of which was through the constitution-making process itself. He said the preferred pathway to independence remains grounded in the Bougainville Peace Agreement, reflecting on Bougainville’s fulfilment of its obligations under the Bpa, from weapons disposal to the withdrawal of security forces, leading to the constitutional guarantee that enabled the 2019 referendum.",Politics,Anticipation,Nill,The National

He also emphasised the role of schools and teachers in promoting responsible digital use for students. “Technology is here to stay, we have to embrace it and we have to work with it so we are not left behind,” he said. “I believe that with the schools taking charge of using technology they can also put some ethics into the use of technology at school-aged children, especially with the use of social media today.” Wilson also commended MP Peter Tsiamalili Jr for his leadership and ongoing commitment to improving education in Bougainville.

In the past four years, there had been no salary upgrades, no CPI, no appraisal payments.” He said that workers had been told by Water PNG that they might not be paid on Pay 26 “because our financial position is bad”. “Water PNG’s source of income is the water bills and they have to pay up,” he said.

A friend and benefactor of Papua New Guinea,https://www.thenational.com.pg/a-friend-and-benefactor-of-papua-new-guinea/,13/11/2025,"WE atThe Nationalare saddened by the loss of our founder, Tan Sri Sir Tiong Hiew King. A dedicated friend of Papua New Guinea over a long time, Tan Sri Sir Tiong passed away at 11 am on Tuesday at his home in Sibu, Malaysia. Although in his later life, Forbes would quote him as one of the richest persons in Asia with businesses in China, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Russia, South America and parts of Africa, Tan Sri Sir Tiong was born in a far humbler setting in Fujian province, China on March 18, 1934, the eldest of nine siblings. He left school at the tender age of 13 to work and support his family. He later completed his secondary school and his university education via correspondence studies. This humble beginning and close relationship to his family was to determine all his dealings in his adult years and his philanthropic interests. He was physically imposing but humble and soft spoken. The story of Rimbunan Hijau (RH) started in Sibu in 1975, the year of PNG’s independence, when he and his brothers co-founded the company. The company gradually expanded from hardware and construction materials into timber, oil palm plantations, hotels, retail, information technology and finance. In PNG, Rimbunan Hijau has interests in oil palm, tree plantations, timber, aviation, the Vision City mega mall, the RH Hypermart and other RH retail chains, and the Pacific Star which publishesThe National. The Rimbunan Hijau Group and Papua New Guinea this year celebrated their 50-year anniversary. The founding ofThe Nationalbegan in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, around June 1993. On a State visit to Malaysia, then Prime Minister Paias Wingti requested the company of Datuk (as he was then) Tiong at the PNG High Commission and asked him to consider starting a television company for Papua New Guinea. To this request, Tan Sri Sir Tiong respectfully declined, but offered instead an alternative which was the possibility of starting a newspaper. He said he had expertise in newspapers and was already publishing Sin Chew Jit Poh and a number of other titles in Malaysia. Wingti agreed to this suggestion, and they shook hands on it. True to his word, eight weeks later, Tan Sri Sir Tiong sent an envoy to Port Moresby with instructions to start a newspaper. A few months later, on Nov 11, 1993, in the company of Prime Minister Wingti and Tan Sri Tiong, the late Communication Minister Martin Thompson pressed the button to start the press for the first issue ofThe National. The Nationaljust turned 32 on Tuesday this week, November 11, the day the man responsible for its existence, passed on. Tan Sri Sir Tiong Hiew King had made a tremendous and positive impact in PNG. Total investment in PNG is worth at least K1.8 billion, and the RH Group of companies employ more than 9,500 Papua New Guineans. Many Papua New Guinean families have benefited directly or indirectly from the company. That is substantial and is a legacy for Tan Sri Sir Tiong. In June 2009, Queen Elizabeth conferred on him the Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in recognition of his contributions to Papua New Guinea.

"PNG, Australia officials commemorate Armistice Day",https://www.thenational.com.pg/png-australia-officials-commemorate-armistice-day/,13/11/2025,"AN Armistice Day commemoration ceremony was held at the Bomana War Cemetery in Port Moresby on Tuesday. Armistice Day, also known as Remembrance Day, commemorates the end of the Great War (World War I), the signing of the Armistice. The ceremony included a minute’s silence at 11am, marking the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, the moment when guns fell silent across the Western Front and the war ended. Armistice Day pays respect to those who lost their lives in all wars and conflicts. In his Armistice address, Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea and Special Envoy to the Pacific Ewen McDonald spoke of the significance of Papua New Guinea in WWI to Australian soldiers. He said “perhaps the most familiar names linking war and Papua New Guinea to Australians are the Kokoda Trail and the Coral Sea from the Second World War. However, New Guinea was the site of the first Australian battles and deaths in the Great War.” Papua New Guinea was the site of Australia’s first successful combat action in WWI, resulting in the taking of an enemy occupied radio station in Rabaul, East New Britain. Visiting Australian Defence Force chaplain Lt-Col Michael Folland recited ‘In Flanders fields’, a poem which speaks of the red poppies, the first plants that sprouted from the devastation of the battlefields of northern France and Belgium. The Flanders poppy has become the flower of remembrance worn on Armistice Day. The commemoration ceremony was attended by PNGDF chief Rear Admiral Philip Polewara, visiting Commander of the 1st (Australian) Division, Major General Ashley Collingburn, Australian Defence Adviser Colonel Nicholas Trotter and several diplomatic and Defence representatives from both countries.",Commemoration,Trust,Nill,The National
Yama’s election petition against Kumara set for hearing next year,https://www.thenational.com.pg/yamas-election-petition-against-kumara-set-for-hearing-next-year/,13/11/2025,"A COURT will proceed to hear an election petition by businessman and former Madang governor Peter Yama (pictured) against Usino Bundi MP Vincent Kumara and the electoral commission (EC). National Court Judge Joseph Yagi, who presided over the matter on Tuesday in Waigani, issued directions that the matter would progress. Judge Yagi fixed Feb 4, 2026, for pre-trial conference, and ordered EC to file affidavits before the matter returned because they were not present in court. Yama filed the election petition on the grounds that there were errors and omissions and illegal practice against EC leading to mass voting which affected the result of the election. Yama argued that EC and its officers had failed in their statutory duty to provide election materials, resulting in the denial of voting rights for 1,700 voters, far exceeding the margin of victory. He alleged another ground – that there were illegal practices conducted by Kumara and his supporters in hijacking one ballot box and stuffing it away which had affected the result of the election. Yama alleged that the scrutiny process failed to meet the statutory requirements for openness and transparency, and unlawfully obstructed the oversight duties of scrutineers, comprising the reliability of the court. He is seeking relief to have the petition upheld by the court pursuant to section 212(1) (i) of the Organic Law, and an order for the Usino Bundi Gama open electorate in this year’s by-election be declared void. He is asking the court to order a by-election for the electorate and for the refund of K5,000 which was paid into the National Court Registry’s Trust Account as security deposit.

Governor Rapa supports call for nationwide liquor ban,https://www.thenational.com.pg/governor-rapa-supports-call-for-nationwide-liquor-ban/,13/11/2025,"WESTERN Highlands Governor Wai Rapa has strongly supported earlier calls by many leaders for a total liquor ban in the country. Wai Rapa made the call in light of the recent fight between students of the University of Goroka (UOG) and locals from Ato community in Goroka last Sunday. The fight led to the insecurity of students that forced the university council to suspend the remainder of the 2025 academic year for continuing students while the final year students would remain on campus to complete the year. Rapa said the fight was started by drunk locals from Ato market, a community adjacent to the university, who confronted and assaulted a student from Western Highlands on Saturday night. He said the number one public enemy in the country was alcohol. He said this when addressing almost 1000 students who were evacuated to Mt Hagen from Goroka on Tuesday evening. He said this would not have happened if the locals were not drunk. He said alcohol was the main cause of the fight that started on Saturday night. “Liquor is destroying this country. It would be good if the Government could consider regulating or completely banning liquor. Start with the Highlands region,” he said. Rapa said he had already raised the issue in Parliament. “Papua New Guineans are not fit to drink beer,” said. The same call was made by Minister for Higher Education, Research and Science and Technology, Kinoka Feo on Monday. Feo said alcohol was identified as the chief cause of the fight and called on Eastern Highlands Governor, Simon Sia, to look into the issue. He said Eastern Highlands’ economy can survive without beer. Vice Chancellor Dr Tiang Waninga said every fortnight, when the Ato community received their accommodation rentals from the university, they spent the money on beer. “Alcohol overshadowed the security and progress of people and communities,” Dr Waninga said. Meanwhile, close to 1,000 Western Highlands students studying at UOG arrived in Mt Hagen at six pm on Tuesday to an emotional reception. A few of the students were from Jiwaka, Hela, Enga, Southern Highlands, with a number of them from the coastal regions who live in Mt Hagen. In a convoy of 40 vehicles including buses, led by the police commander, Chief Supt John Sagom, and tertiary students’ tuition subsidy coordinator, Elton Kewa, the convoy ended up at the Queens Park, to be greeted by Governor Rapa, provincial leaders, parents and the communities from the four districts. Students wept openly when they reached Jiwaka and Western Highlands border at Tuman, about three kilometers away from Mt Hagen. People braved the evening showers and chill to stand at the roadside to cheer them on while mothers beat their chest and cried. Wai Rapa greeted the students and embraced their leaders, and welcomed their safe return. Student leader, Jason Goimba, said they were all emotional.",Politics,Sadness,Wai Rapa,The National
Marape: Respect education and tertiary institutions,https://www.thenational.com.pg/marape-respect-education-and-tertiary-institutions/,13/11/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has appealed for discipline, responsibility, and respect for education in the nation’s tertiary institutions, following recent incidents of student unrest and alcohol-related disturbances at several campuses. Speaking at Jackson International Airport upon his return from Brazil on Tuesday, the Prime Minister expressed regret over disruptions at the University of Goroka and Sonoma Adventist College, saying the behaviour of a few should not compromise the future of many. “I apologise to the innocent students, parents, and sponsors affected by these incidents,” Marape said. “Our Universities are places for learning and leadership — not disorder.” He confirmed that the Government is investing more than K100 million in infrastructure at the University of Goroka, with plans to fence and secure the campus in next year’s budget to enhance safety and discipline. Marape also directed Higher Education Minister Kinoka Feo to explore a “no alcohol policy” for students in all tertiary institutions across the country. “Students must focus on their studies. There is time for social life after graduation,” he said. “We want our universities to produce disciplined, ethical graduates who can lead our nation.” Marape appealed to local communities surrounding universities to cooperate with authorities in maintaining peace and security. “The University of Goroka has been a pillar of education for over 50 years,” he said. “I call on local tribes and residents to continue supporting the institution and its students. The local community around the university was very hospitable in the past for so long. Lately it is being noted that there are settlements growing around the north Goroka area. I call on those who have settled into Goroka to live like the way Eastern Highlanders or Goroka people do.” He said that the government would work with the university council to strengthen student welfare, safety, and discipline, including online learning alternatives where necessary to ensure continuity of study. “We are proud of our education system and will protect it,” Marape said. “Education is the key to nation- building, and our youth must take this privilege seriously. “Papua New Guinea’s future depends on the character of its young people.”",Education,Concern,James Marape,The National

Secretary Philip Leo said the weeklong consultation ended last Tuesday after the views of the people were gathered as they prepare for representation in Parliament after the 2027 General Election. He said there had not been any consultations conducted before the announcement of the new electorate to be created which resulted in confusion among the people. “The consultation has made it evident that we need to seek guidance on boundary demarcation from the Electoral Boundaries Commission (EBC),” he said. “Even the existing report lacks clarity.” The EBC’s 2021 report recommended that Parliament approve the creation of 13 new open electorates in the country. In 2022, only seven (Delta Fly, Hiri-Koiari, Margarima, Nakanai, Popondetta, Porgera-Paiela and Wau-Waria) could participate in the elections that year. The remaining six including Motu-Koita in the National Capital District, Baniara in Milne Bay, Baining in East New Britain, Middle Sepik in East Sepik, Mendi Central in Southern Highlands and Anglimp in Jiwaka, are being prepared for the 2027 elections. Leo thanked the Motu-Koita people for their participation during the consultations as it would help in their efforts to address administrative challenges. “The feedback collected will be compiled into a report for the minister to be presented to the NEC,” he said. “The report will also outline administrative challenges and propose strategies on how the Motu-Koita Assembly can collaborate with the NCD Commission to establish the electorate.” Motu-Koita’s 14 wards: Korobosea, Mahuru, Kirakira, Vabukori, Pari Taota, Pari Taurama, Baruni, Tatana, Araira, Elevala Mirigini, Elevala Lahara, Elevala Laurabada, Poreporena Lahara, Poreporena Laurabada.",Politics,Anticipation,Nill,The National

Manning said they are considering similar additions to like Kokopo, Lae and Mt Hagen. “When we were cracking down on some of the offences, we would need larger capacity jails to keep those alleged offenders in the cell,” he said. “And then we will roll that out in the next couple of years. The second project is having a national referral Family Sexual Violence Unit (FVSU) station to take care of victims.” Manning said they are looking at one of the locations in the city to build that station under the Special Policing Assistance Programme (SPAP) that would house FSVU victims. Manning said that they would be working with their partners to provide rehabilitation services, whether it’s psychological or physical support, and medical services. He said the two projects were expected to be completed by the end of next year, building a conducive environment for women and young girls. “In the next parliament sitting, the Police Minister will be informing parliament as to what we’ve done since the SPAP started and we’ve done some great work in the country,”he said.

The Ialibu-Pangia MP said that the Government led by Prime Minister James Marape had failed the 6,000 University of Goroka students, their families and the people of Goroka. “We all remember how Marape reacted in July 2019, (when) 16 women and children, were hacked and shot to death in his own district. “At the time, Marape made a vow to track down the perpetrators who he called ‘gun-toting criminals and warlords’. “Six years later, no one has been brought to justice. “Prime Minister Marape did not track down their killers and instead presided over a government that has seen violence rip our country apart. “Fast forward to 2025 – and the senate of the University of Goroka have taken the extraordinary step to restore safety by suspending class and curtailing the academic year impacting around 6,000 students. “I do not blame the senate for the decision, but I do blame Marape, his Cabinet and security forces for not providing the support to prevent the incident occurring, and to give the comfort the senate needed so that normalcy could be returned to the university, its students and teachers. “Rather than shut down UOG, teachers and students should be provided with appropriate security to ensure safety while investigations and mediations go on and allow the academic year to be completed. “Perhaps the right move is to stop spending millions of our people’s money globetrotting and instead stay home and lead from the front and fix the mess you have created. “The whole country is begging the prime minister to stop talking and travelling and start working and delivering.”",Politics,Anger,James Marape,The National

Yaom Sani – the little girl freed from her ‘heavy burden’,https://www.thenational.com.pg/yaom-sani-the-little-girl-freed-from-her-heavy-burden/,12/11/2025,"TWO years ago, the story of little Yaom Sani from Hotte village in the Salamaua, Morobe touched hearts across Papua New Guinea. Then, just five years old, Yaom carried what doctors described as a “heavy burden”. She had large swellings in her neck and shoulder area that limited her movement and kept her from playing like other children. Today, aged seven, Yaom has fully recovered and eager to return to school next year. Her father Sani Matayam said the transformation in his daughter has brought hope and joy not only to their family but to the entire community. “She can now run around and play with the other children,” he said. “For a long time, we were worried about her health, but now she is strong and wants to go to school.” The turning point came when Yaom was flown out of her village and underwent a demanding operation at Mt Hagen General Hospital under a specialist team led by Chief Surgeon Dr Benjamin Yapo. Dr Yapo reported that Yaom was diagnosed with a condition known as cystic hygroma, which is part of a group of vascular anomalies located deep in her neck and armpit. Because the growth spanned from her right neck across to her chest wall, the eight-hour surgery was described as extremely difficult. According to reports by this paper on November 22nd, 2023, Dr Yapo said: “Surgery went so well that I surprised myself that I was able to dissect far enough on both ends to remove the complete mass without leaving any part behind.” Yaom and her family have extended heartfelt thanks to everyone who helped: Dr Yapo and the surgical team, the late Luther Wenge (former Governor of Morobe), John Rosso (Deputy Prime Minister and Lae MP), the Manalos medivac team and generous individuals who rallied behind her. The support covered the complex operation and travelling logistics. With her physical health restored, Yaom’s dreams are now set on her future. Speaking to this paper, she said she wants to become a doctor when she grows up. “I want to help sick people,” she said. “I want to be able to help other children like me in the future.” For the Sani family, Yaom’s new dream is based on experience that they went through and will be one of the stories that is emotionally tied to one of the good deeds of the late Wenge.",Health,Joy,"John Rosso, Luther Wenge",The National

Barker called for an extensive review of the recently released population data which puts the total number of people in the country at 10,185,363. “The administration of the 2024 census seemed somewhat shambolic from the start, with real governance concerns raised as well,” he said. “From various min-sample surveys around the country and ad hoc feedback online, it appears that a substantial portion of the population was never censured, even in the National Capital District where the population was relatively accessible.

Bougainville must exercise power: Masatt,https://www.thenational.com.pg/bougainville-must-exercise-power-masatt/,12/11/2025,"BOUGAINVILLE’s political freedom must take precedence over economic readiness in its pursuit for independence, Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) Attorney-General Ezikiel Masatt says. At the Bougainville House of Representatives sitting last month, Masatt said that international law did not require economic strength as a condition for sovereignty but rather recognised independence based on population size, defined borders, and a law-making authority. “Political power must come first if we are to make strategic economic decisions,” he said. “Take for example, the fishing sector; 30 per cent of the annual one billion Kina industry’s catches occur in Bougainville waters, yet the region receives only K5 million annually from the National Fisheries Authority.” He stressed that Bougainville must exercise its own sovereign powers to redirect economic benefits toward its people and build long-term self-reliance. “We must exercise symbolic sovereign powers in order to make many of these economic strategic decisions,” he said. Masatt also rejected the argument that the presence of weapons remained an obstacle to independence, noting that the Bougainville Peace Agreement’s constitutional provisions under Part 14 were achieved following a verified and phased weapons disposal programme. He added that since the restoration and establishment of the Autonomous Bougainville Government in 2005, Bougainville elections had been conducted peacefully and without gun-related disruptions, unlike incidents often observed during election periods in other parts of PNG.

In the second exclusion of counting, candidate Elisah Wesley secured 2,179 votes, surpassing the absolute majority of 2,078 voters required – 50 per cent of formal votes plus one. His lead earned him an unofficial declaration as the winner by Toma LLG assistant returning officer Irenius Tiula at midday on last Thursday. During this decisive round, other two candidates remained in the race, including the former president of the once amalgamated Toma-Vunadidir LLG. “Counting for the LLG president seat began on last Monday and last Thursday, we elected a new president. The candidate that led after the completion of primary counting yesterday, maintained his dominance to win,” Tiula said. Wesley emerged victorious from a field of five candidates who initially contested the presidency. Sadly, one candidate passed away just a week before polling started. After updating the results board with the final figures, Tiula stated that the results would be announced onNational Broadcasting Corporation(NBC) ENB, by the provincial returning officer from Electoral Commission in Kokopo, along with declarations for other LLG presidents in ENB. Tiula further explained that following the administrative separation of Tomas and Vunadidir LLGs last year, the Toma LLG structure had been re-established in preparation for this year’s elections to select a political head. “The new president was voted by the majority of the people of Toma and so I believed there will be good things coming and also collaboration between the political head and the LLG administration,” he said. With an elected president now in office, Tiula expressed optimism that the people across Toma LLG’s 18 wards would soon begin to see improved services and development.

Cosmas Borewa, a supervisor from the Pha overseeing the vaccination programme in the district, said there had been a positive response from families in the local communities. Borewa said the only issue with the roll out of the programme was the lack of network connectivity due to the remoteness of the location. “We have received positive response from the local communities,” he said. “The health workers in the district are helping to roll out the supplementary immunisation activities which have improved the coverage in most of the areas near the health facilities. “Our biggest challenge is the network coverage which we need to send data collected from the programme. “Despite this issue, we are focused on completing all our activities by this week.” Borewa thanked the Australian Doctors International (ADI) which provided much of the logistical support for their work in the district. “We are glad to have ADI working with us on the ground,” he said. “We planned to complete this vaccination programme in two weeks and their support has been very helpful to us.” ADI coordinator Joyce Seneba said the logistical support was necessary given the remoteness of the people living in Kandrian-Gloucester. “Some of the teams had to travel by boats we had to hire,” she said. “We also had to pay allowances for workers who are working here.” Turuk Catholic health centre officer Steven Kadiko thanked the Pha and Adi for their support to provide such an important service. “We have been facing many problems with vaccinating children below the age of 10 but with this support we have now, we are confident of reaching out target,” he said. “There are more than 1,000 children here that need to be vaccinated so we plan to complete the exercise by this week. “We encourage more parents to bring their children to be vaccinated.”",Health,Trust,Nill,The National

All 20 Turkish troops killed in Georgia plane crash,https://www.thenational.com.pg/all-20-turkish-troops-killed-in-georgia-plane-crash/,12/11/2025,"Ankara: Turkey’s defence ministry says 20 soldiers were killed in the crash of its military aircraft in Georgia a day earlier, as inspectors continued to seek clues what caused the Nato member’s cargo plane to go down. The C-130 plane took off from Azerbaijan for Turkey and crashed in Georgia on Tuesday. Ankara has not yet provided a reason for its deadliest military incident since 2020. It said Turkish and Georgian authorities began inspections at the site, in the Sighnaghu municipality of Georgia’s Kakheti district, on Wednesday morning. Initial footage from the scene showed chunks of twisted metal strewn across a grassy knoll, while unverified footage on social media showed the plane breaking apart in mid-air and then corckscrewing towards the earth in a blaze. On Wednesday, the Turkish Defence Ministry released a list of the 20 soldiers killed in the crash. The leaders of Azerbaijan and Georgia, as well as the Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, have all conveyed condolences. Tom Barrack, the US Ambassador to Turkey, has also expressed his country’s solidarity with Turkey after the crash. Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler on Tuesday spoke to his Georgian and Azerbaijani counterparts, as well as Azerbaijan’s chief of staff, to discuss search and rescue operations. US firm Lockheed Martin, which makes the C-130 Hercules that is widely used by air forces around the world, expressed its condolences and said it was committed to helping Turkey in any way during the investigation. The C-130 Hercules is a cargo, troop and equipment carrier aircraft. It is described as a four-engine, turboprop military transport aircraft that can make use of unprepared runways for takeoffs and landings. Its versatile airframe has enabled it to be used for other purposes as well, including as a gunship and for airborne assault and reconnaissance operations. It is now viewed as one of the main tactical airlifters for many militaries. Source: Reuters",Military,Sadness,Nill,The National
"Forests, finance, fossils: Climate talks hit full steam",https://www.thenational.com.pg/forests-finance-fossils-climate-talks-hit-full-steam/,12/11/2025,"Canberra: Tens of thousands of delegates have descended on a small town in Brazil for annual climate change talks, where adaptation, forests, finance and fossil fuels are set to dominate. Formal negotiations will kick off on Monday following a meeting of heads of state last week in Belem, the gateway to the Amazon rainforest. Australian Climate and Energy Minister Chris Bowen is due to attend the two-week Conference of the Parties summit, where last-minute lobbying for the rights to host the next round of United Nations climate talks will be a priority. The Australia-Pacific co-bid has stalled as a competing bid from Turkey remains in play, with no location set and just 12 months to prepare. Australia has been gunning to host the 2026 conference to attract international investment in clean industries and strengthen its relationship with strategically important Pacific neighbours. The annual talks take place at a strained time for global co-operation on responding to the challenges of temperature rise. The US government has been actively pulling back and so far, Europe has not stepped in to fill the void as assertively as it has during other periods of faltering climate ambition. And while pollution-slashing promises have the world tracking towards less warming than the troubling trajectory that first spurred Paris into existence a decade ago, the pact’s stated goals of keeping temperature rise below 2C, ideally 1.5C, are still off track. The gap between emission reduction commitments and temperature limits is expected to dominate the event, as well as discussions on adaptation, climate finance and phasing down fossil fuels. Carbon-absorbing forests will also be given prominence thanks to the symbolic location in the Amazon rainforests, known as the “lungs of the world”.

"No rules, no use: Aussie firms may miss AI opportunity",https://www.thenational.com.pg/no-rules-no-use-aussie-firms-may-miss-ai-opportunity/,12/11/2025,"Brisbane: A lack of rules governing artificial intelligence technology is holding Australian businesses back, a report has found, and could result in them squandering a AU$142 billion (about K397b) opportunity. Networking firm Cisco and the Governance Institute of Australia issued the warning on Tuesday after conducting research across multiple firms, including banks, charities, education and retail groups. More Australian organisations were adopting the technology in 2025, the study found, although the nation still lagged behind others in the Asia Pacific region. The findings come after the federal government pledged to release a national AI plan before the end of the year, and following an update to Australia’s Voluntary AI Safety Standard. The report, called Turning Hesitation Into Action, analysed Cisco’s AI Readiness Index and the institute’s AI Deployment and Governance Survey, in addition to holding discussions with representatives from the finance, education, non-profit and retail sectors. It found Australian organisations were slow to adopt AI tools, with just 22 per cent expressing full confidence in the technology, up from four per cent in 2024. Almost two in three organisations did not offer AI training to staff (64 per cent) and most could not effectively measure the return on their AI investments (93 per cent). Many Australian businesses lacked the necessary expertise or guidelines to invest in AI innovation with confidence, Cisco Australia and New Zealand chief technology officer Carl Solder said, despite OpenAI’s estimate it could deliver a $142 billion dividend by 2030.

In an address to the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday, Suzuki Kazuhiro will call for the partnership between Tokyo, Washington, and Canberra to be stepped up. He will also advocate for the Quad, a four-nation diplomatic framework which includes India to be strengthened. “A stronger Japanese presence in Australia not only enhances Australia’s deterrence, but also reinforces Japan’s strategic resilience, thereby strengthening our joint deterrence,” he will say. “Japan and Australia standardise their equipment and develop systems for mutual logistical support, we will greatly enhance our collective resilience.” Relations between Washington and New Delhi hit a low point after the Trump administration imposed punitive tariffs of 50 per cent on Indian goods, including a 25 per cent penalty for its refusal to stop buying Russian oil as the war in Ukraine draws out. Suzuki said both nations must “advance defence industrial co-operation”. “When all is said and done, our relationship has endured because — just as ‘no man is an island’ — no nation can remain alone and adrift on the tides of change,” he will say. “In today’s more serious and complex environment, our cooperation will become even more indispensable to maintaining the peace and prosperity of the region and realising a free and open Indo-Pacific. “Bound by trust, we must continue to steer together.” Source: AAP",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National

Higher Education, Research and Science Minister Kinoka Feo said: “We can either send students home and get continuing students to come back early 2026 to do exams, given the trauma experienced, or get police on site in the university, relocate students to guests houses and other colleges and where there is accommodation over two to three days to conduct examinations before they can go back home.” He said that the National Executive Council would release K10 million to build dormitories to accommodate students in 2026, and for fencing. The Works and Highways Department has been tasked to build the dormitories given the urgency of the situation. Nearly half of the students residing off campus rent nearby rooms and homes and travel daily to classes. “We are progressing on it so students don’t have to live within the town and communities,” he said.

No change in budget deficit forecast: Treasurer,https://www.thenational.com.pg/no-change-in-budget-deficit-forecast-treasurer/,11/11/2025,"TREASURER Ian Ling-Stuckey says the 2025 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) indicates no change in the 2025 Budget Deficit of K2,949 million. He said this yesterday while brushing aside a recent statement by former prime minister Peter O’Neill accusing the Government of raiding public companies for nearly K2 billion to resupply its depleted accounts. O’Neill had said: “Revenue is down K1.6 billion and spending is up K500 million resulting in a nearly K2 billion budget hole after the first half of this year.” Ling- Stuckey said: “The 2025 MYEFO does not require an increase in public debt, as it keeps within the original budget deficit. “The 2025 MYEFO shows revenues down by K1,183 million, or 4.7 per cent.  The challenges this presents were highlighted in the MYEFO. Policy adjustments are required, just as they were in 2015. “The 2025 MYEFO shows budget implementation of 42 per cent. Expenditure by the end of June was K11,900 million.  Budget expenditure was 121 per cent higher than in 2015. PSIP at 60 per cent. DSIP at 60 per cent. “The 2025 MYEFO also uses better estimating methodologies for changed expenditures. Specifically, it estimated that 2025 expenditures would be K494 million higher than budgeted. “This extra K494 million is attacked as irresponsible by O’Neill – claims of just “Resupply the Waigani Slush Fund”.  But what is he hiding? “Why doesn’t he mention that K220 million of the expected expenditure increase is due to more salary payments required for our teachers?  Does he want to sack teachers at our children’s schools?  Isn’t it better to make provision for the extra teachers, to ensure that they can continue to be paid on time?  Making provision for this extra cost is good budget management. “The second part of the increased expenditure is an increase in donor grant funding support of K274 million. Why does he oppose our international friends providing grant support for our development? “This extra donor support counts as both extra revenue and expenditure, so it has no impact on the deficit. “The attack on this increased allowance for expenditure is clearly sensationalist and irresponsible. We want to pay our teachers, and we kindly accept over half of this expenditure increase, which is 100 per cent grant support from our international friends.

Sir Peter, who made his way up the ranks from a council president after 18 years, said it was a worrying to see the trend of candidates contesting the LLG elections because of money. “In our time, we served the people as volunteers who were paid small allowances,” he said. “We mainly took the job as a form of service to our community. “Most of us were paid only K6 per quarter. But now we can see that everyone wants to become a councillor because they will be on payroll after they are elected. “This is not the right thing to be doing, especially for leaders at the sub-national level who are meant to live with the people and solve issues on the ground.” Sir Peter said this year’s LLG elections were a cause for concern, especially seeing the behaviour of candidates having changed compared with how things were in the past. “There is no point in holding big campaign rallies when the people who you are trying to serve live with you,” he said. “This shows that the systems meant to govern are failing us.” Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs Minister Soroi Eoe had announced earlier this year that elected leaders would be paid fortnightly. He said this was part of the government’s efforts to improve the country’s third tier of government by empowering LLG leaders. “The government has made some significant and important improvements in the LLGs since 1995 such as putting ward councillors and (LLG) presidents in the governments’ payroll system to receive fortnight salaries of K300.

Marape: Our forest is our contribution to humanity,https://www.thenational.com.pg/marape-our-forest-is-our-contribution-to-humanity/,11/11/2025,"PAPUA New Guinea offers 35 million hectares of rainforest as its contribution to fighting climate change as Prime Minister James Marape call on world leaders to honour their commitments. “Act now and act responsibly to save the planet,” Marape told a COP30 World Leaders Climate Summit in Belem, Brazil yesterday. Marape urged nations to honour their commitments under the Paris Agreement and embrace nature-based solutions as the foundation for global climate action. He said for PNG climate adaptation and mitigation was not a choice but a matter of survival. “Forests and oceans offer nature-based solutions and technologies to replenish Mother Earth,” he said. “PNG safeguards 35 million hectares of pristine rainforest – the lungs of the earth – and we offer this as our contribution and legacy to humanity. “This shows that even a small forest nation like PNG can drive global impact. “Our intention is to ratify the protection of 30 per cent of our ocean area from illegal and commercial exploitation. “With seven per cent of the world’s biodiversity in our land and waters, the sustainable use of our oceans and forests is vital to saving this planet.” Marape acknowledged global partners including the United Nations, the Green Climate Fund, France, Australia, the Coalition for Rainforest Nations and the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) for supporting PNG’s conservation efforts. “Without saving our forests, trees and oceans, the climate change conversation is redundant,” Marape said. “Technology is important, but without nature-based solutions, it cannot succeed. “You can look at 46 billion light years into the universe, and you will not find another planet like ours. “This planet is worth fighting for. Let us pass on a liveable earth to our children as our ancestors did for us,” he said. Marape pledged PNG’s support for Australia’s bid to co-host COP31, which he said, would “bridge the conversation between forestry and ocean nations, uniting both fronts to keep our earth in balance.”",Environment,Anticipation,James Marape,The National
"Funding support needed for forest nations, PM says",https://www.thenational.com.pg/funding-support-needed-for-forest-nations-pm-says/,11/11/2025,"A STRONGER global financing mechanism should be in place to support forest and ocean nations, Prime Minister James Marape said during the COP30 Climate Summit in Belem, Brazil. He stressed that tropical countries like PNG, Brazil and Congo were “carrying the weight of the planet’s survival” in their fight to preserve the world’s last great carbon sinks. “Forests and ocean nations are carrying the burden of the entire planet’s atmospheric balance,” he said. “The Amazon Basin, the Congo Basin, and the tropical forests of PNG and Southeast Asia together form the lungs of the earth. “Conserving them is the greatest mitigation effort we can make to save humanity itself. “When I first began this journey, I thought I was fighting to save our forests. “Now I realise I am fighting to save humanity. “Our forests, oceans and biodiversity sustain all life on earth – and without them, we have no future.” Marape told the participants at a thematic session yesterday that there was no substitute for the earth’s natural systems, urging them not to look to other planets for survival but to preserve the one they already inhabit. “There is no planet like earth,” he said. “Mars and Mercury are unliveable. Here, rivers, trees, mountains and oceans sustain life. “That is worth fighting for. “Our forests deserve proper conservation financing. “Nature-based technologies must begin by valuing standing forests – not just harvested timber. “One hectare of conserved forest can save the world far more than any industrial offset.” He urged the international community to deliver a new era of equitable climate finance. Meanwhile, Marape said PNG committed to halting large-scale deforestation, restoring degraded land and supporting sustainable development for local communities. He also highlighted PNG’s readiness to work with global partners to advance forest-nation diplomacy and operationalise long-term climate financing solutions. “For six years as prime minister, I have been saying: stop deforestation,” he said. “If this generation of leaders fail to find real financing solutions for forest nations, history will judge us harshly.”",Environment,Anticipation,James Marape,The National
Hope at last for displaced islanders,https://www.thenational.com.pg/hope-at-last-for-displaced-islanders/,11/11/2025,"HUNDREDS of Kadovar islanders living at a care center in East Sepik since 2018 will soon been permanently resettled at Kaup. This is according to the Department of Provincial and Local-level Government Affairs (DPLGA) staff who are in the province with a team from the Department of Lands and Physical Planning, the provincial and Wewak administration. It is understood that the government delegation was identifying and negotiating with the proposed Kaup landowners to acquire 97.6 hectares of land for permanent resettlement. The volcano on Kadovar, which is part of the Schouten Islands Group, erupted on Jan 5, 2018, which forced the islanders to the Wewak mainland. The displaced population was relocated to the Dandan Care Centre, which occupies a 3.5-hectare low-lying coastal area bordered by steep hills on one side and the sea on the other. According to the DPLGA, the acquisition of the land at Kaup would provide a long-term and secure settlement site for the islanders. The department in a statement said: “Consultations and land acquisition processes are currently progressing, with permanent relocation expected by mid-next year. “Since the displacement, the Internally Displaced Persons at Dandan Care Centre have relied heavily on food assistance. “The DPLGA has been providing food rations since 2019, while also leading efforts toward a sustainable and permanent resettlement programme. “The centre remains highly prone to flooding, especially during heavy rain. “Limited land space and unresolved ownership issues have restricted agricultural activities, preventing self-reliant food production and worsening nutrition and living conditions. “The proposed Kaup resettlement site offers safer and more sustainable living conditions. “Negotiations with Kaup landowners are ongoing to finalise the land acquisition process.”",Relocation,Trust,Nill,The National

Local member and Minister for International Trade and Investment Richard Maru presented a cheque of over K300,000 from the District Development Authority last Friday to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Construction (Smec) to start the study in December. The study is expected to take four months to complete. “The district has been plagued by power problems due to continuous power blackout in the Wewak grid and falling power poles which have not been attended to by PNG Power Ltd (PPL). “The longest (period of blackout) is at four months now which has affected the schools, hospitals, businesses and the villages,” he said. He said the proposed Sikau Hydro will be an independent mini grid and there are plans to sell the power as an independent power producer. The DDA plans to invite PNG Power to be one of the first foundation shareholders in this project along with the Yangoru-Saussia DDA and the landowners. This is part of the DDA’s commitment to this project by funding the pre-feasibility study before seeking assistance from other stakeholders on the cost of full feasibility study and the construction which would be over K50 million. Meanwhile work has started on a new standby power station at Haripmo in the Sepik Plains. The Yangoru-Saussia DDA bought two generators for the purpose.

Former Prime Minister Peter O’Neill echoed the public servants’ warning contained in the mid-year economic and fiscal outcome in a statement on Thursday. Said O’Neill: “According to a Finance Department written brief of Nov 3 (Monday last week), more than K1,209,000,000 of last year’s Finance Department cheques had been paid out of this year’s budget with over K160 million from last year still to be cashed by Finance. “Furthermore, the Finance brief points out that if all cheques were presented and paid, the Waigani Public Account would be overdrawn by K1.6 billion. “Marape is robbing this year’s budget to pay last year’s bills. “He is expecting public servants to undertake terrible administrative irregularities just so that he can continue to be cashed up to stay in power. “The brave public servants in Treasury have made it clear there is rampant manipulation going on with their red flag warning on page 52 of the outcome report: “Using this year’s revenue and financing (loans) to fund last year’s cheques could affect this year’s budget execution. “This vicious cycle could continue if large cheque floats are allowed into the next fiscal year. “The Marape government is writing out cheques without having the money to honour them and using the next year’s budget to pay last year’s bills. “We can assume their political masters will expect Treasury and Finance staff to cop the blame when things do not go to plan.” O’Neill further said democracy was decaying as fast as quality of life was slipping under Marape “Daily living costs have spiralled; wages have been stuck, and violent crime has increased considerably,” he said. “Power supply is going from bad to worse; our Kina is losing its value and medicines are simply not supplied. “GDP (gross domestic product) is growing due to the price of gold and commodities rising globally but investment in our country is shrinking due to a lack of confidence in the Marape government. “This is greatly impacting jobs growth.”",Business,Anger,Nill,The National

However, On Oct 30, the Private Business Committee rejected the motion because of Constitutional Amendment No 48 to Section 145 of the Constitution pertaining to motions of no confidence. Sir Puka said law and order collapsed under the leadership of Prime Minister James Marape. “Violent crime, tribal fighting, and armed robberies have become normal headlines. “Police are under-resourced and demoralised. Communities live in fear, and the government has lost control of maintaining basic safety for its citizens. “This is not leadership — it is neglect,” Sir Puka said. Sir Puka said the people wanted leadership that delivers results and ‘not endless talk.’ Sir Puka added; “Some question the timing of this motion, saying the elections are near. “But that is not a reason to sit idle while the country suffers. A lot of damage can still be done between now and 2027, and as we have seen in the last six years, it only gets worse. This motion had to be moved. Leadership means acting when it matters, not when it is convenient. “I understand that O’Neill is not without criticism, but I have personally witnessed a genuine change in his leadership since stepping down in 2019.

Rosso said that they are collaborating with State Enterprises (SOE) Ministry and the PNG Power Ltd (PPL) to fix the issue. “I also live in Lae and I am aware of the constant blackouts, but it is not an easy fix,” he said. “It is a mixture of power supply and an old grid in the city. “Therefore, we have transformers being blown up and lines collapsed. “But I can assure the people that after speaking with the PPL and the SOE Ministry, we will make sure to rectify the problem in the long run.” An old grid refers to the aging and unreliable electricity infrastructure managed by PPL. Rosso said that it would take a longer period to fix the power issue. “But I can assure everyone that we are working on it,” he said. “PPL has brought in 10 major gen-sets and are currently in the process of fitting them in at the Taraka substation. “They already got a 132kv transmission line that connect from Yonki all the way down to assist with the power problem in Lae.” The line is connected from Singsing to Lae through Erap and Taraka substations, constructing new towers and rehabilitating substations.

Asked to provide an update on the issues and challenges within some of the SOEs (state-owned enterprises), Duma said these were legacy issues surrounding the country’s utility company, and that ongoing work, including a possible public privatisation arrangement of PPL is being done to address them. He explained that there were ongoing challenges in modernising the aging (more than 50 years old) infrastructures across the country. “We still have ongoing challenges in terms of changing the attitudes of our workforce. We’ve been able to recruit a gentleman from New Zealand to be our CEO (for PNG Power),” Duma said. “There is a turnaround plan that has been endorsed by cabinet. And while, we are also working on the arrangement to partially privatise PNG Power, we are not waiting for the progression projects to be completed as early yet. “In the meantime, there’s ongoing work across the country to upgrade all our infrastructures. “We’ve had some challenges with the substation such as the continued work at Konedobu substation (Port Moresby). There’s some technical issues, and ongoing restoration work in Lae, which is a very important industrial city. “There’s ongoing work in Lae to ramp up the provision of power. There’s remedial work being done from Singsing Creek all the way down to Lae. “The ternary lines are being replaced slowly, and we’ve also ordered new generators to be able to provide good assistance for Lae at this time. So a lot of money has been invested.” He added that for Lae, there were also plans to put up a solar plane delay so that when one system is down, solar could then provide immediate, temporary relief. “So all of those are ongoing,” he said. “We’ve spent a lot of money and hopefully by the end of or middle of next year, you’ll see results for Lae. “There will be a complete turnaround. We are carrying out rehabilitation work for our Ramu generation facilities out there. “We have logistics challenges in continuing to provide reliable diesel for our power savings as we work.” Furthermore, regarding the ongoing bulk water supply issue in the urban areas in the country, Duma said it was again aging facilities and population increase challenges that they need to deal with. He said in Port Moresby, the Mt Eriama water treatment facility was designed for population of less than a million, about 500,000.

Tsiamalili said that getting the simple things right, like repatriating the retired officers back home and getting the uniforms for the police officers, are some of the things that are being looked into. He also challenged the serving police officers to look after the new officers who will graduate and join them in the future. He urged them to teach new cadets the good habits of discipline that they were taught at Bomana Police College. Tsiamalili thanked the landowners of Bereina who provided land to build the police houses. He also thanked Kairuku MP and Energy Minister Peter Isoaimo, who donated two open-back Toyotaland cruisers vehicles to Bereina police. The commissioning of the 10 houses were witnessed by senior police officers from police headquarters and the NCD/Central command, along with the police officers of Central and Kairuku MP, as well as the people of Mekeo and Bereina.",Government,Trust,Peter Isoaimo,The National
130 Grade 12 students graduate from Ogelbeng,https://www.thenational.com.pg/130-grade-12-students-graduate-from-ogelbeng/,10/11/2025,"WESTERN Highlands’ grades eight and 10 students will continue on to their next grades next year without going through the selection process, says an official. Education executive officer, Tony Buldung made this known to parents and students at the first Grade 12 graduation of Ogelbeng Lutheran Secondary School on Thursday. Buldung said the Education Department allowed Western Highlands among six other provinces to implement the policy “no examination for grades eight and 10” due to the high retention of enrolment in the province. Buldung, while congratulating the 130 Grade 12 students who graduated together with the 450 Grade 10, said the policy challenged students to work smart to get a placing in higher learning institutions after completing Grade 12. Also, the provincial government, through Governor Wai Rapa, is positioning itself to embrace the high number of Grade 12 student turnover by building technical and vocational education training (Tvet) institutions in the province, he added. Buldung said four new Tvet schools would be built in the four districts, bringing the number to seven. He said as part of a motivational programme, the provincial government also had an annual budget of K2,000 for each student who secured enrolment in higher learning institutions. The graduation was attended by officials from the province and the Education Department, with guest speaker James Anis Wapyer, a senior lecturer from the University of Papua New Guinea.",Education,Anticipation,Wai Rapa,The National
"Two dead, one million evacuated as Typhoon Fung-wong slams into the Philippines",https://www.thenational.com.pg/two-dead-one-million-evacuated-as-typhoon-fung-wong-slams-into-the-philippines/,10/11/2025,"ISABELA, Philippines: Typhoon Fung-wong ravaged the northern Philippines overnight, killing at least two people and cutting off some towns as residents emerged on Monday morning after a sleepless night to start assessing the damage. More than one million people were evacuated before Fung-wong made landfall as a super typhoon in the eastern town of Dinalungan in Aurora province on Sunday night. It pounded parts of the country’s main island of Luzon with fierce winds, heavy rain and storm swells through the night. The typhoon, locally named “Uwan”, damaged houses in the northern city of Santiago in Isabela province. Tree branches and electric posts were also felled by the typhoon. “We could not sleep last night because of the winds hitting our metal sheets and the tree branches falling,” said Romeo Mariano, who was sheltering with his grandmother in their home. “Almost all of the tree branches nearby fell, and when we got out to check our home, we saw the damage,” he added. At least two people were killed by the typhoon, according to an early report from the Civil Defence office, with two others injured. Aurora vice-governor Patrick Alexis Angara said at least three towns were inaccessible due to landslides and broken roads. The state weather agency said the typhoon was now moving over the South China Sea, and is forecast to shift northeast towards Taiwan. It warned that a large portion of the country still faced heavy rains and severe winds, along with storm swells in coastal areas. Over 400 flights have been cancelled since Sunday, the civil aviation regulator said. Fung-wong was the 21st storm to hit the Philippines this year and came immediately after Typhoon Kalmaegi, which last week killed 224 in the country and another five in Vietnam.

Eleven found dead in Thai-Malaysia search after Rohingya migrant boat sinks,https://www.thenational.com.pg/eleven-found-dead-in-thai-malaysia-search-after-rohingya-migrant-boat-sinks/,10/11/2025,"LANGKAWI, Malaysia: The number of people confirmed dead after a boat carrying members of Myanmar’s persecuted Rohingya community sank near the Thailand-Malaysia border rose to 11 on Monday, authorities said, with about 70 people believed to have been on board the capsized vessel. The status of another boat carrying 230 passengers remained unclear, Malaysian authorities said, adding that 13 survivors had been found so far, mostly Rohingya. Thai authorities said they had recovered four bodies, including two children, adding to the seven found by Malaysia’s maritime agency. Facing violence at home in Myanmar and increasingly difficult living conditions in sprawling refugee camps in Bangladesh, Rohingya from both countries regularly attempt perilous journeys by sea, including to Malaysia and Indonesia. Myanmar’s impoverished Rakhine state has suffered years of conflict, hunger and ethnic violence mostly targeting the Rohingya Muslim minority community. Driven from Rakhine following a brutal 2017 military crackdown, about 1.3 million Rohingya live as refugees in Bangladesh. At a press conference on the island of Langkawi, close to the search area, Malaysia’s maritime agency said air assets were being deployed by both Thailand and Malaysia to search for survivors. “We have got very good … relations with the Thai agency so we have got good communication and exchanges of information,” said Romli Mustafa, director of the maritime agency in Malaysia’s Kedah and Perlis. “It will be easier for us and our sea assets,” he said of the use of air assets to support the search by boats, adding that the search operation could last seven days. Romli said information received by the agency indicated a boat had departed Myanmar, near the border with Bangladesh, about two weeks ago, but some passengers had moved onto another vessel on Thursday. Of the 13 survivors, 11 were Rohingya and two from Bangladesh, he added. Source: Reuters",Disaster,Sadness,Nill,The National
South Korea special prosecutor indicts ex-President Yoon on more charges,https://www.thenational.com.pg/south-korea-special-prosecutor-indicts-ex-president-yoon-on-more-charges/,10/11/2025,"SEOUL: South Korea’s special prosecutor on Monday indicted former President Yoon Suk Yeol on additional charges of abusing power and aiding an enemy state related to his short-lived imposition of martial law last year. Yoon attempted to provoke military conflict between South and North Korea in order to declare martial law, a prosecutor’s spokesperson told a briefing, citing evidence found on a military official’s mobile phone that included some words suggesting potential provocations against North Korea, such as “drones” and “surgical strike”. Yoon was removed from office by the Constitutional Court in April and is on trial for insurrection stemming from his failed martial law declaration. If found guilty, he could be sentenced to death. Yoon has said consistently he never intended to impose military rule but declared martial law to sound the alarm on wrongdoings by opposition parties and to protect democracy from “anti-state” elements. According to the memo, Yoon, former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun and former military intelligence chief Yeo In-hyung planned to induce a North Korean attack against the South, the spokesperson, Park Ji-young, said. The trio conspired to create tensions in the country as a justification for Yoon to declare martial law, she said. Kim and Yeo were also indicted on the same additional charges, the prosecutor said. The special prosecutor’s team has accused Yoon and his military commanders of ordering a covert drone operation into the North to inflame tensions between the neighbours and justify his martial law decree. In October last year, North Korea said the South had sent drones to scatter anti-North Korean leaflets over Pyongyang, and published photos of the remains of a crashed South Korean military drone. Despite intense scrutiny and political pressure, South Korea’s military declined at the time to comment on the suspicion of conducting a drone operation. A defence ministry official on Monday said it had no comment on the matter. Former defence minister Kim is also on trial on charges related to the martial law declaration. Yeo has said he deeply regretted not challenging the order from Yoon, according to media reports. The prosecutor’s spokesperson said Yeo was making excuses that did not make sense about the notes discovered on his mobile phone. Source: Reuters",Politics,Fear,Nill,The National
"Trump to meet Sharaa at White House, capping major turnaround for Syria",https://www.thenational.com.pg/trump-to-meet-sharaa-at-white-house-capping-major-turnaround-for-syria/,10/11/2025,"WASHINGTON/RIYADH: Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s White House meeting with US President Donald Trump on Monday caps a stunning year for the rebel-turned-ruler who toppled a longtime autocratic leader and has since toured the world as he seeks to end Syria’s international isolation. Trump is set to welcome Sharaa in the first-ever visit by a Syrian president to the White House, six months after the pair first met in Saudi Arabia and just days after Washington said the former al Qaeda member was no longer a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist.” Sharaa, 42, took power last year after his Islamist fighters launched a lightning offensive from their enclave in Syria’s northwest and overthrew longtime Syrian President Bashar al-Assad just days later on Dec 8. Syria’s regional realignment has since moved at a dizzying pace, away from Assad’s key allies Iran and Russia and toward Turkey, the Gulf – and Washington. Security is likely to be a top focus of the meeting on Monday. The US is brokering talks between Syria and Israel on a possible security pact, and Reuters reported that the US is planning to establish a military presence at a Damascus airbase. Syria is also set to join a US-led coalition to fight Islamic State, which could be formally announced at Monday’s White House meeting. Days before the meeting, Trump told reporters at the White House that “a lot of progress has been made” on Syria. “I think he’s (Sharaa’s) doing a very good job. It’s a tough neighborhood, and he’s a tough guy, but I got along with him very well,” Trump said. After Sharaa and Trump met in Riyadh in May, Trump announced he would lift all sanctions on Syria. But the toughest measures, known as the Caesar Sanctions Act, require a repeal from Congress. The White House and State Department have publicly backed lifting them before 2025 ends, but experts say the government shutdown may affect that time frame.

The third candidate is Bulolo MP and Vice Mining Minister Sam Basil Jr. The special sitting will appoint an acting governor after the passing of Songang Luther Wenge. It has been adjourned to next week Thursday. “I received one of the resignations yesterday and the other this morning,” Rosso said. “Therefore, the Tutumang Special Sitting has been adjourned to next week Thursday to give enough time to process the resignation documents.” Tutumang’s deputy chairman Willie Simbisi said despite a full house at 10am on Friday, the assembly had to be adjourned because he did not receive any notice of resignation from Paita and Bomareo. “They have to submit their resignation to the National Executive Council who will then approve and decommission them and send a copy of their resignation to me as confirmation for them to be eligible to contest,” Simbisi said. “For now, I have not received any so they are disqualified; this extra week should give ample time for due process to take place until we convene next week Thursday.”",Politics,Anticipation,"John Rosso, Kobby Bomareo, Luther Wenge, Rainbo Paita, Sam Basil, Sam Basil Jr.",The National
"Fire service calls for exits, extinguishers in every home",https://www.thenational.com.pg/fire-service-calls-for-exits-extinguishers-in-every-home/,07/11/2025,"THE Papua New Guinea Fire Service has warned that it is a priority to have fire extinguishers and escape doors in every home in case of a fire and occupants need to get out. Gerehu fire station acting superintendent Johnson Charles was commenting on the early morning fire on Wednesday in Gordon, Port Moresby in which a family of six perished. “For that case at Gordon, there were people who wanted to help the occupants because they were crying for help and were struggling to escape,” he said. “But there was no fire exit, and the windows were grilled. “So they were trapped inside and couldn’t escape because the fire was blocking the entrance.” Charles urged home owners to seek advice from the four fire stations in Port Moresby about installing fire detectors. The fire service normally advises builders and home owners to install smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and to have an escape door. He also said that it would help the work of firefighters if bystanders do not interfere with their work. “Let us assess and do our jobs. That’s where the police help to control the crowd so that we can do our job. Another risk of being close is the water pressure from the hose-pipe which can be dangerous,” Charles said. “When there is a fire, the first thing you do is call the toll free number 1100. A vehicle will be sent. Don’t wait till too late. “It’s not only the job of the occupants to call. Everyone living in the area when noticing a fire must call.” Charles also explained that apart from the water in their trucks, they depended on the hydrants. “Sometimes we have water rationing in the city and there is not much pressure or the hydrants are removed due to construction. So we have to source water from the next hydrant,” he said. He added that hydrants must be installed every 100 metres by Water PNG. The inspections are carried out by the fire stations. “Water PNG erects the hydrants but we do the cleaning and painting so that they stand out. We check if they are working. If not working, we report to Water PNG and notify people living nearby to look after them,” he said.",Health,Sadness,Nill,The National

The school board and administration supported four of their students under the science stream and they came in 90th place out of the 181 countries that participated. Two teachers, Martha Aaron and Trevor Elia, had accompanied the students. Aaron said countries formed an alliance to challenge each other, so in order for them to win, it depended on how they worked together. “They had met challenges, but gave their best in the competition,” she said. There were three days of competition, therefore, the competing countries had 12 games each. Aaron stressed that the robotics team could do better if there was a national competition introduced to allow schools to participate and be more flexible when attending the global competition. “However, the schools will have to purchase their own kits, which is quite expensive,” she said. “It is a worldwide competition which helps students with problem-solving skills. This competition has helped some of our students who are currently at university taking engineering courses.” The school usually sends a team every year to compete in an educational programme which focuses on giving Papua New Guinean students an opportunity on the world stage. Aaron acknowledged the First Global, school board, Lae MP John Rosso, Wantok Auto Parts and BluePac Trading for their support for the team to take part. She said this competition will boost their confidence, knowledge and a experience to share with peers.

"Capacity building is key for national aspiration, says Powi",https://www.thenational.com.pg/capacity-building-is-key-for-national-aspiration-says-powi/,07/11/2025,"IMPROVING the capacity of government services and functions in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville is crucial in its pursuit of independence, Southern Highlands Governor William Powi says. Powi, a member of the Bipartisan Parliamentary Committee on Bougainville Matters, said capacity building was an issue that needed to be addressed during this transition period for Bougainville. He said many provinces also struggle with capacity building even after 50 years of PNG’s independence.  “Capacity building is a long-term effort. “This must be addressed before the ratification of the referendum results by Parliament,” he said. “We must ensure that there is a proper transfer of powers to Bougainville for them to manage their affairs. “This transfer of powers is one of the key pillars of the Bougainville Peace Agreement that has yet to be fully implemented. “This is a serious issue for both governments to consider. “The transfer of powers and functions should be in the region by now in preparation for this transition to take place and for them to build their capacity.” Powi, also the former chairman of the Bipartisan Parliamentary Committee on the Bougainville Peace Agreement, said their visit to the region in 2019 revealed a lack of capacity of the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG). “During our tour of Bougainville in 2019, we realised that there was a lack of capacity in a lot of the levels of government,” he said. “It was evident in the different aspects of the government such as human resource, procurement, revenue-generation and project implementation. “Once the capacity of the government is improved, there will be better services and functions provided for the people of Bougainville.” Former education secretary of Bougainville Joel Nava shared a similar view, as many key functions outlined in Part 14 of the Constitution were not granted to the ABG to administer.",Politics,Trust,William Powi,The National

"PM: PNG, Brazil carry burden of climate crisis",https://www.thenational.com.pg/pm-png-brazil-carry-burden-of-climate-crisis/,07/11/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has told Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva that forest and ocean nations like Papua New Guinea and Brazil “carry the burden of the world’s climate crisis”,” even though their carbon footprints are minimal. Speaking during a historic bilateral meeting on the margins of COP30 in Belém, Marape said Papua New Guinea’s presence at the summit was to reinforce solidarity with Brazil and other developing countries demanding fairness and justice in global climate action. “Excellency, I want to thank you sincerely for your warm welcome and hospitality since I arrived in your country,” Marape said. “Papua New Guinea has just celebrated 50 years of democracy since our independence from Australia in 1975. “Although we are on opposite sides of the world — you in South America and us in the Pacific — we have many things in common.” He said both countries were natural allies because of their vast forests, rich biodiversity, and shared experiences as developing democracies advocating for climate justice. “As a forest nation and an ocean nation, our carbon footprint is minimal, yet we are the victims of climate change,” he said. “Our forests and oceans carry the weight of the world’s excess carbon, but the benefits have not flowed equitably to our people.” Marape praised President Lula’s leadership on the global stage and his advocacy for climate justice and reform of the global financial system, which he said continues to favour industrialised nations in the north. “Mr President, I have followed you closely since your election and I commend your strong voice on issues that affect the Global South — on climate change, on global inequality, and on financial systems that benefit the rich and disadvantage developing countries,” he said. He said Brazil’s decision to host COP30 in the Amazon was “deeply spiritual and meaningful,” calling for discussions to focus not only on emissions but also on protecting the lungs and lifeblood of the planet — forests and oceans. “The conversation on climate change is wasted if we don’t talk about saving forests, saving oceans, and preserving biodiversity,” Marape said. “Forest nations are keeping the planet alive. We must be recognised and fairly compensated for that.” Marape said both Papua New Guinea and Brazil must continue pushing for justice and equity in global climate and trade negotiations, including greater recognition for the environmental services provided by forest nations. “The big carbon-emitting nations have not transitioned away from fossil fuels. Coal is still being used heavily in major economies,” he said. “Forest nations are doing their part, but the rewards and recognition have not come.” He reaffirmed PNG’s support for implementing Article 5.2 and Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, ensuring that carbon markets are transparent and that forest and ocean nations receive their fair share of climate finance. “Papua New Guinea stands with Brazil and the forest economies of the world to ensure that climate justice becomes real,” Marape said. “It must not just be a slogan — it must be lived reality for our people.” Marape recalled that as a student in 1992, he followed Brazil’s hosting of the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, saying it was meaningful to now return as Prime Minister to continue the work that began then. “It is deeply meaningful to be here where it all began, continuing the same message: let us save our forests, protect our oceans, and pass on a healthier world to our children,” he said.",Politics,Anger,James Marape,The National

Sir Bob also acknowledged and expressed his appreciation for “the important roles and contributions His Majesty’s Armed Forces played in the peaceful resolution of the Bougainville Crisis”. He pledged Papua New Guinea’s commitment for closer collaboration on issues of mutual interests such as climate change, sustainable development, management of the Pacific Ocean and its resources and combating illegal fishing. Earlier this week, Sir Bob and Lady Emeline attended a ground-breaking ceremony for the construction of a new Legislative Assembly building at ‘Talangaholo’, Royal Estate, Tufumahina. Sir Bob and Governor General of New Zealand, Dame Cindy Kiro participated in the ground-breaking ceremony with King Tupou VI. The former Parliament Chamber used for the Legislative Assembly for 126 years, was destroyed by tropical Cyclone Gita in 2018. Speaking at the ground-breaking ceremony, King Tupou VI said the site of the new Parliament building held historical significance in the reunification of Tonga and the “laws promulgated in the Va’vau Code (by King Tupou 1) to apply nationally” and set the stage for the 1875 Constitution of Tonga. “It was from (a) trip to Sydney in 1863 that (King) Tupou 1 saw landless indigenous people that influenced him to seek protection from this ever happening to Tongans in their own country,” he said. “He sought protection for Tongans being landless in their own land. “That protection, he believed, came partly from the Constitution and laws passed for the smooth running of a responsible parliament that is responsive to the needs of the Tongan people.” Sir Bob and Lady Emeline also attended a Remembrance Service programme during which Sir Bob took part in a wreath-laying ceremony alongside King Tupou VI in honour of former Sovereigns of Tonga, including King Tupou 1.

Minister looking to establish new body for health workers,https://www.thenational.com.pg/minister-looking-to-establish-new-body-for-health-workers/,07/11/2025,"A HEALTH Service Commission will be created to register all health works in the country, if minister responsible, Elias Kapavore has his way. Kapavore told a workshop in Port Moresby yesterday: “My aim now is to establish a Health Service Commission – like the Teaching Service Commission, where all health workers, upon graduation, are directly deployed to all Provincial Health Authorities in the country rather than having to wait for DPM (Department of Personnel Management) to give approvals. “The Government is committed to supporting Health. It’s now up to us to create the agenda and come up with the priorities with specifications and seek support. “Everyone coming out of the institutions must be posted to a position that is waiting for them. No more advertisement, no more going to DPM.” At the same time Kapavore directed his department to move to digital registration of health workers in the country by next June. The minister told a workshop that digital registration of all cadres of health workers is long overdue and a matter of critical concern. “We can’t continue the manual registration of health workers,” he said. Kapavore was speaking at a Port Moresby workshop, titled “Strengthening Health Workforce Program: Nursing Regulation and Accreditation.” He urged the medical and nursing registration divisions within Health Department to reorganize their offices and give prominence to digital registration. “Manual registration of health workers must cease immediately and establish efficient HR (human resource) data that must reflect the changing digital age,” Kapavore said. Kapavore reiterated that the PNG University of Medicine and Health Sciences Bill recently passed in Parliament is aimed at increasing enrolment to meet the health workforce gap. “This arrangement will complement the recently approved Health Services Commission arrangement,” he stated. “These are key revolutionary and milestone strategies that must now pave the way and set the scene for a modernised health sector workforce in PNG for the next fifty years. Kapavore acknowledged development partners including the Australian Government, World Health Organisation and others that continue to provide capacity building support for the country’s health workforce.",Health,Anticipation,Elias Kapavore,The National

Siguyaru said that during the attack between 8am and 8.30am, the eight suspects held up a passenger boat that was travelling from Lae to Siassi and took K20,000 meant for business transactions on SIassi Island. “The boat which  was carrying a woman, her baby and seven other passengers was held up by the pirates (who were) armed with four home-made guns and four bush knives. The suspects fired shots at the boat injuring the skipper, before attacking the passengers,” Chief Supt Siguyaru said. He said when the suspects boarded the boat, they assaulted three other men (passengers) and robbed them. “After the robbery, the sea pirates rammed the boat which caused it to sink off the Busu River delta. The suspects fled the scene while the boat and the passengers were left floating in open sea.” The incident was reported by by-standers which alerted the Lae Water police personnel who rescued the eight passengers. Morobe Water police then mounted activities at Voco Point from 7pm to 10pm on Tuesday night. “At around 10.20pm, the prime suspect was spotted by member of the Morobe Water police trying to return the stolen boat.

Partnership boosts healthcare in SHP,https://www.thenational.com.pg/partnership-boosts-healthcare-in-shp/,06/11/2025,"IN the rugged mountain ranges of Kagua-Erave district in Southern Highlands, the sound of helicopter blades brings hope, relief and lifesaving care. Children in Tiri village shout “chopa kam, chopa kam”  as they race barefoot to the grassy clearing that serves as a landing pad. For locals such as Selina Temo, the helicopter’s arrival is a symbol of connection. “The chopper coming means someone cares enough to reach us.” This quarterly medical patrol to hard-to-reach areas is made possible through a partnership between the Santos Foundation and the Southern Highlands Provincial Health Authority. SHPHA’s expanded programme on immunisation manager Alphonse Sambai said: “Reaching these remote communities is a powerful reminder of the barriers many still face. “The first airlift into areas unaware that support is coming is deeply moving and symbolic of the transformative impact and consistency of this partnership.” Jodie Hatherly, chief executive officer of the Santos Foundation said: “We are dedicated to creating opportunities and empowering communities where Santos operates. “Supporting health patrols in remote areas is one way we ensure our partnerships deliver real impact where it’s needed most.” It delivers healthcare to communities such as Tiri, Waposale, Mt Tawa, and Sopose, where the nearest health centre can be a week’s walk away. Health workers Timon Arufi, Sister Lilian Yamo, and Jethro Janget are flown in to provide care. From treating malaria and tuberculosis to administering vaccinations, antenatal care, and family planning, these patrols offer more than medicine, they bring dignity and connection. Janget, who became a health worker in 2019 after losing his mother, says: “Through these patrols, I help deliver essential care to remote communities, ensuring people receive treatment no matter where they live.” He recalls villagers walking five to six hours to reach patrol sites, mothers carrying babies through mountains, rivers, and swamps. While Jethro is dropped off at Tiri, the helicopter returns to Santos Moro Camp, where a dedicated Santos team ensures the safe transport of another dozen health workers and medical supplies to Mt Tawa and Sopose. Hundreds of people will be served during this patrol cycle. Sister Lilian Yamo, TB Coordinator at Ialibu District Hospital, recalls a defining moment in Waposale. “In 2024, we discovered TB in the village,” Yamo said. “Locals had many myths to explain the symptoms, but with Santos’ support, we confirmed a TB outbreak, treated over 300 patients, and raised awareness. “Today, it’s contained,” she said. Tiri ward councilor Jim Aiyepe said: “To access proper healthcare, we must walk a full day. There are threats – snakes, wild animals, bad weather. “We’ve lost family members along the way.” The patrols enable 1,087 children under five to receive vaccinations.

"Increased demand, theft, leaks reasons for water woes",https://www.thenational.com.pg/increased-demand-theft-leaks-reasons-for-water-woes/,06/11/2025,"GROWING population, water theft, leaks and bursts, deteriorating infrastructure, and outstanding debts of government agencies are the main causes of bulk water supply shortages in the country, says Water PNG chief executive officer James Young yesterday. Young highlighted that much of the outstanding bills held in Finance Department needed to be released to fix and maintain issues with water supply. The top 10 of these departments and agencies are Police, Defence, Correctional Services, hospitals, University of Papua New Guinea, Sports Commission, Works, Education, Agriculture and Livestock, and University of Natural Resources and Environment. “The current outstanding debt by government agencies, to be paid by the Department of Finance, is problematic as these funds should be immediately re-invested in infrastructure,” Young said. “Water PNG will continue to engage with the Department of Finance to recover these substantial outstanding debts, as well as those from large private sector debtors. “As it currently stands, there a very serious risk of imminent water network shutdown if contractors, staff and suppliers cannot be paid,” he said. He said that water interruptions were due to basic supply and demand, as well as many of the systems had been built in the 1960s and 1970s. This was made worse by substantial water theft through illegal connections to businesses and homes. According to reports in 2022, Water PNG losses in revenue for Water theft alone is around K50 million. “Preventative maintenance has been stepped up to try and stay ahead of busts and leaks, and we have rapid response teams that move quickly to rectify faults when they occur,” Young said. “At the same time we use any investment we are able to obtain to upgrade water networks. “In dealing with water theft, our investigators are detecting illegal connections in Port Moresby, Mt Hagen and other areas. “When these are found, the connection is cut off, bills with penalties are issued that have to be paid before reconnection, and we refer serious offenders to police for criminal prosecution.” Young said that reforms were underway to make it fairer and easier for customers to pay for their water including the introduction of smart meters. “Customers in homes and businesses can also help by being water-wise, and mindful of water wastage. “Every litre saved stays in the network and can be used by others, it also saves on customer water bills,” he said.",Infrastructure,Fear,Nill,The National

Before leaving for Cop30 on Tuesday, Marape said: “PNG is also uniquely qualified to advocate on the impact of climate change. “Our Mortlock and Carteret islanders were the first in our country to relocate due to sea level rise, soil salination and water contamination.” Marape said that PNG’s presence at Cop30, which is the main global forum under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change where world leaders negotiate and implement international climate agreements, was important as a forest nation. “This is an extraordinary Cop for Papua New Guinea and Brazil,” he said. “Brazil, the biggest forest nation, is hosting it. So, a large forest nation is hosting the conference for the first time. “This aligns with Article 5 and Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which focuses on forests and forest resource management.

He also emphasised that climate change discussions were incomplete without acknowledging forest resource management and sustainable ocean governance. “We are renowned for our biodiversity while our oceans and forests hold tremendous ecological value. “The world has invited us into high-level global discussions on this matter.

Marape made the revelation as he commended his envoy to the 2025 Apec, Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso, for leading the PNG delegation and for expressing PNG’s interest to host the summit. “It was a good meeting for us. Our presence was evident. I want to announce to our country that the Apec secretariat has accepted our bid to host Apec 2033,” he said. Marape made the announcement at his departure press conference early this morning to Sydney enroute to Brazil for the United Nations climate summit, COP30. Apec meetings are hosted by a different member economy each year on a voluntary, rotational basis, with the selection process largely based on consensus among all 21 member economies. However, the selection for host is not a competitive public ‘bidding’ system in the traditional sense, but an internal co- ordination and agreement process involving voluntary offers, consensus decision and advance planning. The consensus for PNG as host in 2033 will make it the second time PNG will host the Apec Leaders’ Summit after 2018. Marape also revealed that PNG is posed to host the United Nations Oceans Conference – widely known as the “global oceans conference”– in 2030, as the country prepares to deposit its ratification at the UN next year to reserve up to 30 percent of its ocean spaces for conservation. “We are hosting an oceans economic ministers’ forum next year,” he said. “This is a precursor to 2030, where there is a high possibility that PNG will host the global oceans conference, similar to the one we attended in Nice, France last year. “We have put our hands up for it and France and many of our partner nations have offered us support.” “Hosting the global oceans conference is confirmation by the global community of PNG’s role.”",Business,Trust,"James Marape, John Rosso",The National
Ex-servicemen call on government to pay outstanding entitlements,https://www.thenational.com.pg/ex-servicemen-call-on-government-to-pay-outstanding-entitlements/,06/11/2025,"A GROUP of former soldiers are appealing to the Government to honour its commitment and pay them what they say are unpaid entitlements in the form of the State component of 60 per cent and others in the form of pension under the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Fund managed by the Comrade Trustees Services Ltd (CTSL). They said the delays had caused a lot of misery and inconvenience for their families and some of them have waited since 2002. Apart from the entitlements, they are also appealing to the government to fix what they call are systemic failures within the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, the Comrade Trustees Services Limited and the Bank of Papua New Guinea that had denied a lot of members to miss out on benefits they are entitled to. Spokesperson of the group who call themselves Reorg Rehab, retired Corporal Rex Wararu, explained that in 2015, through a submission made by CTSL, the National Executive Council made a decision to make changes to the DFRBF from a defined benefit scheme to a dual system of accumulation and defined for those who were recruited before 2015. Under the defined benefits scheme, the government does not pay its component until a soldier is retrenched where they get a 60 per cent guaranteed pay out. Under the accumulation scheme, the employer (Government) portion was paid every fortnight. Wararu, who was retrenched in 2000 after 29 years in the force during the government’s downsising exercise, said he had been fighting for the State component of his entitlements since leaving the force. Another member ex-private Danny Sakail said he wanted the government to look into what he called systemic failures within the retirement fund: “We are not merely demanding our State share, we are demanding full restitution of credit-rated payments and interest unlawfully denied to us under this fund architecture in the last half a century.” CTSL management when contacted about the issue have denied that the fund owes the soldiers any entitlements and have called for the ex-servicemen to meet them if they have any queries. The Nationalunderstands that State owes millions of Kina in unfunded liabilities to the Defence Force Retirement Benefit Fund, managed by CTSL. The liability stems from the government’s obligation to pay the employer’s portion of contributions and accumulated interest for members. The delay in payment may have prevented some personnel who have reached retirement age.",Business,Anger,Nill,The National

The minister has been asked to provide answers for why urgent maintenance have not been done at the Baisu Correctional Facility in Western Highlands. It is understood Judge Ellis used his own initiative to take this course of action after finding out that the condition of the facility risks a mass breakout and further that the entire facility might be forced to close. Baisu houses prisoners from Eastern Highlands, Enga, Jiwaka, Hela, Southern Highlands and Western Highlands. An officer from Minister Kuli yesterday confirmed receipt of the correspondence from the judge. Minister Kuli has been given to 4pm Friday, Nov 14, to provide an adequate answer as to why budgeted repairs have not been made and when such work might commence. Acting Correctional Services (CS) commissioner Bernard Nepo explained at a media conference that the office did not receive an amount of K49 million for the upgrading of Baisu prison as was reported on social media. In 2023, some of its buildings including the security cell blocks, and the building where the prisoners’ rations are stored, have been condemned by the provincial health authority, as they deemed unfit for human habitation. Judge Ellis after concluding a trial in Baisu discovered these issues for himself, leading him to take the action he did. He is writing to Kuli so that the court may determine whether it was necessary to make further orders or declarations for the purposes of enforcement of Basic Rights under Section 57(3) of the Constitution. That particular provision and Sect 57(1) outlines the power the court exercises on its own merit to enforce the rights and freedoms of accused persons and person who have been sentenced to serve their time at the Baisu facility. In a letter published byThe Nationaldated Feb 28, 2024, a citizen raised his concerns for Baisu prison’s urgent renovation. The article stated that the facility (correctional institution), being the largest and oldest ever established in the Highlands region, caters for more than 1,000 convicts and prisoners at any one time and has not been maintained for more than a decade.",Law,Fear,Joe Kuli,The National

They have been under the supervision of the neonatal and specialist teams. After extensive consultations, examinations and assessments by a multi-disciplinary clinical team, both infants were found to have complex congenital anomalies. Director Medical Services Dr. Kone Sobi said the team had conducted multiple medical consultations, including with pediatric surgeons and counterparts in Australia. “The underlying thing is that both twins have significant congenital anomalies and we feel that even with care and treatment in the highly specialized units, the chances of survival are low,” he said. “And based on that we feel that both twins will remain with us and we will continue to provide care as long as possible. That is basically our stand.” He said that they had discussed the situation with the family members and “it’s very difficult if you put yourself in those circumstances for family to come to grip with this scenario”. “There have been concerns of getting them to Australia, from a medical point of view, based on the conditions of the babies, it is not possible. “Where they go from here it’s anyone’s guess.

Country’s population growth rate ‘one of Pacific’s highest’,https://www.thenational.com.pg/countrys-population-growth-rate-one-of-pacifics-highest/,05/11/2025,"PAPUA New Guinea’s annual population growth rate of 2.6 per cent is one of the highest in the Pacific, according to acting National Statistician John Igitoi. “Papua New Guinea’s population growth is one of the fastest and highest growing in the Pacific region, determined mainly by births and deaths,” he said. “On average, each reproductive mother, from 17 to 49 years of age, bears one child after every three years. “Since the last official population count of 7.2 million in 2011, it is practically and statistically not possible in PNG to have a population of over 12 million people. “However, the final population count for 2024 is still very high and is capable of causing a lot of strain on government infrastructure and facilities, and has the potential to drain its resources if unchecked and uncontrolled. “The current population number still places us at the lower middle end of per capita income among the global economies.” Last year’s population census report by the National Statistical Office shows 10,185,363 people – 5,336,546 men and 4,848,817 women. Of that, 5,827,441 persons are over the age of 18. The report states that Southern (3.6 per cent) had the highest regional annual growth rate, followed by Momase (3 per cent), New Guinea Islands (2.3 per cent) and Highlands (1.9 per cent). The fastest growing provinces were the National Capital District, Western, Milne Bay, and Madang, each recording more than 3 per cent average annual growth rate since 2011. Meanwhile, Prime Minister James Marape said PNG’s demographic and economic history had shown that the country’s population has tripled since 1975, while economic growth has been stagnant. “The population has grown by 2.6 per cent annually, increasing by approximately 2.9 million persons in the past 13 years, underscoring the urgency of managing population growth in line with the nation’s economic strength.”",Demographics,Fear,James Marape,The National
Data could be used for political gain: Economist,https://www.thenational.com.pg/data-could-be-used-for-political-gain-economist/,05/11/2025,"AN economist has warned that the national population data collected from last year’s census should be used only for planning, and not for any political purpose. Institute of National Affairs executive director Paul Barker said: “Politicians need to utilise the outcome of the census data, including for national and local planning and monitoring purposes, but should not be engaged or interfering in the process itself, as clearly the statistics must be immune from perceived manipulation or slant. “Politicians need to approve budget allocations for the conducting statistical collection and analysis, but, as with electoral processes, should be well removed from the operations and presentation of the outcomes. “Political input doesn’t lend the process credibility as they are seen to have a politically vested interest in the outcome. “Of course, there are some political advantages of having a lower population, in term of economic performance, per capita income and trends. “There can also be pressures to inflate the figure, as per constituencies and for allocations.” Barker argued that any population data collected from a census is crucial for development planning and should not be used as political tools to exploit the people. He added that the recently released population data needed to be reviewed as it could be manipulated during the 2027 General Election. “A census is very much a technical and statistical exercise that needs credibility. It was a worry when the Government launched the 2024 census as it entailed so much political fanfare. “The administration of the census seemed somewhat shambolic from the start, with real governance concerns raised as well, as with the tablets purchased not seemingly through a conventional tender process entailing information technology firm, but awarded to a timber-associated business run, reportedly, by persons associated with politically exposed persons. “This did not provide a good look. “This is why in many countries, the statistical office is protected by laws of independence and standards, and often reports directly to the legislature, rather than specifically to a minister of the executive government.”",Politics,Fear,Nill,The National

He said the people demanded to know how this year’s budget was spent and who got what and how much. A chart on the government budget shows the provincial service improvement programme (PSIP) and district service improvement programme (DSIP) allocation at 5.2 per cent, which is equivalent to K1.5 billion. The graph shows that the government has a bloated recurrent budget of K22 billion that includes DSIP and PSIP at K1.5 billion, education at K4.4 billion, health at K2 billion, law and justice at K2.3 billion, utilities at K1.4 billion, administration at K5.6 billion, debt servicing at K3.5 billion and others at K0.7 billion. The capital investment budget includes Transport at K2 billion and Provinces at K4.4 billion — to fund roads, bridges, wharves, and airports, plus capital grants to sub-national programmes. However, since 2018, lack of resources especially funding had hindered its progress causing a backlog of reports to the DIRD. Reports show only 59 districts and provinces have not acquitted with the main reason being lack of funding, logistics, newly formed districts and other administration issues. This figure is most likely to be carried over to next year adding to a backlog of acquittals from 2018 is yet to reach DIRD. “The Prime Minister admitted that K56 billion in six years produced no results.

Councillor Simon Komp of Kindeng block said the Tuman zone had 25,000 populations in the 2022 electoral roll for the eight existing wards of which the big voting population warranted new wards. Komp said there was nothing sinister about creating the new wards, and the wards were created in the Anglimp LLG chamber, where president Nicholas Kurua was the chief signature to the endorsement of the motion to create the wards. However, Nicholas Kurua took the matter to the National Court for reasons only known to him, where the court dismissed the application while another attempt made by North-Waghi MP Benjamin on the same case was also dismissed.

"NSO faced significant challenges which delayed census, says Igitoi",https://www.thenational.com.pg/nso-faced-significant-challenges-which-delayed-census-says-igitoi/,04/11/2025,"ACTING National Statistician John Igitoi said the National Statistical Office (NSO) faced significant logistical challenges during last year’s census, which delayed the release of final population figures. He said NSO deployed over 35,000 field officers and data collectors across 398 local level governments (LLGs), 6,908 wards, and 30,501 villages. “NSO deployed them to those households to count our people, to ensure they were recorded on the government’s official database. “Added to these challenges were the critics of the Government and the NSO questioning our ability to deliver the census,” he said. Igitoi said despite the population headcount being a resource-intensive exercise, NSO was able to complete it in less than two years after one year three months of data collection, data verification and data processing. The 2024 NSO population census report shows a total of 10,185,363 people in the country, with 5,336,546 men and 4,848,817 women. Of the total, 5,827,441 persons were over the age of 18. The report says: “This represents an increase of 40 per cent (2,910,039 people) in PNG’s population count since 2011 (7,275,324). “The average annual growth rate over the past 13 years, since the 2011 census, was 2.6 per cent. “Annual growth rate since the 2011 census is higher (3.1 per cent) but is likely to be artificially inflated because of non-demographic factors such as higher undercounting in 2000 and improvements to the 2011 and 2024 census coverage methods. “More males than females were counted in PNG on census night (52.4 per cent and 47.6 per cent of the total population, respectively). “This represents approximately 110 males to every 100 females. “The average number of people per household was five for PNG. “Since the first census in 1980, five years after independence, there have been an additional 7.2 million people added from 3.0 million in the last 44 years.” Of the 22 provinces, Morobe had the highest population with 997,545, and Manus the lowest with 69, 560.",Business,Trust,Nill,The National
Disaster happened in area prone to landslips: Officials,https://www.thenational.com.pg/disaster-happened-in-area-prone-to-landslips-officials/,04/11/2025,"THE tragic killing of 21 people at Kukas village in the Minamb Valley of Enga occurred at a communal house built in an area susceptible to landslips. The joint disaster assessment team deployed to Kukas village in Enga’s Wapanemanda on Friday found that the area was susceptible to landslips and that homes were not built in the area for that reason. The communal building was used to accommodate visitors from the Yambalikin tribe of Lower Lai many kilometers distant who had come to attend a funeral at Kukas. Tragically, the people were unable to return home on Thursday due to renewed tribal fighting in Wapenamanda between the Yangakun and Yakuman tribes which prevented any access. The team comprising officers from the Enga disaster center, Wapanemanda district administration, National Disaster Center (NCD) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), visited the site that was covered in a landslide in the early hours of Friday. The report said the landslide in Kukas, Minamb Valley, killed 21 people hospitalised five, and traumatised 45 others. Of the 21 deaths, 17 were males, and four females including two children and a pregnant woman. Two food gardens were destroyed including the communal house where the people from Lower Lai were accommodated on Thursday night. Most of the deaths were from the Yambalikin tribe of Lower Lai, except one from Yarapaki tribe. They came for a funeral service at Kukas. In the joint operation, the IOM activated its Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) Emergency Event Tracking (EET) tool to assess the situation. The report noted that loosened soil, unstable slopes, and ongoing water seeping across the Minamb Valley, created conditions that pose a continued risk of secondary landslides. The affected site is situated less than five meters from the Minamb River, where sustained heavy rainfall likely exacerbated the instability of the already saturated ground. The report said the disaster response team provided the required support which included retrieving the bodies, medical evacuation to the survivors and providing relief assistance to affected families. The report said due to ongoing tribal fighting in Wapenamanda, the provincial administration sought consent from families of the deceased to transport the bodies to Paradise Funeral Home in Mt Hagen on Friday evening. The deceased remain under the care of the Enga government, and the joint assessment team recommended that communities residing along the affected slope consider relocating to safer areas, given the continuous rainfall and unstable conditions. The team also recommended maintaining regular security patrols to help ensure safety in the area due to the tribal conflict in Wapenamanda. As a result, travel from Wabag to the affected area is considered unsafe without a security escort. Access from Mt Hagen remains open and is currently being used as the preferred route for response and assessment teams. As part of its programming, IOM has strengthened the capacity of local authorities in Enga in mental health and psychosocial support services (MHPSS). To ensure an effective coordinated response to the landslide in Kukas village, the following actions were recommended:",Disaster,Sadness,Nill,The National

Provincial police commander Supt Joseph Salle said: “I am happy with how the people of Central are behaving during the election, even though eligible voters have raised issues regarding their names not being on the common roll and the shortage of ballot papers. “However, they have come to an understanding and proceeded with the voting, which is nearing completion. “Most of the ward councillors have been declared, while the other wards are still voting. “After all ward councillors are declared, the election officials will continue to count the LLG president votes.” Salle said three persons have been arrested and are detained at 15-Mile police station for hijacking ballot papers during polling last week, adding that police officers would only assist when the need arises at the polling venues. He said that the issue leading to the hijacking of the ballot papers was due to the limited number of ballot papers compared to the eligible voters there, urging the Electoral Commission to address this issue immediately to prevent such incidences from happening again. Salle confirmed that there were no major incidents reported, except for only one at a ward in the Hiri -Koiari LLG. Polling ends on Saturday (Nov 8).",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National

Powi said the recent unrest was linked to the many discrepancies found in the 2025 voter enrolment figures across wards which needed to be verified to prevent further problems. “These discrepancies should be verified and cross-checked against the 2022 figures and properly assessed,” he said. “However, polling has already started, and we cannot change the rules or the roll mid-process. “Our duty now is to protect life, uphold order, and record every anomaly for the proper authorities to address.” Powi said he had reported the matter to the Electoral Commission and the Department of Provincial and Local-Level Government Affairs, through the provincial election steering committee. “We have institutions of government for a reason,” he said. “Respect for the rule of law and following the proper process leads to good governance and respect for leadership. “We are not playing cards or gambling with people’s lives – leadership is a serious business. “We must live up to it with simplicity, humility, and the values of respect and humanity – not the arrogance of someone in a hurry.” Powi called for the immediate implementation of the following: “Our people have not had sufficient time to verify and confirm the new voter rolls,” Powi said. “That is why Basin communities are raising serious concerns. “People will not participate in LLG and district democracy if that democracy is compromised.” But now that elections are in progress, we must proceed within the law, keep the peace, and channel disputes into the proper forums.” He urged the local people to stop the violence and allow the police and courts to function, while authorities document issues and prepare for a thorough review.",Politics,Fear,William Powi,The National

Toroama emphasised Bougainville’s clear path to political independence, citing the overwhelming vote for independence as outlined in the PNG Constitution. He stressed the need for the PNG Parliament to honour the people’s choice through the Melanesian Agreement and Sessional Order. On governance, Toroama advocated for Bougainville to become a true republic with a directly elected president, free from the constraints of the current hybrid system. He also called for institutional reforms to ensure governance aligns with the new republican system. Toroama stressed that economic independence must start at the family and community levels, ultimately contributing to Bougainville’s long-term prosperity. “At the government level, my government will first of all ensure that Panguna quickly progresses to the next stage of development,” he said. Regarding economic development, Toroama highlighted several key projects: Toroama challenged the leaders to take the lead in practicing good governance and called on citizens to follow the rules and laws of the land. He reiterated that the transformation he was advocating for under the three agendas mentioned is not difficult to achieve with co-operation at all levels and roles that leaders and citizens played in Bougainville society.

Economist questions 2024 census results,https://www.thenational.com.pg/economist-questions-2024-census-results/,03/11/2025,"AN economist has questioned the credibility of the result of last year’s national census, and called for a more extensive review and verification of the recently released population data. Institute of National Affairs executive director Paul Barker said: “The administration of the 2024 census seemed somewhat shambolic from the start, with real governance concerns raised as well. From various mini-sample surveys around the country, and ad hoc feedback online, it appears that a substantial portion of the population was never censured, even in the National Capital District where the population was relatively accessible. “From many small samples around the country, people said their households were never visited, or if they were, either the forms were not received or the filled forms never collected. “Maybe, following extensive credible and independent verification, the latest census figures, nationally and sub-nationally, will prove correct. But at this stage, there remains a disappointing and expensive lack of desirable certainty.” Comparing census events from previous years, he noted that a lower budget was allocated for the 2024 census, and that crucial questions to understand the country’s demography were left out. He added that population data was crucial for all development plans for the country, including the common roll update. “For the 2024 census, there was a significantly lower budget allocated, in relation to prior exercises, which meant that it was going to need to be conducted on a relative shoestring, requiring mechanisms to apply efficiencies. “As a result, the National Statistical Office (NSO) slashed the questions, leaving little more than a head count, and omitting valuable questions like the level of education of respondents, and whether or how they were employed – which were included in prior censuses. “It is unfortunate that, especially in the lead-up to the preparation of the electoral roll for the 2027 election, a census outcome has not been reached, which provides wholesale reassurance, let alone beyond a mere head count.” Barker recommends that the data released by the NSO be properly verified for more accuracy about the country’s population. “The test of accuracy will depend on closer examination of provincial and local data, using trends, cross-checking reliable local data from the past and present, including from other reliable sources, and records from village recorders and specific local surveys,” he said.",Business,Disgust,Nill,The National
Citizens urged to consider responsible family planning,https://www.thenational.com.pg/citizens-urged-to-consider-responsible-family-planning/,03/11/2025,"PAPUA New Guineans have been urged to seriously consider responsible family planning given the current socio-economic state of the country. Prime Minister James Marape warned that the rapid population growth could outpace the nation’s economic capacity if not properly managed. “From conception to adulthood, it can cost up to K5 million to give a child a decent, modern upbringing,” he said. “Parents must think carefully. It is not about how many children you have, but about the quality of life you can provide for them.” Marape urged young couples to consider limiting their families to two or three children, warning that the cost of raising a child to adulthood in the current state of the county was an expensive exercise. He said that a Government proposal would have the first two or three children in a family receiving full education support, while additional children would be the responsibility of parents. “This is a conversation we must have maturely in churches, communities, and families. A sustainable country must have its economy growing faster than its population.” He also announced plans to make population monitoring a continuous process, urging all provincial administrations to work with health facilities to ensure that every birth and death is recorded. This, he said, would enable accurate and efficient census exercises conducted in the future. Meanwhile, Marape said PNG’s demographic and economic history showed that the population had tripled since 1975, while economic growth has been stagnant. “For the first 27 years, our economy grew at less than 0.3 per cent while our population rose at around 3 per cent,” he said.",Economy,Fear,James Marape,The National

He said that this round of census by the National Statistical Office would ensure that estimates would no longer be used. “Since the 2011 national population census, our understanding of the people of this country are based on outdated information and estimates using both conventional and unconventional statistical method. “This census was a very resource intensive exercise, and for the first time, we used technology for data collection in this round of census, on a very large scale, which has assisted us to reduce time lag by more than one year compared to the previous censuses. “The final population figures in the previous four other censuses were often announced after more than two years. “For this round of census, we are announcing it after one year three months of data collection, data verification and data processing.”",Development,Trust,Nill,The National

Urame confirmed that the facility belonged to the Good News Lutheran Church, under the Lutheran Health Services. “It was built by volunteers from the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod between 1955 and 1957; dedicated on 22nd June 1957.” “I talked with the Bishop of the Good News Lutheran Church in Enga and received confirmation of the destruction of the Mambisanda rural hospital (on Thursday night).” “Warlords attacked the hospital and burnt down staff houses.” Urame said no lives were lost. “The police and soldiers moved in and guarded the hospital and protected the hospital community,” he said. “Staff houses were burnt down while parts of the hospital were saved.” Urame said tribal fighters were a threat to people, to peace and harmony in the community and called on the government to come down hard on these men who causing destruction in the province.

DPLLG secretary Philip Leo confirmed that the OLPLLG governs the process of electing a new provincial governor in various circumstances, such as the untimely passing of Morobe’s late Governor Wenge. He said the OLPGLLG does not make provision for an “Acting Provincial Governor” nor a “caretaker Provincial Governor”, in the event of a vacancy. Section 21 of the OLPGLLG states that: “If the provincial governor vacates his office in accordance with Section 19(1)”, as in this case, the provincial assembly shall, from amongst the members of the assembly including members of the parliament, elect the provincial governor, under the chairmanship of the deputy governor, he said. “It is important to note that Tutumang has the authority to conduct this election process under its own Standing Orders, as provided for in Section 7 of the Provincial Government Administration Act 1997.” There has been calls by the people – some calling for a by-election to maintain transparency and democracy, a leader elected by the people.

He said that the outage on Oct 18 and 19 was the result of a faulty equipment at the hospital. “The Angau Hospital is an essential public service and a priority for electricity distribution in Lae,” he said. “There was no disruption to the PNG Power feed. “On Oct 18, there was an internal malfunction within the Angau Hospital’s own 415-volt switchboard which is maintained by a private contractor to the hospital. “PNG Power offered assistance to Angau, but were advised by hospital administration that a private contractor were dealing with the issue. “Under the direction of the PNG Power chief technical officer, workers remained on standby if required to assist. “The switchboard malfunction meant that the hospital could not receive electricity either from PNG Power or from the hospital’s generator. “PNG Power would have preferred that the hospital had asked PPL engineers to fix their internal switchboard problems instead of engaging private contractors.” Duma said the question in Parliament raised by MP Patrick Basa to Health Minister Elias Kapavore was genuine. “This was a decision made by the hospital, but there are misleading claims by faceless keyboard warriors trying to manipulate the public and they should be ashamed of themselves,” he said. “Public healthcare is a priority for all members of the Parliament and debate is important, it is disappointing that people with an agenda seek to mislead the people.” Angau is a major hospital and second largest referral hospital in the country providing much needed public healthcare services.",Business,Anger,"Elias Kapavore, Patrick Basa, William Duma",The National
Police shoot and kill two in highway looting incident,https://www.thenational.com.pg/police-shoot-and-kill-two-in-highway-looting-incident/,03/11/2025,"POLICE in Madang have shot dead two armed men after a confrontation between the locals and the police at Naru section of the Ramu-Madang Highway last Thursday, says Madang police commander acting Superintendent Robert Baim. The incident happened after a confrontation between locals and police personnel that were sent from Madang to stop locals from looting a truck. The truck was loaded with cartons of tinned fish from Lae heading to Madang and had a mechanical fault which forced it off the road. “The people then chased off the driver of the truck and his crew and started looting the 20-foot container truck,” Baim said. “The first police unit that was sent there was outnumbered by criminals and members of the community.” It was also reported that while the women and children took away the looted items from the truck, some youths started taking off valuable parts of the truck like car stereo, battery, tyres and other parts of the vehicle. Baim also said that commuters along that part of the highway at that time were also harassed by criminals and members of the community there as well. “An additional police task force unit was sent there late on Thursday and the situation was contained, but some minutes later, the villagers retaliated and attacked the police with offensive weapons.” He said the confrontation between the police and the locals went on for an hour and the police personnel were attacked from all directions and were outnumbered at that time. Baim said the two men that were shot dead during the confrontation were armed and were among the members of the community and were trying to fight back at the police when they were shot during the shoot-out. He further warned anyone or opportunists trying to interfere with the travelling public along that section of the highway will face police.",Crime,Anger,Nill,The National

With the LPV, every eligible voter now has the right to choose their LLG president making it more democratic and transparent. “The system gives people confidence that their votes truly count.” According to from Electoral Commission, the use of LPV in selected provinces is to strengthen democracy and improve voter participation at the community level.",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National

He said polling generally started slowly each day but ran smoothly overall. However, many voters were turned away at different locations because their names were not on the Common Roll. Melodi added that large and scattered wards such as Takekel, Vunagogo and Tinganagalip made access difficult for residents, and suggested two days of polling should be allocated for such areas. He said all teams are expected to finish today, except the Team who are doing counting at Tavuiliu as they will complete polling on Friday. Counting for the president’s seat will start next Monday. Meanwhile, the LLG is into its third day of counting votes for ward member seats. Melodies said counting began on Tuesday, starting with wards that completed polling the previous day. Only two ballot boxed were counted on the first day, from Karavi 1 and Latlat, due to a slow start. He also noted that the slow start on Tuesday was caused by the late arrival of the scrutineers.

NSO: PNG’s population now stands at 10 million,https://www.thenational.com.pg/nso-pngs-population-now-stands-at-10-million/,31/10/2025,"PAPUA New Guinea’s current population officially stands at 10,185,363, following the census conducted by the National Statistical Office (NSO) last year. Prime Minister James Marape announced the figure in Port Moresby last night – 13 years after the nationwide headcount conducted in 2011. The 2024 population census report by the NSO indicated that of the 10,185,363 persons in the country, 5,336,546 are men and 4,848,817 are women. Of the total, 5,827,441 persons are over the age of 18. Marape said this would be the numbers used by the Government and agencies in development planning for the future. “The economic growth of our country has not been equal to the population growth,” he said. “With the population figure now announced, it will be the basis upon which the Government and all agencies must work with. “It will also allow us to properly allocate funding and resource equally to all provinces and districts. “Going forward, we must ensure that our development plans align with our growing population.” Marape said that with PNG still a developing country, having a high population could put a strain on the economy. He said that the Government would consider implementing family planning policies to manage the growing population. Under the Ministry of Administrative Services, the NSO was tasked to conduct the K200 million exercise initially set from June 16 to 30 last year. June 16 was the reference night – the point in time reorded when and where a person spent the night before counting began on June 17. Authorised by the Statistical Services Act, the NSO is required to conduct a census every 10 years, ensuring that every citizen and foreigner in the country is recorded. PNG has only had five census after the first one in 1980 recorded a population of 3.1 million. In 1990 and 2000, a population of 3.8 million and 5.5 million were recorded respectively. The fourth census in 2011 saw 7.8 million persons counted. The fifth, planned for 2021, was deferred to last year. Acting National Statistician John Igitoi said despite the challenges during the census exercise, the NSO was able to produce the population figures with the support of its stakeholders and development partners. “This investment in the census will help with the Government’s development agendas through more population-focused programmes,” he said.","Demographics,Trust",,James Marape,The National

He said that 2026 would be focusing on integrating data between the National Statistical Office and the Electoral Commission, improving logistic and fixing election integrity measures. “Every citizen has a responsibility to make sure they are enrolled to vote.

Prime Minister James Marape, in welcoming the initiative, said: “There is no greater investment than investing in doctors, laboratory technicians, and the health infrastructure of our nation. “PNG faces many challenges in the health sector. At one point during the Covid-19 pandemic, our country of almost 10 million people had only 44 oxygen-ventilated beds and a doctor-to-patient ratio of roughly one to 20,000. This new institution is a structural readjustment that will help bridge that gap.” The new university, expected to be operational by 2030, will take over the functions managed under the University of PNG School of Medicine and Health Sciences. Higher Education, Research, Science, Technology and Sports Minister Kinoka Feo said PNG had 0.58 per cent health workers per 1,000 population, when compared with Fiji’s 2.23 per cent and Samoa’s 2.74 per cent. “We have 16 community health worker training schools, 15 nursing colleges and only two universities delivering medical officer training programmes,” Feo said. He said 30 per cent of skilled health workers occupied administrative roles rather than direct patient care. “Our capacity to train health staff has declined significantly over the last 24 years with newly qualified staff production well below workforce attrition rates,” he said. “Our maternal mortality ratio remains high at 171 per 100,000 lives births, which is among the highest in the Western Pacific region.” Meanwhile the infant mortality is 33 deaths per 1,000 live births and 40 per cent are approaching retirement age.

Bus and taxi fares up by 60 and 40 per cent respectively from Jan 1,https://www.thenational.com.pg/bus-and-taxi-fares-up-by-60-and-40-per-cent-respectively-from-jan-1/,31/10/2025,"BUS and taxi fares will go up by 60 per cent and 40 per cent respectively from Jan 1. This will increase the city route fares of PMVs from K1 and K2 to K1.60 and K2.60 respectively. The Independent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) said the main cause for the hike is the increase in fuel costs. It said bus fares will be implemented in phases, 20 per cent annually for the first three years of the five-year regulatory period. Likewise, increase in taxi fares will also be implemented in phases by 16 per cent, 14 per cent and 10 per cent for the first three years of the five-year regulatory period. In addition, to this upfront increase, fares will be subject to annual adjustments linked to changes in fuel prices and the Underlying Consumer Price Index (CPI). The ICCC has proposed that a 60 per cent weighting in the adjustment formula will be allocated to fuel reflecting its dominant share in operator costs, particularly PMVs, while the CPI component will represent 40 per cent of the adjusted fares, capturing broader cost drivers. Acting ICCC chief executive Officer Jack Timi said that PMVs and taxis were a vital component of PNG’s transportation system, particularly for people who do not own private cars. They fill a critical gap by providing accessible transport in urban and non-urban areas, connecting people to services and economic opportunities. “Most importantly, the draft report contains the proposed PMV and taxi fares that will be applied starting Jan 1,” he said. “Given its importance, the ICCC commenced a pricing review into the PMV and taxi industry earlier this year, calling for submissions from all stakeholders as part of the consultation process,” Timi said. He said the draft report contains ICCC’s preliminary findings and draft determinations for setting the PMV and taxi fares for the next regulatory period (2026-2030). Other key findings from the review are: Timi has urged all PMV and taxi owners, operators, PMV associations, commuters, Government agencies and the general public to provide their written comments and submissions on ICCC’s draft determinations. All the comments and submissions provided will help ICCC to complete the review process and release a final report before the end of this year, containing the final determinations.",Business,Sadness,Nill,The National

He added that some lawyers had gone into such practice to solicit money without the knowledge of the people they are meant to help. “This has happened in other districts as well so I will ask the department to investigate the matter,” he said. “I will come back to you on how we can straighten this issue once the investigation is complete.” Madang MP Bryan Kramer then asked a supplementary question, urging Niningi to also consider making amendments to the DDA Act to prevent such practices from happening again. “The only appropriate action that you can take is that you amend the DDA Act that says that lawyers cannot garnish DDA accounts, just like they cannot garnish the State. “Instead of the long process to investigate, you just make the amendments to address this issue,” Kramer said.

Alega, after signing all the ballot papers to himself, thanked the people of Rogoma and the potential candidates for putting their trust in him to be the ward member without a race. In a small gathering in the presence of the election and security officials, Alega said being declared unopposed among the rest of the 30 wards, was history for him, ward two and Kagua LLG. He said he was looking forward to working with the people at the community government in addressing their development needs. Owen Rombala, an elite of Rogoma, congratulated Alega as being the unopposed ward two member. Rombala said Alega will formally be declared at Kagua station later when all counting for Kagua LLG are completed. The one-person polling started at 8am and concluded at 9am.

Department urged to revoke 14 new wards,https://www.thenational.com.pg/department-urged-to-revoke-14-new-wards/,31/10/2025,"LEADERS behind the staging of protests against the local level government (LLG) polling in Jiwaka’s Anglimp South-Waghi have called on the Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs to revoke the 14 new wards. John Kumb, who is the chairman of the protesting committee, in a gathering of leaders at Anglimp on Wednesday, said the Tuesday’s event involving communities from Kudzip to Komun would not have happened if authorities would seriously look into the matter. Kumb said community leaders with their people in Anglimp LLG saw and felt that current leaders created the wards by hijacking processes. He said nine of the 14 wards are in Wara Tuman zone where local MP and Minister for Correctional Services Joe Kuli comes from while five are in Peng zone. “The population in Tuman zone is not bigger than Peng zone,” he said. The seven leaders from both Anglimp and Kuna Komun raised the same concern that for polling to proceed, the 14 new wards should be excluded and the 2022 electoral roll be used.

Five held over illegal roadblocks,https://www.thenational.com.pg/five-held-over-illegal-roadblocks/,31/10/2025,"POLICE arrested five persons from Jiwaka’s Anglimp-South Waghi for allegedly setting up multiple of illegal roadblocks along the Highlands Highway on Tuesday. Provincial police commander Chief Insp Laimo Asi, who with six of his officers were attacked by a mob in Kuli, confirmed that the five were arrested and were in police custody. Asi said those arrested would be charged under the Anti-Terrorism Act. He also called on Anglimp local level government president Nicholas Kurua to identify those suspects involved in attacking the police. Asi explained that the roadblocks set up by the people of Anglimp and Komun were illegal because no prior police clearance was sought. Also illegal was the protest in Banz on Monday, he said. Asi added that police were keeping a close watch on Anglimp-South Waghi, and police and other security reinforcements from within the Highlands would be called in to deal with any similar incidences. Meanwhile, local leaders from Anglimp and Komun, in a gathering on Wednesday, apologised to Asi and his officers. Senior councillor Elvis Lo said the community would formally apologise to Asi and his men for the injuries they sustained when attacked by youths at Kuli. Elvis Lo said there was a long-standing dispute between the police and the community since 2022, where police allegedly shot and killed four youths, and injured 28 others in an election-related issue. He said the matter, though being pursued by the police hierarchy, did not come out with any results.

Ape’s first-born son Hilary Aiwa said their father, who was working for the National Narcotics Bureau, was on his way to work when the incident happened. “We thank the PPC and his police officers for bringing in the suspects,” Hilary said. “They chained him and cut off his legs and threw him into a bag and hung it on a tree, something not worth describing.” “That act didn’t settle well with us but we want the law to take its cause. “We only want peace.” According to police, five suspects were arrested after they were notified through social media. Hilary said they had not received any support from Central leaders since the incident. “This shows how disrespectful these people are, and the family demands a good explanation from the community leaders, including the national leaders,” he said. “The vehicle had been in the village for days, and no one bothered to report it to the police until the police, after seeing aFacebookpost, went and recovered the vehicle.” The family in their petition are demanding Governor Rufina Peter and Hiri-Koiari MP Keith Iduhu to come forward and address the issue and the family on how they can repatriate Ape’s body to Jiwaka. They also demanded the vehicle be fixed and returned and K1 million from the suspects for the killing.

Authorities in ENB close four Asian shops,https://www.thenational.com.pg/authorities-in-enb-close-four-asian-shops/,31/10/2025,"FOUR shops operated by Asian business owners in East New Britain’s Kokopo have been ordered to close after inspections   revealed serious health and building hazards regarded a threat to customers and employees. The Kokopo-Vunamami urban local level government (KVULLG) condemned the premises after findings confirmed major building and health safety violations. The affected shops include NBI Supermarket, Talina Trading, Islands Supermarket and JJ Mart, all located along the Kokopo beachfront. According to Kokopo City manager Alkan Mararang, the decision was made after comprehensive environmental health inspections carried out by KVULLG environmental health officers. Inspections were conducted on March 11 for NBI Supermarket, Talina Trading, and Islands Supermarkets, and on Jan 9, for JJ Mart. “These defects pose serious risks to the public, occupants and workers,” Mararang said. “The environment was not conducive for occupation.” He said the action was taken in response to formal complaints from the East New Britain physical planning board, the building board, and the KVULLG Business Licensing Committee, which raised concerns about the deteriorating state of the buildings. The poor condition of the buildings created potential dangers such as fire, electrocution, structural collapse and the spread of infectious diseases. Mararang said notices were issued prior to the closure, but the tenants failed to take any action to improve the conditions. “They were given a grace period of three months to vacate, but they did not comply, so in June the buildings were closed permanently,” he said. However, Mararang confirmed that JJ Mart has since complied with KVULLG’s directives and is carrying out demolition and reconstruction to meet building safety and health standards. He added that as the responsible authority, KVULLG will uphold the decision to close the facilities. “We will work with the landlord to ensure the buildings are removed and proper facilities are constructed in accordance with the building board guidelines,” Mararang said. “We need to address this and get it sorted out.”",Business,Disgust,Nill,The National

Marape reaffirms Pukpuk Treaty,https://www.thenational.com.pg/marape-reaffirms-pukpuk-treaty/,31/10/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has reaffirmed that the recently- signed Papua New Guinea-Australia Mutual Defence Treaty, known as the Pukpuk Treaty, is a forward-looking sovereign decision by PNG to strengthen its national defence capacity and regional security posture while deepening the country’s historic relationship with Australia. Marape said this when responding to questions raised by Hiri-Koiari MP Keith Iduhu in Parliament yesterday. Iduhu questioned why the treaty was not tabled and debated in Parliament before it was signed and why there were no consultations. “Why the rush. Were there extreme circumstances where the people should be aware of?” he asked. “Is PNG under threat and are we going to war? Does it align more with Australian issues than PNG’s?” He also said how the treaty stabilised threats from within, given the ongoing tribal fights and other problems arising from the Connect PNG Programme. “There are also discussions about recruitment for permanent residents in Australia, it’s not for all Papua New Guineans. “Does that include the general upkeep of Goldie Barracks staff and trainees?” he asked. Iduhu said it seemed like the treaty changed PNG’s non-aligned foreign policy by legally obligating it to defend Australia as if they needed our help. Marape clarified that the treaty was initiated at PNG’s request, constructed within the bounds of the Constitution, and did not compromise Papua New Guinea’s sovereignty in any way. “As prime minister, I am the No.1 security officer of this country,” he said. “My foremost duty is to protect our people from external and internal threats. “This treaty was not imposed on us – we asked for it because it elevates the capacity of our Defence Force to stand alongside one of the region’s most capable and trusted defence partners.” Marape assured the House that the treaty fully complies with Section 206 of the PNG Constitution and the Visiting Forces Act of 1975, which provides the legal basis for Defence Cooperation with foreign forces. “Our founding fathers created those provisions knowing that as a young nation we would need to cooperate with trusted partners,” Marape explained. “This treaty sits firmly within that Constitutional framework. Once all checks by the state solicitor and relevant agencies are completed, it will come before Parliament for debate and ratification under Section 117 – as required by law.” Marape said the treaty represents the culmination of nearly five decades of Defence Cooperation between the two nations, beginning with the Status of Forces Agreement (1977) and later the Defence Cooperation Agreement (2013). The Pukpuk Treaty now lifts that relationship to the highest level – a mutual defence treaty that ensures shared responsibility for Regional Peace and Security. He emphasised that PNG must build a modern, well-resourced Defence Force capable of safeguarding its 10 million-plus persons, 462,840 square kilometres of land, and more than three million square kilometres of maritime and airspace. “Our nation is not small,” Marape said. “We have a vast ocean, a long border, and a growing population. “Over the next 10 years, we will systematically grow our PNG Defence Force to 7,000 men and women in uniform and 3,000 reservists. “With the treaty, we also create pathways for up to 10,000 Papua New Guineans to train and serve within the Australian Defence Force, building skills that will return home to strengthen our own capacity.” The treaty will enhance PNG’s Defence capability across land, air, and sea domains, including maritime surveillance, air mobility, technology transfer, and joint training. “This partnership does not erode our sovereignty – it strengthens it,” Marape said. “Our Defence Force will always report to the commander of the PNG Defence Force. “Australians and Papua New Guineans serving under the Australian Defence Force, will report to their own commander. “We train and operate side-by-side, but sovereignty is never compromised.” Marape said the treaty acknowledges PNG’s right to maintain defence relationships with other nations and is guided by the principles of non-alignment, transparency, and accountability. “No bilateral partner has raised any objection,” Marape noted. “Every mature nation recognises the sovereign right of independent states to choose partners they trust. “Geography and history bind us to Australia – we share a neighbourhood and a destiny.” Marape described the treaty as a strategic investment in national security for future generations, enabling PNG to respond effectively to modern challenges including border incursions, transnational crime, illegal fishing, terrorism, and natural disasters. “The Pukpuk Treaty is not about geopolitics – it’s about securing our home,” Marape said. “Just as Israel’s long-term alliance with the United States has ensured its survival and strength, Papua New Guinea’s partnership with Australia will anchor our stability and growth for decades to come.” He also confirmed that the Government’s broader security agenda will include rebuilding the Police Force, Correctional Services, and national law and justice institutions, so that “our entire security sector rises together”. Marape paid tribute to Australia as PNG’s “foundational partner,” noting that the relationship is rooted in shared values of democracy, faith, and mutual respect. “From the womb of Australia, we were birthed into our sovereign nationhood in 1975,” Marape reflected. “Fifty years on, Australia has never abandoned us. “This treaty reaffirms that enduring bond – not as subservient partners, but as equals standing side-by-side, protecting our common home.” Marape concluded by reaffirming his commitment to national unity, constitutional process, and the vision of a self-reliant PNG. “The Pukpuk Treaty is a tree we plant today whose shade future generations will enjoy,” Marape said. “It ensures that our children and their children will inherit a safer, stronger, and more secure PNG – confident in its sovereignty and proud of its partnerships.”",Politics,Trust,"James Marape, Keith Iduhu",The National

Prime Minister James Marape, when tabling the CRLRC’s two-volume report in Parliament yesterday, said that the seven recommendations were now up for debate to allow for changes to legislations, including the Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Governments and the Constitution. The recommendations in the report titled:“Review of the Form and System of Government”are: The CLRC’s terms of reference which guided the review were summarised as: Of the seven recommendations, the second was made by the CLRC as it found that people did not fully understand the powers and functions of the King as the Head of State. “The commission recommends that the Kind of England be removed as the Head of State and replaced with a Papua New Guinean,” the report stated. “From the consultations, it is clear that most people have not fully understood the powers and functions of the King as the Head of State. “They did not understand that the King as the Head of State is merely a rubberstamp and has no real power. “Further, they did not understand that removing the King as the Head of State will affect PNG’s membership with the commonwealth of nations.” Marape commended the CLRC’s report, saying that it was part of the work of the Government to review the system as part of the 50-year reforms to strengthen the parliamentary, public service and government processes and mechanisms of the country. “This is a well-researched report that demonstrates the extent CLRC has gone to ensure that every opportunity was given for all to participate and contribute their views in the review,” he said. “As a Government, we must not be scared of change, however daunting it may be, especially changes that are necessary for our progress and our future prosperity. “Given the country’s experience in the 2011 political impasse and the corrupt practices of the leaders and bureaucrats, the Head of State needs to be empowered to intervene and that is only possible if the King of England is remove and replaced with a Papua New Guinean. “By removing the Kind as the Head of State and replacing him with someone who will exercise real powers, the country will be satisfied that it is maintaining an office that is established for the good governance of this country. “Symbolically, it will affirm PNG as a truly independent sovereign State resolving any ongoing claims of neo-colonialism being exercised in PNG “Real powers will be vested in the Head of State who would play a figurehead role over the State in terms of governance.”",Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,The National
"No bulk fee payment, says UPNG’s Finlay",https://www.thenational.com.pg/no-bulk-fee-payment-says-upngs-finlay/,30/10/2025,"THE University of Papua New Guinea is willing to return K343,500 to the Eastern Highlands provincial government so it can distribute to students who will now pay individually. Vice-Chancellor Prof Ian Findlay said that the bulk payment by the provincial government had resulted in mishap involving students from the Eastern Highland as reported in the media recently. Findlay said in a statement that UPNG had changed its policy relating to bulk payments and had reverted to students settling their tuition fees individually. Findlay said the policy was necessary because UPNG had more than 7,000 students registered annually in its five schools, as well as a growing number of Open Learning Colleges. Said Findlay: “It is extremely difficult and time consuming to reconcile student accounts with the many types of sponsorship payments, especially when sponsors make bulk payments which don’t identify which students are being sponsored. “This causes substantial delay and disappointment for students.” In January 2023, UPNG published a circular in newspapers informing every one of the new policy. Instead of bulk sponsorship payments that don’t identify students, the public and sponsors were directed that: Findlay said: “The vast majority of sponsors complied.

HIV infection rate high in women: UNAIDS official,https://www.thenational.com.pg/hiv-infection-rate-high-in-women-unaids-official/,30/10/2025,"OUT of the estimated 120,000 reported cases of people living with HIV/AIDS in the country, the majority (60 per cent) are women, says UNAIDS country office adviser, Mosende Zimmbodilion. Speaking at the PNG Christian Leaders Media conference in Port Moresby yesterday, Zimmbodilion said nearly half of these women and girls were exchanging sex for money, transport, goods or just to be able to continue their studies. “From our studies some are selling their bodies to male clients to be able to put food on the table for their children and support their families,” Zimmbodilion said. He highlighted that the other half of these women were not sex workers and many of them had no idea how they got infected. “We have no idea why women who were not sex workers were infected. We are guessing that those women and girls’ husbands are clients of female sex workers or their husbands who have sex with other men who also have wives,” he said. Zimmbodilion said from their surveillance, they had determined that three out of 10 or one out of three of married men were also having sex with other men. “But we have no idea what’s the magnitude and that’s why hopefully we can have more surveillance done and identify the root causes why our adult females are getting infected,” he said. Meanwhile, he highlighted that the majority of transmissions of HIV/AIDS virus were sexually transmitted either by male to female, female to male and even male to male. “There is also a significant proportion of transmission from pregnant mothers to their children who are not on treatment,” he said. Meanwhile, he raised concerns that 20 per cent of people living with HIV/AIDS were aware of their status but were not going to the hospital for further test and treatment. “We need to ask, why 20 per cent of infected people even though they know their HIV status and also the availability of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) drug in nearly 200 clinics in the country, and in almost all districts of the country. “Why are they not taking ART? It’s free, and funded by the government,” he said. He urged everyone to go for HIV/AIDS testing and if they are positive, they would be put on treatment which is free and this can stop the virus from transmitting to their partners. “We have proof that once you are on ART treatment, your viral load can no longer transmit the virus to your partner or baby.”",Health,Sadness,Nill,The National
Morobe roads damaged by alluvial mining activities,https://www.thenational.com.pg/morobe-roads-damaged-by-alluvial-mining-activities/,30/10/2025,"WORKS and Highways Minister, Solan Mirisim, is appealing for responsible alluvial mining practices in Wau-Waria and Bulolo areas to avoid sections of the roads being washed out. Mirisim made the appeal, clarifying that the alluvial mining activities along the Bulolo and Watut Rivers, had contributed to siltation, river diversions, and road and bridge embankment erosion that severely undermined the highway, bridge, and drainage crossings. He stated that the department was doing several minor emergency works worth K5 million to repair washed-out sections caused by severe alluvial mining activities. “While the department continues to maintain and upgrade the highway, I appeal to the Bulolo and Wau-Waria MPs, including the Morobe administration, district development authorities, Mineral Resource Authority (MRA) and Kumul Mineral Holdings Ltd to manage and control alluvial mining activities,” Mirisim said. “Control these activities undertaken by the locals and contractors, especially in areas such as Sambio and Pine Tops, where heavy dredging operations are directly damaging the national road infrastructure. “These recurrent road failures are largely man-made disasters, and district level management and enforcement of environment and mining regulations are critical to protecting public infrastructure investments worth millions of Kina,” Mirisim said. He further said that the Government remained fully committed to upgrading and maintaining all strategic national highways, including the Trans-National Highway corridor, as part of the Connect PNG Programme to ensure safe, reliable, and climate-resilient connectivity across the country. He said the department had secured a loan from the Asian Development Bank and the design work between Nentino to Bulolo was in its final stages. He said the Bulolo to Lae was designed under the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific programme, and design works for Kumalu crossing were fully funded. Funding has been sought from development partners to construct a permanent crossing option. “We are committed to fully rebuilding this important national highway to a class one road.’’",Infrastructure,Anger,Solan Mirisim,The National
Biometric system to be implemented carefully: Sinai,https://www.thenational.com.pg/biometric-system-to-be-implemented-carefully-sinai/,30/10/2025,"PAPUA New Guinea Electoral Commissioner Simon Sinai says a biometric system of voting must be implemented through a cautious and phased approach by 2027. “We are committed to innovation and have already piloted technology-based voter registration methods such as photo-roll registration in several locations,” he said. “However, the time and resources available are not adequate to implement full biometric registration, voting and counting by 2027. “Rushing this process carries significant risk and could divert critical funding and attention away from other essential preparations needed for a credible and orderly election.” Sinai said the commission’s photo-roll project had been successfully implemented in New Ireland, East Sepik and Central in previous years, and more recently, the Motu-Koita Assembly elections held in the National Capital District. He said such technology, including that of a biometric system, must not compromise the integrity of the electoral process, calling on all voters and stakeholders to work together to improving election outcomes in the country. “In line with the global trends and regional developments, the Electoral Commission acknowledges the potential of technology to strengthen electoral integrity. “Change is imminent and the Electoral Commission is prepared to to accept and adopt to new innovations and technology by embarking on a system voter identification and enrolment,” Sinai said. “While challenges remain in improving elections and addressing voter concerns, the Electoral Commission is committed to ensuring the successful outcome.”",Politics,Anticipation,Nill,The National

The Nationalhas reached out to a few concerned citizens regarding the issue of people being rejected from the polling booth due to their names not being on the roll. Lae Urban’s ward two presiding officer, Timothy Holingu, said that it was heartbreaking to see people who had grown up together in the same street were sent away. “These people have lived in the area for more than 15 to 20 years,” Holingu said. “They were told ‘no names, no vote’. “I managed to explain properly to them that the error was not conducted by the polling officials, and they are not to be blamed.” He said about 20 voters were sent away. “This error was not supposed to happen because these people have the right to vote,” Holingu said. “We don’t know if the error happened because the common roll was updated or not, but these people were eligible to cast a vote in the 2022 National General Election, but for the LLG elections, their names are not on the list.” The same sentiment was shared by the presiding officer of Bulolo-Urban’s ward three, Kallang Muting. He said polling had been conducted well but the roll update was causing hindrance to the flow of polling as people had been resident for more than 15 years. “But their names are not on the common roll,” he said. “Prior awareness needs to be done before polling starts to ensure everyone is informed of the polling dates and schedule.” The Nationalwas also advised that the same issue happened in Finschhafen and Markham, where a handful of voters were turned away.",Politics,Sadness,Nill,The National

The department has reduced the scope of work, the 45km section from Lae to Timini Bridge is funded under the AIFFP for K66 million. Miirism said 27km has been sealed to a high standard, and 18km remained to be completed once loan variations are approved by AIFFP. “The project is progressing well under the supervision of the Works and Highways Department and the contractor remains mobilised,” he said. From Timini Bridge to Bangulum Bridge is 33km, which is funded under the Connect programme worth K38 million. Sealing work has started at Timini village and the contractor is working on the site, making steady progress towards Bangulum. From Bangulum Bridge to Pine Top Bridge is another 33km, and the procurement has been completed, and work is starting under Connect PNG phase one budget of K55 million. “Several minor emergency jobs worth K5 million are being undertaken to repair washed out sections caused by severe alluvial mining activities along the Bulolo and Watut Rivers,” Mirisim said. “This government is addressing legacy issues and the Wau-Bulolo Highway is one of those legacy issues that has been neglected by successive governments. We are addressing it at the moment.” Mirisim responded to a petition by Bulolo MP Sam Basil Jr, who raised concern regarding the state of the highway, stating that it has disintegrated into a bush track and is much worse than when funding was provided.

Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Immigration, John Rosso, yesterday said that the 105 expatriates are mainly of Chinese origin. Majority of those that were arrested have been processed and placed in police custody at the Lae Central police station before being transported to Nadzab’s Tomodachi International Airport and put on a flight yesterday morning to Port Moresby. “Many of them were found to have breached their visa conditions under the PNG Migration Act and were allegedly working in the alluvial mining sector,” said Rosso. He also said that these 105 expatriates will be processed and assessed carefully and if other PNG laws are seen to have been breached, then they will be charged and fined by the courts depending on which laws they breached. “I am continuing to take a hardline stance on such and foreign nationals in the country should by all means abide by the laws of this country at all costs,” Rosso said. “And if they are found to have breached any law(s) of this country through the courts, they will be fined and deported forthwith.” Rosso further urged all foreigners who are doing business or are on tourist visas in the country to respect the laws governing this country and must abide by these laws at all times to avoid inconveniences during their stay in the country. Chief Migration Officer Wellington Navasivu said the individuals arrived in Port Moresby at mid-day yesterday and will be held in immigration detention awaiting administrative removal from the country. He also said the 105 were apprehended at five illegal mining sites along the Sambio River, Wau Waria. The suspects were found to be in breach of several provisions under the Migration Act and the Employment of Non-Citizens Act. The breach includes working at unauthorised locations, absence of valid work permit documentation, engagement in employment inconsistent with visa conditions and providing false information to immigration officers. Navasivu said the suspects were flown to Port Moresby today and will be held in detention until all administrative processes are completed and they will be removed from the country. “We will ensure the individuals are placed on alert and will not return,” Navasivu gave his assurance. “The company and their sponsors who brought them into the country will be held responsible and necessary administrative and compliance charges will apply”.

The patients were discharged on Friday because Angau’s sterilisation unit was down, affecting surgeries at the theatre. They were told that there were no drugs and consumables, or basic linens to perform surgery. One of the patients admitted with ovarian cyst toldThe Nationalthat she was taken off solid food in preparation for her operation and her families were called in to donate blood. “I went in to Angau with very high hopes but my hopes crashed when we were discharged without a positive response,” she said. The 60-year-old single mother said she started feeling ill in September. She tried a private hospital first but the total costs was K800 and increasing to more than K1,000. She went to Angau where she was admitted at a general ward and then transferred to the gynaecology and obstetrics ward this month to await surgery to remove the cyst. “I was taken off solids and put on Panadol and drip only in preparation for surgery,” she said. “I had five family members come in to donate blood. “I was happy and mentally prepared to get this over with. “Unfortunately, my happiness was not long-lived. “We were told that the machines are spoilt, lights are off, no oxygen, no tubes, no linens, no threads and needles. “When we asked for a referral so we could check other hospitals, they said no and they did not give any reasons why. “When I enquired about the blood donations under my name, they said blood could only stay fresh for up to a week so they could not do much. “You go home and come back on your review date next month and we’ll figure something out. “I was then given Panadol and discharged, now I’m awaiting my review. “This is not the service average Papua New Guineans should receive anywhere in the country – from the way the doctors speak to the patients to the availability of resources – people’s health is a sensitive and stressful issue that must tread with care.” Morobe health authority chief executive officer Dr Kipas Binga said funding was the main bottleneck among reasons for issues at the hospital, including the restoration of sterilisation services. Binga said Angau has a sophisticated sterilisation unit which could only be maintained by technical expertise from Australia. He said this was the second time the unit had gone down, unfortunately, the help cannot be accessed immediately as there was no money. “We’ve communicated with people in Australia and they gave us the cost, but we could not pay because the money for operational   funding is not coming in,” he said, “We are back by three or four months to get our CFCs – we got 50 per cent of our appropriation for this year. “We just received last month’s CFC and we are very grateful; we hope to get one for this month and next month so we can to carry out operations. “That’s a reason why we cannot pay directly for some of the costs to bring service in.” Binga said after redevelopment, Angau was given a budget of K8 million for normal maintenance of the new facility. “This was factored into our recurrent budgets over the years but the reality is that budget appropriation is one thing while getting the actual funds depends,” he said. Binga said Angau has been sending equipment to Goroka General Hospital for sterilisation. He said in the meantime, a technical team from Port Moresby was brought in to set up sterilisation units at Tent City and West Taraka clinics, as well as Bulolo and Mutzing District Hospital. “Management is now seriously looking at purchasing or procuring one sterilisation unit that is user-friendly,” he said.",Health,Sadness,Nill,The National

Marape slams O’Neill: He is misguided,https://www.thenational.com.pg/marape-slams-oneill-he-is-misguided/,29/10/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has hit back at his predecessor Peter O’Neill, describing the latter’s attacks on his government as “misguided and selective”. He said that O’Neill’s criticism of his government’s performance was akin to the “pot calling the kettle black” – someone criticising another for a fault they share. Said Marape: “We picked up the country he destroyed, and now we are putting it back on a path of growth. It was a K79 billion economy when we took office in 2019. Despite global crisis and giving so much tax relief to businesses and workers, our economy has grown to over K130 billion – adding more than K50 billion in such tough times.” He said that the Government’s prudent management and policy interventions had restored investor confidence, unlocked stalled projects, and positioned PNG as a stronger, more resilient economy. “Ask ADB, IMF, World Bank, Westpac, ANZ, BSP, the Central Bank or even our own superfunds like Nasfund and Nambawan Super. “They will all confirm that our economy today is far improved compared to the declining days from 2014 to 2018 when our economy was in recession,” Marape said. Marape pointed out that under his leadership, resource projects such as Porgera, Papua LNG, P’nyang, Pasca A and Wafi-Golpu had been renegotiated to secure a fairer share of benefits for the State and landowners. “Unlike in the past, where major resource projects were signed with minimal returns to our people, this Government has made it mandatory that Papua New Guinea gets better equity, better local content, and better long-term value,” he said. He said that the projects, valued at more than K300 billion in total investment, would create jobs, boost exports, and strengthen foreign reserves. The Government has also delivered key reforms and infrastructure investments that benefit the people, including tuition-free education fully restored, with budget allocations for secondary and tertiary education. In health, Marape said that new district hospitals and community health posts had been built or upgraded in more than 50 districts, including the East Sepik Provincial Hospital, Enga Provincial Hospital, Boram Hospital, Mendi Provincial Hospital, and major upgrades at the Port Moresby General Hospital. On law and order, Marape said that there was increased funding for the police, judiciary and Correctional Services, plus new police housing programme and the strengthening of the Independent Commission Against Corruption and judiciary infrastructure. He also pointed out that more than 6,000 kilometres of roads were rehabilitated or constructed since 2019. There is also continued investment in Connect PNG and national energy grid projects, plus port upgrades in Lae, Port Moresby and other regional centres.

He made specific reference to the levies in trust for the past six years amounting to K30 million. “Can the people of Milne Bay and Northern (Oro) province be informed on the oil palm that was paid for in cash by the New Britain Palm Oil Limited (NBPOL) in 2010?” Morris asked. “We want a report on this because the shares earned have been in trust by the State in the last 15 years. “We acknowledge the Government has released K10 million on each of those dividend shares, but respectively these funds have been held by the State for the last 15 years,” he said. The Non-Tax Revenue Administration (NTRA) Act 2022 instructs that all non-tax revenue collected by government statutory bodies and authorities must be remitted to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). This Act replaced the Public Money Management Regularisation (PMMR) Act and aims to improve the management of these funds to support the national budget. Prime Minister James Marape said “the review is not out of reach and “we can make amends to see the mechanics of the NTRA that it must work well without killing the goose that lays the egg”. “Statutory bodies must submit their budget proposals for the following year, and the funds are then allocated back to them for reasonable operating requirements, according to the NTRA Act,” Marape said. “The ration of NTRA was such that many of the boards for statutory bodies to its sectors, were not open for public scrutiny except through Cabinet, so the work plan comes from Cabinet and upon minister’s submission of annual reports to parliament. “But we have observed over time that this backdates into possibly two governments up till the Pangu administration and will require a review. “There is a teething issue and the administration of NTRA might not be fully intended for what it stands for but I want to give assurance and we will certainly look into this,” he said.",Business,Anticipation,"James Marape, Ricky Morris",The National

Groups took to Highlands Highway yesterday morning to air their grievances and harrassed the commuting public travelling the higway. Electoral Commissioner (EC) Simon Sinai later announced the suspension of polling for the two LLGs). He said he made the decision based on security and integrity of the polling officials and electoral processes, while calling on the Provincial and Level Government Department to investigate the creation of the two LLGs. EC’s decision was compliant to the people’s demand petitioned to Sinai last week, wanting the 14 new wards in Anglimp Rural and Kuna Komun not to go into the polls this week. Locals alleged that the creation of the new wards was illegal and did not comply with the due processes, Sinai said. “Security is entirely lacking and the situation is escalating out of control.” A letter to the Minister was copied to the chief secretary, Provincial and Local Level Department secretary, provincial administrator Rick Kogen, police commander Chief Inspector Laimo Asi, and Anglimp LLG president Nickolas Kurua. All vehicles from Upper Highlands and Chimbu were turned back from roadblocks staged from Kudjip, Kindeng and Komun sections of the highway. It started on Monday with a peaceful protest in Banz which was addressed by the election manager Rossie Pundihau but in yesterday’s roadblocks, demands were made of Sinai to respond to a petition within 24 hours.

She said polling in Minj, Jimi, and North Waghi which are on schedule for this week are affected by the protests in Kudjip and Anglimp LLGs. Yesterday morning thepeople blocked sections of highway with logs and heavy materials, cutting off transportation access.

Names not on roll: Candidate,https://www.thenational.com.pg/names-not-on-roll-candidate/,29/10/2025,"AN intending candidate for the Pomio’s West Pomio local level government (LLG) president seat in East New Britain has raised concerns over the failure of the Electoral Office to register eligible voters on the common roll. John Leo, a candidate for the West-Pomio LLG president seat, raised this concern yesterday (Tuesday) in Pomio. According to Leo, many voters in West Pomio LLG were denied the right to vote on the first day of polling after being told their names were not on the roll. Similar issues occurred during the 2022 general election, causing frustration among residents. “The law has deprived voters of their right to vote again, including myself,” he said. Despite efforts by residents to register their names at the ward and LLG levels, the common roll had not been updated, hindering the voting process. Other parts of the province have also reported missing names on the roll on the first day of polling. Leo emphasised that voters had done their part, but the Electoral Office had failed to update the common roll. “We have done our part, this is not our fault,” he said. The issue raises doubt with the country’s readiness to have elections and legitimacy of outcome. “People are not voting because their names are not on the common roll. Who is failing the voters? People sitting in that office should be committed to addressing election issues,” he said. Leo highlighted a previous recommendation that a supplementary roll be used in situations like this. The supplementary roll allows those whose names are missing from the common roll to vote. “The supplementary roll is more accurate because people are recorded by where they reside. This makes it easier and convenient for voters who would otherwise miss out,” he said.",Politics,Anger,Nill,The National

Voivoi explained that as per schedule, ENB started polling on Monday and should conclude by Friday. There are total of 137 polling teams in the province. Voivoi also urged ward recorders to be present when polling is being conducted in their wards. “The ward recorders must be there when polling is done, so that they can identify the people (voters) who say their names are not on the ward roll,” he said. “This is because we have had instances where people come in from other places claiming to be from that ward.” Voivoi confirmed that the last ward roll update in the province was done in 2024 but so far, on the first day of the polling around the province, a number of people had been turned away due to them having no names on the ward roll. Voivoi further advised that counting for the ward member seats, have begun in some wards after the close of polling with names of winning candidates announced at the ward. “However, those winning candidates can only be declared by the ENB Provincial Returning Officer (PRO) Theresa Sam. This will be done after all the polling and counting are completed, including that of the local level government (LLG) president seats in all the 23 LLGs,” Voivoi said.

Yafai, through his lawyer Edward Sasingian, filed the Supreme Court application without leave, to review the decision of Sir Gibbs Salika made on Aug 19, which convicted him on four counts of misappropriation and one count of abuse of office. Yafai was convicted and sentenced for misappropriating K41.8 million of public funds. He argued among other grounds that Sir Gibbs had erred in law and fact when he had him convicted and has sought orders to uphold the appeal, and have the whole of the judgment of Aug 19 quashed. He is arguing that Sir Gibbs had made an error of convicting him on the finding that he was directed by the secretary for Finance Steven Gibson (late) to verify the claim by Paul Paraka and that when he failed to do so, he was acting dishonestly, when the evidence before the court said otherwise. On another ground of appeal, Yafai argued that Sir Gibbs erred in mixed fact and law, when he accepted the evidence of the former Minister for Finance James Marape that was given against him in court, when it was unreliable and contradicted State exhibit, indicating bias. He further claims that the trial judge erred in law and fact in convicting him on abuse of office, for directing the payment of K41.8 million to Paraka Lawyers when the evidence before the court did not support the element. These and other grounds of appeal will be submitted before the higher court when the matter is listed for directions and allocation of hearing date.

Efforts to stamp out violence ‘failing’,https://www.thenational.com.pg/efforts-to-stamp-out-violence-failing/,29/10/2025,"NATIONAL Capital District (NCD) Governor Powes Parkop, who is also chairman of the Permanent Parliamentary Committee on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment, says the fight against Gender-based Violence is failing because government agencies have not taken ownership of the response strategy. Parkop made this known during a senior government officials meeting in Port Moresby yesterday to mobilise action against GBV. He noted the persistent high prevalence of violence was a major impediment to achieving national progress. Parkop pinpointed the solution, a mandated policy enforcement across all State entities. “The government itself is not taking ownership and responsibility for the response strategy to GBV and that is why it is failing,” he said. “We are not showing leadership. We are not taking ownership. We are not walking the talk.” Parkop issued a stern challenge to all State institutions to implement immediate action. “I want to see in the city all the government departments, State agencies and State-owned enterprises taking ownership of the strategy, and implementing it at workplaces, in homes and in communities,” he said. “Make it the terms and condition of employment of all the State employees.” Parkop said NCD Commission was already implementing zero tolerance as a term and condition of employment, and this mandate must be extended nationwide. The meeting, which was hosted by Personnel Management Department secretary Taies Sansan, serves as a preparation platform for the upcoming 20 Days of Activism against GBV and the NCD “Redvember” campaign. The nation’s alarming GBV statistics, which continue to rise despite decades of activism, were front and centre in the discussions. Sansan stressed that combating violence was not merely a women’s issue but a shared human responsibility. She focused her call to action directly on the nation’s bureaucracy, urging public servants to lead the change. “Ending violence is everyone’s responsibility,” Sansan said. “It is not just a women’s issue. “It is a human being issue both male and female.”",Politics,Anger,Powes Parkop,The National

US claims ceasefire holding as Israel strikes Gaza,https://www.thenational.com.pg/us-claims-ceasefire-holding-as-israel-strikes-gaza/,29/10/2025,"Jerusalem/Cairo: Israeli planes have launched deadly strikes in Gaza after Israel accused the militant group Hamas of violating a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, the latest test of a fragile deal brokered earlier this month by US President Donald Trump. Local health authorities said the strikes killed at least 26 people, including five in a house hit in the Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip, four in a building in Gaza City’s Sabra neighbourhood, and five in a car in Khan Younis. The attacks by Israeli planes continued into early Wednesday across the Gaza Strip, according to witnesses. The latest violence in the three-week-old ceasefire followed a statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office saying he had ordered immediate “powerful attacks.” The statement did not give a specific reason for the attacks but an Israeli military official said Hamas had violated the ceasefire by carrying out an attack against Israeli forces in an area of the enclave that is under Israeli control. The US-backed ceasefire agreement went into effect on Oct 10, halting two years of war triggered by deadly Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct 7, 2023. US Vice President JD Vance said that despite the latest flare-up, “the ceasefire is holding.” “That doesn’t mean that there aren’t going to be little skirmishes here and there,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill. “We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an (Israeli) soldier. We expect the Israelis are going to respond, but I think the president’s peace is going to hold despite that.” Hamas denied responsibility for an attack on Israeli forces in Rafah. The group also said in a statement that it remained committed to the ceasefire deal in Gaza. Tuesday’s strikes on Gaza City followed what Israel called a “targeted strike” on Saturday on a person in central Gaza who it said was planning to attack Israeli troops. Netanyahu said earlier on Tuesday that Hamas had violated the ceasefire by turning over some wrong remains in a process of returning the bodies of hostages to Israel. Netanyahu said the remains handed over on Monday belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, an Israeli killed during Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack. Tzarfati’s remains had already been partially retrieved by Israeli troops during the war. In response, Hamas initially said it would hand over to Israel the body of a missing hostage found in a tunnel in Gaza. However, Hamas’ armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said later it would postpone the handover, citing what it said were Israel’s violations of the ceasefire. Late on Tuesday, Al-Qassam issued a statement saying it had recovered the bodies of two Israeli hostages, Amiram Cooper and Sahar Baruch, during search operations in Gaza.. Hamas has said it will take time to locate and retrieve all the hostage remains amid Gaza’s ruins. The issue has become one of the main sticking points in the ceasefire, which Trump says he is watching closely. He has touted the truce and hostage-prisoner exchange deal as one of the top foreign policy achievements of his second term, and he and his top aides have sought to keep the ceasefire intact.

Huge raid on Rio gang leaves at least 60 people dead,https://www.thenational.com.pg/huge-raid-on-rio-gang-leaves-at-least-60-people-dead/,29/10/2025,"Rio De Janeiro: About 2,500 Brazilian police and soldiers have been involved in a massive raid on a drug-trafficking gang in Rio de Janeiro, arresting 81 suspects and sparking shootouts that left at least 60 suspects dead, officials said. The operation included officers in helicopters and armoured vehicles and targeted the notorious Red Command in the sprawling low-income favelas of Complexo de Alemao and Penha, police said. The police operation was one of the most violent in Brazil’s recent history, with at least one human rights organisation calling for an investigation into each death. Rio’s state Governor Claudio Castro said in a video posted on social platform X that 60 criminal suspects were “neutralised,” 81 arrested and 75 rifles seized during the one-day raid that he called the biggest such operation in the city’s history. An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies of at least two police officers among 10 bodies brought to the Getulio Vargas hospital in Penha. Police did not immediately confirm the deaths of officers. César Muñoz, director of Human Rights Watch in Brazil, called Tuesday’s events “a huge tragedy” and a “disaster.” “The public prosecutor’s office must open its own investigations and clarify the circumstances of each death,” Muñoz said in a statement. Footage on social media showed fire and smoke rising from the two favelas as gunfire rang out. The city’s Education Department said 46 schools across the two neighbourhoods were closed, and the nearby Federal University of Rio de Janeiro cancelled night classes and told people on campus to seek shelter. Suspected gang members blocked roads in northern and southeastern Rio in response to the raid, local media reported. At least 70 buses were commandeered to be used in the blockades, causing “significant damage,” the city’s bus organisation Rio Onibus said. Governor Castro, from the conservative opposition Liberal Party, said the federal government should be providing more support to combat crime — a swipe at the administration of leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Gleisi Hoffmann, the Lula administration’s liaison with the parliament, agreed that coordinated action was needed but pointed to a recent crackdown on money laundering as an example of the federal government’s action on organised crime. Rio has been the scene of lethal police raids for decades. In March 2005, some 29 people were killed in Rio’s Baixada Fluminense region, while in May 2021, 28 were killed in the Jacarezinho favela. Sociologist and public safety expert Luis Flavio Sapori argues these kinds of operations are inefficient because they don’t tend to catch the masterminds, but rather target underlings who can later be replaced. “It’s not enough to go in, exchange gunfire, and leave. There’s a lack of strategy in Rio de Janeiro’s public security policy,” Sapori said. “Some lower-ranking members of these factions are killed, but those individuals are quickly replaced by others.” The Marielle Franco Institute, a nonprofit founded by the slain councilwoman ‘s family to continue her legacy of fighting for the rights of people living in favelas, also criticised the operation. “This is not a public safety policy. It’s a policy of extermination, that makes the everyday life of Black and poor people a Russian roulette,” it said in a statement. Source: AP",Crime,Sadness,Nill,The National
Twisted games: young girls targeted by online gangs,https://www.thenational.com.pg/twisted-games-young-girls-targeted-by-online-gangs/,29/10/2025,"Canberra: Young girls are being hunted by young men online who are coercing their vulnerable victims into carrying out “twisted” acts of violence, the new head of the federal police warns. In an address to the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday, Krissy Barrett will announce three domestic arrests and 59 alleged offenders identified as members of decentralised online crime networks. “In this new, twisted type of gamification, perpetrators reach a new status or new level in their group when they provide more content showing more extreme acts of depravity and sadism,” she will say. “These crimes are now spilling into the real world and have real-world consequences.” The creation of a new taskforce will crack down on these networks and “crime-influencer” perpetrators. Young people have been reached on platforms including Roblox and messaging apps such as Telegram. The girls tended to have low-self esteem, mental health issues and a history of self-harm, Barrett will say. Previously serving as the agency’s deputy commissioner with oversight of national security, Barrett will point to growing strategic competition being exploited by state and non-state actors. Standing alongside Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the media conference announcing her promotion, the chief said a focus of her tenure would be ensuring the federal police had a healthy workforce.

"Melissa hits Jamaica with full force, on path to Cuba",https://www.thenational.com.pg/melissa-hits-jamaica-with-full-force-on-path-to-cuba/,29/10/2025,"Kingston: Heavy floodwaters swept across southwestern Jamaica, winds tore roofs off buildings and boulders tumbled onto roads as Hurricane Melissa came ashore as a catastrophic category five storm, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record. Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were reported as Melissa hit with 295 km/h winds near New Hope, with officials cautioning that the cleanup and damage assessment could be slow. “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,” Prime Minister Andrew Holness said. “The question now is the speed of recovery. That’s the challenge.” Floodwaters trapped at least three families in their homes in the community of Black River in western Jamaica, and crews were unable to help them because of dangerous conditions, said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica’s Disaster Risk Management Council. He noted that extensive damage was reported in the southwestern parish of St. Elizabeth, which he said “is underwater.” McKenzie said it was too early to talk about the extent of the damage because the hurricane — the strongest to hit the island since recordkeeping began 174 years ago — was still pummelling the country. It has since weakened slightly, to a still destructive category four system. The country’s Meteorological Service, warned that as Melissa moves off the coast its counterclockwise rotation will bring a heavy storm surge to northern Jamaica through the night. The storm is headed toward Cuba, where it’s expected to make landfall as a major hurricane early on Wednesday. Source: AP",Natural Disasters,Fear,Nill,The National
Democracy dips as Australia slips in global law ranking,https://www.thenational.com.pg/democracy-dips-as-australia-slips-in-global-law-ranking/,29/10/2025,"Canberra: Australia has slipped in a global rule of law ranking due to a decline in checks and balances, judicial limits on government power and justice being free from improper interference. It ranked 11th out of 143 nations, decreasing two ranks on the World Justice Project’s 2025 rule of law index, which was released on Tuesday. Australia’s score has slowly decreased since 2015, before bouncing back slightly in 2023. The project rates nations against benchmarks including constraints on government power, corruption, fundamental rights, order and security, civil and criminal justice and the enforcement of regulation. Freedom of assembly, freedom of opinion and expression and civic participation remained strong in Australia. New Zealand topped the East Asia and Pacific regional rankings – followed by Australia and Japan – and notched 5th overall. Although Pacific island nations aren’t included in this grouping. Eight out of 15 countries in the region went backwards in the last year, half of which also slipped the previous year. Denmark topped the list, followed by Norway, Finland and Sweden. Venezuela ranked the lowest, with Afghanistan and Cambodia rounding out the bottom three. There has been a global decline of the rule of law, with more than two-thirds of countries dropping down the rankings, compared to 57 per cent the previous year. Risks to democracy were spurred by an expansion of authoritarian trends, including the judiciary losing ground to executive overreach and rising political interference. The index is based on 215,000 household surveys and 4,100 surveys of legal practitioners and experts. Source: AAP",Politics,Sadness,Nill,The National
From chaos to code: why AI is boosting developer ranks,https://www.thenational.com.pg/from-chaos-to-code-why-ai-is-boosting-developer-ranks/,29/10/2025,"Brisbane: Artificial intelligence technology is not just helping to create more software but to create more software developers after a leading platform added a record 36 million users in one year. The coding tools could address some of Australia’s skills shortages, experts said, even though additional training would be required. GitHub reported the results at its annual developers event on Wednesday, also revealing that eight in 10 new users deployed AI in their first week on the platform. The announcement comes after the Tech Council of Australia predicted AI could help to create 200,000 jobs in the country by 2030 and as the federal government considers what regulations will be required to govern its safe use. GitHub, the world’s largest software development platform, introduced AI tools in 2021 but the company said the technology had delivered its largest growth to date in 2025. More than 36 million new users joined the platform in the year to August, bringing its user base to more than 180 million, according to its Octoverse report, and representing growth of 23 per cent. Most new users adopted its AI software within their first week and GitHub Asia Pacific vice-president Sharryn Napier said the trend proved software developers did not view AI as an enemy. “The story of 2025 isn’t AI versus developers – it’s about AI transforming how developers work,” she said. “More developers moving faster is good news for Australia as we continue to tackle our tech skills shortage and productivity challenges.” The company’s newest users included first-time developers, students and people trying to solve tech problems who did not see themselves as software creators, GitHub chief operating officer Kyle Daigle said. But veteran developers and open-source contributors were also using AI agents more often, he said, and in more places. “Sometimes we can get caught up in the Silicon Valley nature or the North American nature of it but where we’re seeing the growth accelerating so aggressively is outside of this single microcosm,” he told AAP. “This is the biggest year of growth that GitHub has ever experienced and it is incredibly global.” The company also revealed plans to expand its AI features, adding support for agents from companies including OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Cognition and xAI. The wider support would help software developers to choose the best tools for their tasks, Mr Daigle said, and could help to bring more clarity to what had become “innovative chaos” since the launch of generative AI tools. AI had the potential to accelerate productivity over the next five years, he said, both in training more developers and helping others solve problems faster. “I want to be able to do things that are not economically viable today or weren’t years ago because the tools are there,” he said. “We’re seeing more open-source projects created on GitHub than ever before.

AUKUS subs deal won’t be expanded to include Japan: PM,https://www.thenational.com.pg/aukus-subs-deal-wont-be-expanded-to-include-japan-pm/,29/10/2025,"Canberra: Anthony Albanese has shut down suggestions of Japan being a fourth player in the Aukus alliance, despite the ally helping to produce frigates for Australia’s defence forces. The prime minister held talks with his newly elected Japanese counterpart Sanae Takaichi, the first woman to hold the role, on the sidelines of the Asean summit in Malaysia. “The meeting I had … was very positive and constructive. She has invited me to come to Japan,” Albanese told reporters in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday. Takaichi told Albanese she wanted to “promote strategic co-operation with Australia” and improve the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) co-operation. The Quad, which includes the United States, Australia, Japan and India, was set up to counter China militarily and diplomatically in the Indo-Pacific region. While Albanese said Australia was purchasing Japanese-made Mogami frigates, Japan would not play a part of the Aukus pact alongside the US and UK “Aukus is an arrangement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States and we’re very much focused on delivering that,” Albanese said. “Of course, the Mogami frigates that we are purchasing from Japan are going to be very important.” He said the frigates will also be produced in Western Australia with the support of Japan. Albanese spruiked the critical minerals deal inked with the US last week after being asked whether China would question the agreement. The agreement aims to challenge China’s global market dominance of critical minerals and rare earth elements. “Just as Australia has benefited from resources in the last century, such as iron ore, that will continue,” Albanese said.

North Korea shows its firepower as Trump visits South,https://www.thenational.com.pg/north-korea-shows-its-firepower-as-trump-visits-south/,29/10/2025,"Seoul: North Korea has trumpeted the success of its recent test-firings of sea-to-surface cruise missiles, in another display of its growing military capabilities as US President Donald Trump visits South Korea. North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said the missiles fired on Tuesday flew for more than two hours before accurately striking targets in its western waters. It said the weapons would contribute to expanding the operational sphere of the country’s nuclear-armed military. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the military had detected the North Korean launch preparations and that the cruise missiles were fired in the North’s northwestern waters at around 3 pm Tuesday. The joint chiefs said South Korea and the United States were analysing the weapons and maintaining a combined defence readiness capable of a “dominant response” against any North Korean provocation. The North Korean report came hours before an expected summit between Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in the city of Gyeongju, where South Korea is hosting this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings. Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One en route from Japan to South Korea, Trump downplayed the North Korean launches. “He’s been launching missiles for decades, right?” he said, referring to Kim Jong Un. Trump reiterated he still wants to meet with Kim, whom he met three times in 2018 and 2019 before their diplomacy derailed over disagreements on US-led sanctions against the North. “We had a really good understanding of each other,” Trump said. KCNA said the tests were attended by senior military official Pak Jong Chon, who also inspected training for sailors aboard North Korea’s newly developed destroyers Choe Hyon and Kang Kon, which leader Kim Jong Un has described as key assets in his efforts to strengthen the navy. North Korea’s latest launches followed short-range ballistic missile tests last week that it said involved a new hypersonic system designed to strengthen its nuclear war deterrent. During his South Korean visit, Trump is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. However, South Korean officials have said a Trump–Kim meeting is unlikely. North Korea has shunned any form of talks with Washington and Seoul since Kim’s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump fell apart in 2019 during the American president’s first term. Kim’s top foreign policy priority is now Russia. In recent months, he has sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment to help fuel President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, while embracing the idea of a “new Cold War” and positions his country as part of a united front against the US-led West. Last month, Kim reiterated he wouldn’t return to talks with the United States unless Washington drops its demand for North Korea’s denuclearisation, after Trump repeatedly expressed his hopes for new diplomacy.

Anzacs’ messages in a bottle found on Australian beach,https://www.thenational.com.pg/anzacs-messages-in-a-bottle-found-on-australian-beach/,29/10/2025,"Melbourne: Messages in a bottle written by two soldiers on their voyage to the battlefields of France during World War I have been found more than a century later on Australia’s coast. The Brown family found the Schweppes-brand bottle just above the waterline at Wharton Beach near Esperance in WA earlier this month. Deb Brown, her husband Peter and daughter Felicity made the find during one of the family’s regular quad bike expeditions to clear the beach of trash. “We do a lot of cleaning up on our beaches and so would never go past a piece of rubbish. So this little bottle was lying there waiting to be picked up,” she said. Inside were cheerful letters written in pencil by Privates Malcolm Neville, 27, and William Harley, 37, dated Aug 15, 1916. Their troop ship HMAT A70 Ballarat had left Adelaide on August that year on the long journey to the other side of the world where its soldiers would reinforce the 48th Australian Infantry Battalion on Europe’s Western Front. Neville was killed in action a year later. Harley was wounded twice but survived the war, dying in Adelaide in 1934 of a cancer his family say was caused by him being gassed by the Germans in the trenches. Neville requested the bottle’s finder deliver his letter to his mother at Wilkawatt, now a virtual ghost town in South Australia. Harley wrote “may the finder be as well as we are at present.” Neville wrote to his mother he was “having a real good time, food is real good so far, with the exception of one meal which we buried at sea.” The ship was “heaving and rolling, but we are as happy as Larry,” he wrote. Deb Brown suspects the bottle didn’t travel far. It likely spent more than a century ashore buried in the sand dunes. Extensive erosion of the dunes caused by huge swells along Wharton Beach in recent months probably dislodged it. The paper was wet, but the writing remained legible. Because of that, Deb Brown was able to notify both soldiers’ relatives of the find. Harley’s granddaughter Ann Turner said her family was “absolutely stunned” by the find. “We just can’t believe it. It really does feel like a miracle and we do very much feel like our grandfather has reached out for us from the grave,” Turner told the ABC. Neville’s great nephew Herbie Neville said his family had been brought together by the “unbelievable” discovery. “It sounds as though he was pretty happy to go to the war. It’s just so sad what happened. It’s so sad that he lost his life,” Herbie Neville said. “What a man he was,” the great nephew added with pride. Source: AP",History,Sadness,Nill,The National
"Marape appeals for calm, peace to ensure safe polling",https://www.thenational.com.pg/marape-appeals-for-calm-peace-to-ensure-safe-polling/,28/10/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has appealed to all candidates and voters to uphold peace, discipline, and respect during the Local Level Government (LLG) elections. In a statement, he said: “The Electoral Commission, with the support of local-level administrators is doing its absolute best to ensure a free, fair and safe elections. “I urge all candidates and voters not to cause stress or disruption to their communities. “Elections are serious national exercises, and they must be conducted with dignity, peace and respect.” Marape explained that through legislative amendments, the Government has now legitimised and properly aligned the timing of LLG elections so that they are held midterm between national elections. This reform, he said, provides greater consistency in governance and allows for a timely refresh of local leadership across the country. “Since the deferral of the 2017 LLG elections, we have worked to bring the system into proper alignment,” he said. “The amendments we made now give certainty. National elections are held every five years, and LLG elections at midterm. “This ensures that democratic renewal continues smoothly at all levels.” He said that LLG presidents had an important role in the country’s governance framework as members of District Development Authorities (DDAs) and Provincial Assemblies, ensuring that local voices contributed meaningfully to district and provincial planning. “Do not vote for wantoks or sell your vote for a meal,” he said. “Vote for someone who is a true leader, a person respected in your community, who lives a disciplined life, takes care of their family, does not drink excessively or gamble away family resources, and who helps mediate disputes and promotes peace. “I encourage all Papua New Guineans to cast their votes correctly and peacefully, choosing leaders who will unite, serve, and strengthen our communities.”",Politics,Trust,James Marape,The National

Electoral Commissioner calls for review of LLG processes,https://www.thenational.com.pg/electoral-commissioner-calls-for-review-of-llg-processes/,28/10/2025,"ELECTORAL Commissioner Simon Sinai has called for a review of the local level government (LLG) processes, particularly the creation of new wards and LLGs. He said that the issue needed to be addressed by the Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs to prevent further deferrals of future LLG elections. “These legal issues need to be handled with care, such as identifying a voter for a new ward and creating a new roll,” he said. “Once you have separated the voters according to the new wards from the existing rolls, you then take into account new voters who are not on the roll but turned 18 and are eligible to vote. “The 2022 electoral roll can be used as the base to update the roll. “But if any person who is not happy must object to the enrolment which is provided for under Section 48 of the Organic Law on National and Local Level Government Elections.” Sinai added that the issues which arose from the creation of new wards and LLGs strained the resources of the commission. “Provincial electoral staff were placed under pressure to identify and create new rolls before polling could start. “To avoid a repeat of such situations in future, the LLG processes need reviewing so that the legal requirements for creating news wards and LLGs are strictly managed and guided and implemented within a fixed timeline,” he said. “The Electoral Commission is required to prepare the electoral rolls six months before the anniversary of the next election, be it the general election or the local level government elections. “Due to staff shortage, the commission gets support from LLG public servants and provincial administrations to assist with the roll updates in provinces.” He recommended that a holistic approach be taken to review the LLG system of the country to avoid such issues in the future. “We are asking the Government, provincial administrations, LLGs, wards and citizens to help identify voters for the good of the elections.”",Politics,Anticipation,Nill,The National
West New Britons cast ballots in LLG election,https://www.thenational.com.pg/west-new-britons-cast-ballots-in-llg-election/,28/10/2025,"POLLING for the 2025 Local Level Government (LLG) elections is afoot in West New Britain as voters cast their ballots for the future leaders of the 12 LLGs and 119 wards. Provincial election advisory committee chairman John Sitapai said all polling teams had been deployed to assist during the polling period which started yesterday. A one-day polling period was held for the four LLGs of Kimbe Urban, Talasea, Mosa and Hoskins. All other LLGs in the country will go to the polls as per their respective schedules before polling ends on Nov 8. “We have beefed up the number of our polling teams so that they are able to help the people cast their votes and ensure that the elections are done well,” Sitapai said. “People are expected to vote for good leaders in a very important tier of government. “It is up to our people to choose the right leaders who will lead them in the future.” He urged government agencies and businesses operating in the province to allow time for workers to exercise their constitutional right to vote during the election period. Talasea MP Freddie Kumai, who cast his vote yesterday at the Kimbe Urban LLG polling site, said that the elections had been a long time coming for the people of West New Britain. “Despite the many deferrals, I am sure that the people are happy that the LLG elections has started,” he said. “LLGs are a very important tier of the government and we, as national leaders, must also support. “It is an important tier of government that is closest to the people so we must do our part to assist them, especially by ensuring that this year’s LLG elections is conducted successfully.”",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National
Training combined to develop combat skills,https://www.thenational.com.pg/training-combined-to-develop-combat-skills/,28/10/2025,"EVERY year, soldiers from the Australian and Papua New Guinea Defence Forces unite in a show of military cooperation on Exercise Wantok Warrior, a series of training activities focused on developing infantry skills at the Combat Team level. This year around 300 soldiers and officers from the PNGDF and ADF, including frontline troops and support staff, have been carrying out daily drills and war games. Liaison officer Major Derek Levi, who was an instructor at the School of Military Engineering at Holsworthy Barracks in Sydney, said it was important to train the tactics and capabilities that would be required in conflicts. “It’s good to train on them and know how to use them, so that if a fight comes we’ll be ready,” Levi said. Since its first iteration in 2005, the exercise has cemented itself as one of the most noteworthy bilateral training activities undertaken annually between the two countries. Over the 20 years since its inception, the exercise has developed in complexity by incorporating multiple platforms to increase interoperability and shared understanding. This provided participating members from both countries with exciting opportunities to share skills, resulting in enhanced leadership and military capability for both countries. For many, this exercise is one of the highlights of the year, affording soldiers from both countries the opportunity to work closely with their counterparts and friends from across the Torres Strait. Daily combat scenarios included small boat insertions to attack fictitious enemy air defences, long jungle patrols, casualty treatment and aero-medical evacuation as well as the defence of critical infrastructure. Airlifted into Lae on CH-47F Chinook helicopters, the integrated force from First Royal Pacific Islands Regiment, PNGDF Engineering Battalion and First Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment, used Igam Barracks as a base for operations. A key objective for this year’s exercise was to practise capturing and securing critical infrastructure, which included urban clearance drills. For 28-year-old Private Mikessy Anthony, from Poloko Village in the Southern Highlands, ocean-going small boat drills were far and away the most daunting. “We went in the boats yesterday and I was a bit scared, it was my first time in a boat,” Anthony said. “The exercise isn’t just about training and capability, it’s also an opportunity for our troops to build on the friendships and camaraderie that our defence partnership is founded on.” Anthony said working with the ADF was rewarding experience for the different skills and techniques they were able to pass on. “Working together with the ADF I’ve learnt a lot, we’ve been able to bring different ideas and have this shared experience.”",Military,Trust,Nill,The National

Assistant Police Commissioner National Capital District and Central Benjamin Turi urged residents to provide information to police for arrests to be made. “Seeing the crime scene myself, it doesn’t make sense. It’s not that far from where people collect water,” he said. “Our homicide will have to dig deeper and check the parents, the aunty and the person who sleeps inside the vehicle and the community.” The three are cousins – a girl and her two cousin brothers – who had followed an aunt of theirs for a wash and wait for her to fetch water. Turi said it didn’t make sense because the area is surrounded by houses and the water area is always packed with people. He urged parents to always keep an eye out for their children there are cases of minors being abused or murdered. This is the second time in the same year for police to deal with such suspicious cases involving children under 10 years. “This is similar to the Gereka case a few months back where the decomposed bodies of two cousins were found after three months but this case is a day and a half,” he said. “The aunty who had brought them down to the water area will also be taken in for questioning, as well as the parents.” According to police reports, the girl had bruises on her waists and a post-mortem will be done soon and investigation is ongoing. Turi said the three went missing on Friday between 3pm and 5pm and a complaint was laid.

Forensic attended to the crime scene and took pictures,” he said. “Particulars from witnesses were taken. The bodies were transported to the hospital and person of interest taken into custody.” Police also said when they checked the scene, the children were naked. Their clothes were placed next to them.

High court reserves Paraka decision,https://www.thenational.com.pg/high-court-reserves-paraka-decision/,28/10/2025,"THE Supreme Court has reserved its ruling on an application by convicted lawyer Paul Paraka to set aside the decision which dismissed his appeal on conviction to a later date. A three-man bench comprising justices David Cannings, George Manuhu and Joseph Yagi yesterday presided over Paraka’s appeal. Paraka, who is representing himself, filed the application and has sought orders to set aside the decision which dismissed his appeal on conviction, arguing that there was some judicial bias. He said there was no evidence that proved the allegations against him at that time was true and argued that his conviction made by the primary judge was based on lies. Paraka was found guilty of five counts of misappropriating K162 million of State money and was jailed 20 years. He said there were transactions made at that time, but none of them were deposited into the Paraka Lawyers bank account. He asked the court to assess what is before them, the affidavits and said they would realise that there was no evidence of deposit records. Paraka also informed the court that the decision on his bail application sought on serious medical grounds for medical treatment overseas heard last month before the National Court, is yet to be made. He asked the bench to grant him a bail of K5,000, pending his appeal on sentence. State prosecutor Helen Roalakona objected and argued that the application is well out of time which is 21 days. The State argued that there were no exceptional circumstances or a reasonable explanation to the appeal, as the application is not compliant before the Supreme Court Rules. The State submitted that the jurisdiction has not been invoked, with respect to the slip rule application. On the ground of appeal in terms of perception bias, the State submitted that it has been misleading in what is being sought and is an abuse of the court’s process.

Nomane granted application,https://www.thenational.com.pg/nomane-granted-application/,28/10/2025,"THE Supreme Court yesterday granted Chuave MP James Nomane’s application to challenge the position of Opposition leader held by Douglas Tomuriesa. A five-man bench comprising Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika and justices Kingsley Allan David, David Cannings, George Manuhu and Derek Hartshorn ruled that Nomane had raised significant constitutional issues which were justifiable. Nomane had filed the application through his lawyer Paul Mawa, seeking declaration pursuant to Section 64(2) of the Organic Law on Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates (OLIPPAC) for purposes of electing the Opposition leader in a democratic manner. Nomane is asking the court to declare that support for him as the Opposition leader by 10 out of the 18 Opposition MPs satisfied the requirements of Section 64(2) of the OLIPPAC. Nomane’s lawyer argued that section 64 may not be directly a provision, but is a Constitutional right. He said that Nomane is only asking the court to declare that he has standing to challenge Tomuriesa’s position, which according to OLIPPAC referred to the majority rules. Tomuriesa’s lawyer argued that Nomane had no standing, and that the application did not raise a serious constitutional issue. He submitted that the application should be dismissed. Second intervener Attorney-General Pila Niningi made no objections and supported Nomane’s application. The bench declared that Nomane has standing to bring this matter to this court. “We are satisfied that he has sufficient interest as a member of the Opposition. The interpretation and application of section 64 of the OLIPPAC is a serious issue. “We agree that Nomane has standing and the application is granted,” the bench said. In June, 10 out of the 18 MPs in the Opposition caucus endorsed Nomane’s nomination as the Opposition leader after Tomuriesa became the leader of the People’s Progress Party and reduced himself to a one-man party. On July 29, Parliament Speaker Job Pomat announced that he would recognise Tomuriesa as the Opposition leader and James Donald as the deputy opposition leader.

He said he was grateful for the guidance from the school and assistance from family and friends. MTI principal Vipin Vincent said over the training period of 16 weeks from July to October, what the students had learnt had been transformed into real work readiness and despite challenges in terms of funding and transportation, they had shown resilience and willingness to learn. He said Mapex had up-skilled the nation for the past 20 years, with more than 10,000 graduates now employed in different sectors in the country.

Provincial and LLG Affairs Department Secretary Philip Leo also warned provincial and district administrators not to assist ineligible candidates, such as public servants who had not resigned from their positions as required by law. They would be in breach of the Organic Law on National and Local Level Government Elections provisions and the Public Services (Management) Act,” he said. “Electoral officials must verify the employment status of all candidates prior to polling,” he said. “Provincial and district administrators must enforce disqualification provisions and report any breaches to the Electoral Commission and the Department of Personnel Management. “Public awareness campaigns should be conducted to educate communities about lawful candidacy requirements. “Electoral officials who knowingly facilitate ineligible candidates may face disciplinary action. “Allowing unqualified individuals to contest undermines the integrity of the electoral process and could lead to legal challenges, nullification of election results and loss of public trust.” Electoral Commissioner Simon Sinai warned that penalties for disrupting elections were severe, including a life ban on contesting elections. “The minister responsible can use his powers to suspend elections in any affected LLG and ward where fights and disruptions occur,” he said. “I am again appealing to all candidates and supporters to observe and respect the laws, respect one another and ensuring a peaceful election.” Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs Minister Soroi Eoe warned that the LLG elections would be declared failed in areas where the election processes were disrupted.",Politics,Trust,Soroi Eoe,The National

Hospital chief executive officer Dr Kipas Binga said the most recent power outage was last weekend when it was off for more 20 hours, during which about five deaths were reported. “We (however) cannot say that all were directly due to the power situation,” he said. “Three of those (deaths) were expected. “It just so (that they) happened (when) the power was out. “The other two (persons) were quite sick and machine-dependent.” Binga said that on Saturday, Oct 18 at around 9pm, the blackouts caused a fire in the PNG Power circuit breaker connecting to the hospital. It reportedly caused a technical fault, leaving the system unable to read accurately, and switching between two alternating power sources – the PNG Power main grid and Angau’s Central Energy Unit. “The lever was locked in so even when the PNG Power supply went off, our system was reading that there was power from the main grid,” Binga said. He said the hospital had been relying on a power generator for over a week. “The hospital consumes about 5000ltrs of fuel over a 24-hour period,” he said. “This is a big concern for us, especially when 20ltrs cost about K78,000. “We are struggling to find money to find fuel to sustain us. “According to our technical team, the breaker parts need to be procured from Australia. It needs to be assembled and sent over. “This will take up four weeks after payments are made. “Quotations were finalised from supplier on Friday evening. “Will make payment, hopefully Monday or Tuesday. “The Australian department of foreign affairs and trade is willing to assist us doing this.” Binga also revealed plans to install solar panels. “Hopefully we are supported through our submission for 2026 for solar power which would really help us cost wise,” he said.",Health,Fear,Nill,The National

District administrator Freddy Lemeki said that the projects were funded by the District Services Improvement Programme (DSIP) and Provincial Services Improvement Programme (PSIP) funds. They include the upgrading and extension of the Watom seawall, rehabilitation work on Blanche Street, repairs on Second 22nd Street and Tunnel Hill Road and the completion of the Toleap reinforced cncrete box culvert. Lemeki said the 80-metre sea wall built in front of the Vunakabai government station at Watom was a priority, as the area had been badly affected by rising sea levels and coastal erosion. The project, constructed by Senuak Contractors under DSIP funding, took four months to complete. It now provides much-needed protection for coastal communities and public facilities that were once at risk of being washed away. He said that the road works and rehabilitation projects were expected to significantly improve the transportation network within Rabaul town and surrounding areas. The Blanche Street rehabilitation, Second 22nd Street and Tunnel Hill Road projects undertaken by Nivani Limited, have a combined value of more than K8 million. The upgrades are expected to reduce travel times, improve road safety, and support local economy. The Toleap culvert, completed by Senuak Contractors for K373,862.50, ensures that the road remains accessible even during heavy rains, addressing long-standing issues of flooding and erosion that once made the area impassable.

Acting Minister for Information and Communications Technology, Peter Tsiamalili Jr said: “Cybercrime is one of the fastest-growing global challenges, with losses exceeding US$9.5 trillion (about K39.9 trillion) in 2024 and projected to surpass US$10.5 trillion (about K44.1 trillion) in 2025.” The signing took place on Oct 25 at the National Convention Centre in Hanoi, Vietnam, where Steven Matainaho, Secretary for the Department of Information and Communications Technology, signed on behalf of Papua New Guinea. He was accompanied by chief legal officer of Nicta Oala Moi. Tsiamalili said this followed two recent Cabinet decisions to ratify international conventions on cybercrime, making PNG one of the few Pacific countries now to start the ratification journey for international frameworks on cybercrime. Next month, PNG is expected to deposit an accession instrument for the pioneering cybercrime international convention, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. Acceding to both the Hanoi Convention and the Budapest Convention would provide a foundation for PNG for stronger cooperation, harmonised laws, and coordinated responses to digital threats. Tsiamalili said cybercrime affected citizens, economies and governments, demanding collaboration to protect digital trust and security. “The department will now work with the United Nations and the Council of Europe to review and modernise our national laws and institutions,” he said. “This includes updating the Cybercrime Code Act, Electronic Transactions Act, introducing Digital ID, Cybersecurity, Data Protection legislation and strengthening coordination between the department, Nicta, the police Cybercrime Unit and other agencies.”",Technology,Trust,Nill,The National

He said the district development authority (DDA) had even gone to the extent of funding maintenance work due to flooding and other deterioration. “Since my election, concerns about the state of the Bulolo Wau Menyamya Highway have always been my priority,” Basil said. “I have raised this in Parliament to the Minister for Works and Prime Minister and have written numerous letters and raised it in the media. “I am disappointed to say that both TSSP and Works Department have failed.” He said that the Highway had disintegrated into a bush track and was much worse than when the funding was provided. Basil said that the Prime Minister, James Marape, launched the maintenance twice and also traveled to Wau and Bulolo in 2023 to launch the two district plans. “It would have been better for the Government to distribute the K150 million to the development authorities of Huon Gulf, Bulolo and Wau-Waria, so that we could have bought graders, trucks and patched the holes and cleaned the drains,” he said. “I wish to assure the people of Bulolo and Morobe that I waited for the Works and Highways Department.

Archbishop of Port Moresby Sir John Cardinal Ribat said many lay Catholic men and women, especially those who gave their time and life to the Church in the ministry of catechists in PNG and the Solomon Islands, continued to actively serve in the ministry, many 50 years and beyond. “The church depends on you. You keep the church alive, in the parishes, schools, hospitals, rural missions and remote communities where no one would dare to go,” he said. Cardinal Ribat, as the main celebrant in the thanksgiving mass for Saint Peter ToRot, held yesterday in Port Moresby, reflected on the life of the Catholic Church and its contribution to the country’s development, and why it was important for others to understand and accept Martyr Peter ToRot as the country’s first Saint.

The meeting comes a day after Marape launched the Reset PNG@50 roadmap, Papua New Guinea’s development blueprint for the next 20 years. Marape revealed at that time that more than K56 billion has been to provincial governments, government agencies, districts, and public institutions in the last six years for development purposes. With the leap in the PNG population to 10.1 million, Marape also warned of the urgency in matching this expanded growth with service delivery to the people. Marape was informed by the Auditor-General that there was very little response from across the government sector in government agencies submitting their financial reports. As is the requirement under law, all public agencies must submit their financial reports by 31 March every year. The office is an independent constitutional office of government established under Section 213 of the Constitution to audit public accounts and oversee financial transactions to make sure public funds are used efficiently and with accountability. The office does this by conducting financial audits, performance evaluations, and investigations across national, provincial, and statutory bodies, and reports the findings to Parliament for review by the Public Accounts Committee. Marape directed that the Auditor-General’s Office (AGO) furnish to him with a full brief on the audits of all government institutions to date. He also gave his full assurance that the AGO would be fully resourced from next year, 2026, onwards in terms of budgetary support so the office is best placed to carry out its duties. “For too long, we have not given fair consideration to the AGO but this will change. I now give my full support to the office”. Marape reassured the AGO of its constitutional mandate, adding that any other government mechanism set up in this area, such as the newly-established National Monitoring Coordinating Authority (NMCA), will only work to support the AGO in carrying out its responsibilities. “The NMCA will do the physical checks. You will come at the back to do the actual audit to make sure that the funds have been put to good use,” he said. Marape said he would make an announcement at the next Parliament sitting of the names of all non-complying public institutions who fail to meet this mandatory requirement to furnish annual financial reports.",Government,Trust,James Marape,The National
Top cop: Laws on sorcery-related killings a worry,https://www.thenational.com.pg/top-cop-laws-on-sorcery-related-killings-a-worry/,27/10/2025,"ASSISTANT police commissioner (Northern) Peter Guinness says the laws addressing sorcery-related killings have had little impact, as such offences continue to occur despite existing legal provisions. Guinness noted that most victims of sorcery-related killings are vulnerable individuals in the communities. He also suggested that the government consider separating sorcery-related offences from the PNG Criminal Code Act to address the issue more effectively. “This means that sorcery should have an Act of its own. Those commuting crimes in relation to it, the person alleged to have committed the crime, (and) the burden of prove can be shifted to that person,” Guinness said. He said when an accused person appears in court, they should be able to present evidence proving that the victim was indeed a sorcerer, allowing the court to assess the validity of the claim. For other cases, the burden of proof is always with the State to prove beyond reasonable doubt, but for sorcery-related cases, it has to be reversed so that the burden of proof has to be with the accused. Guinness gave an example that when the accused go to court, they can then prove to the court by way of evidence to tell the court that the person is really a sorcerer. “This means that the accused person(s) must produce to the court that the deceased or those injured were involved in sorcery act and let the court decide,” he said. He made these comments after noting that lately in Lae, sorcery-related killing and injuring of innocent people has gone out of hand. That is not only in Morobe but throughout the country. “When this Act comes into play, it will assist to minimize the number of sorcery related killings and torturing” He said any offences in relation to sorcery have to be dealt with separately from the Criminal Code Act. Guinness said that, while the Westminster system of government may not support such changes, sometimes laws need to accommodate local customs and practices in order to be more effective.",Society,Fear,Nill,The National

Eoe also noted that PNG’s cultural and linguistic diversity reflects the UN’s global mission of unity through diversity. “Like the United Nations, we are a nation of hundreds of languages and cultures, yet united under one flag,” he said. Eoe outlined how, over the past five decades, PNG had exercised principled leadership at the UN, especially on issues that directly affect its people. “We speak for communities on the frontline of climate change,” he said. “We advocate for sustainable oceans, forest stewardship, and financing models that reward countries protecting the lungs and blue carbon sinks of the planet.” Eoe said these positions were rooted in the daily realities of Papua New Guineans — from the Highlands to the Sepik, and from the Bismarck to the Coral Sea. Eoe highlighted the strength of the partnership between PNG and the UN across key areas such as climate-resilient infrastructure, clean energy, and job-creating agriculture. “When droughts, landslides, and health emergencies struck, the UN stood with us – from vaccination campaigns to emergency relief and reconstruction. This is multilateralism in action: a hand extended when it matters most,” he said.

The programme complements Australia’s broader package of off-grid investments being undertaken in partnership with the PNG Government and rural and remote communities across PNG. The projects at Sanananda Aid Post and Mt Koiari FODE Centre build on KTF’s successful pilot mini-grid at Kokoda College launched early this year, which improved outcomes for more than 200 students. REnew Pacific responds directly to the Pacific’s call for urgent climate action, showcasing Australia’s climate leadership and partnership in tackling the region’s greatest shared challenge. It sits within the Pacific Climate Infrastructure Financing Partnership, a A$350 million (about K959 million) initiative delivered through the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific. This announcement brings the Australian Government’s investment in off-grid renewable energy in Papua New Guinea to more than K80 million (A$33 million).",Development,Joy,Nill,The National
"US Navy helicopter, jet crash into South China Sea",https://www.thenational.com.pg/us-navy-helicopter-jet-crash-into-south-china-sea/,27/10/2025,"WASHINGTON: A fighter jet and a helicopter based off the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz both crashed into the South China Sea within 30 minutes of each other on Sunday afternoon, the Navy’s Pacific Fleet said. The three crew members of the MH-60R Sea Hawk helicopter were rescued, and the two aviators in the F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter jet ejected and were recovered safely, and all five “are safe and in stable condition”, the fleet said in a statement. The causes of the two crashes were under investigation, the statement said. The USS Nimitz is returning to its home port in Naval Base Kitsap in Washington state after having been deployed to the Middle East for most of the summer as part of the US response to attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on commercial shipping. The carrier is on its final deployment before decommissioning. Another aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S Truman, suffered a series of mishaps in recent months while deployed to the Middle East. In December, the guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg mistakenly shot down an F/A-18 jet from the Truman. Then, in April, another F/A-18 fighter jet slipped off the Truman’s hangar deck and fell into the Red Sea. And in May, an F/A fighter jet landing on the carrier in the Red Sea went overboard after apparently failing to catch the steel cables used to stop landing planes and forcing its two pilots to eject. No sailors were killed in any of those mishaps. The results of investigations into those incidents have yet to be released. Source: AP",Military,Fear,Nill,The National
"Asean risks losing credibility if it fails to stay united, warns PM Wong",https://www.thenational.com.pg/asean-risks-losing-credibility-if-it-fails-to-stay-united-warns-pm-wong/,27/10/2025,"KUALA LUMPUR: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) must “stand together as one” in an increasingly uncertain world or risk losing its credibility and relevance on the global stage, said Singapore’s Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on Sunday. Speaking at a closed-door retreat session held at the end of the first day of the 47th Asean Summit in Kuala Lumpur, he said Asean must safeguard its centrality and demonstrate its ability to resolve differences and maintain peace among itself. Wong expressed hope for swift resolutions to both the recent border tensions between Cambodia and Thailand, as well as Myanmar’s ongoing political crisis. Thailand and Cambodia had been locked in a border dispute, with tensions escalating in July into their deadliest military clashes in decades, killing more than 40 people and forcing around 300,000 to flee their homes. Both sides agreed to a ceasefire on Jul 28 after talks in Kuala Lumpur mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the bloc’s rotating chair. On the sidelines of the Asean summit on Sunday, an agreement to cease all hostilities at the disputed border area and release captured soldiers was signed by both countries. Wong commended Malaysia’s efforts in finding a diplomatic solution and welcomed the signing of the agreement. However, this is “only the beginning”, he said. “There is still a long road ahead, and Singapore encourages both sides to exercise restraint to avoid any further escalation, and to resolve differences through peaceful engagement and dialogue, and established mechanisms.” On Myanmar, which has been in turmoil since a 2021 military coup ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and triggered an armed rebellion, Wong said the immediate priorities are to de-escalate violence, facilitate humanitarian access and create conditions conducive for dialogue. “A sustainable solution and lasting peace is only achievable through constructive dialogue and engagement amongst all key stakeholders, and we have all said this before, that any solution must be Myanmar-owned and Myanmar-led,” he said. He noted that the efforts of the special envoy and the Asean Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance are important, and called for the appointment of a special envoy with a multi-year term “to provide continuity” after Malaysia.

Israel to decide which foreign troops secure truce: PM,https://www.thenational.com.pg/israel-to-decide-which-foreign-troops-secure-truce-pm/,27/10/2025,"Jerusalem: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will determine which foreign forces it will allow as part of a planned international force in the Gaza Strip to help secure a fragile ceasefire under US President Donald Trump’s plan. It remains unclear whether Arab and other states will be ready to commit troops, in part given the refusal of Palestinian Hamas militants to disarm as called for by the plan while Israel has voiced concerns about the make-up of the force. While Trump’s administration has ruled out sending US soldiers into the Gaza Strip, it has been speaking to Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and Azerbaijan to contribute to the international force. “We are in control of our security, and we have also made it clear regarding international forces that Israel will determine which forces are unacceptable to us and this is how we operate and will continue to operate,” Netanyahu said. “This is, of course, acceptable to the United States as well, as its most senior representatives have expressed in recent days,” he told a session of his cabinet. Israel, which besieged the Gaza Strip for two years to back up its air and ground war in the enclave against Hamas after the Palestinian militant group’s cross-border attack on Oct 7, 2023, continues to control all access to the territory. Last week Netanyahu hinted that he would be opposed to any role for Turkish security forces in the enclave. Once-warm Turkish-Israeli relations soured drastically during the Gaza Strip war, with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan criticising Israel’s devastating air and ground campaign in the small Palestinian enclave. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, on a visit to Israel aimed at shoring up the truce, said on Friday the international force would have to be made up of “countries that Israel’s comfortable with”. He made no comment on Turkish involvement. Rubio added that the Gaza Strip’s future governance still needed to be worked out among Israel and partner countries but could not include Hamas.

"Venezuela slams CIA, Trinidad and Tobago ‘provocation’",https://www.thenational.com.pg/venezuela-slams-cia-trinidad-and-tobago-provocation/,27/10/2025,"Caracas: Venezuela’s government has condemned what it says is a military provocation by neighbouring Trinidad and Tobago in co-ordination with the US Central Intelligence Agency, aimed at spurring a full military confrontation with the Latin American nation. Joint military exercises between the US and Trinidad and Tobago are currently under way in the Caribbean and Venezuela said it had captured a group of mercenaries “with direct information of the American intelligence agency” and whose goal it was to carry out a false-flag attack in the region. A false flag attack is an operation when an act is carried out in such a way that a different party appears responsible. “A false flag attack is underway in waters bordering Trinidad and Tobago or from Trinidadian or Venezuelan territory to generate a full military confrontation with our country,” Venezuela’s government said in the statement. The statement, issued by Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, did not offer further details or evidence of the false flag attack accusations. Earlier in October, US President Donald Trump confirmed reports he authorised the CIA to carry out covert operations in Venezuela. Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro has levied accusations of false flag attacks before, including a plan to plant explosives in the US embassy in Caracas in early October. The US State Department was not immediately available for comment. Trump has carried out a number of strikes on boats in the Caribbean and Pacific that the administration claims are trafficking drugs.

Australia holds firm as foreign aid cuts hit Pacific,https://www.thenational.com.pg/australia-holds-firm-as-foreign-aid-cuts-hit-pacific/,27/10/2025,"Canberra: Australia remains the largest foreign aid donor in the Pacific as other Western partners including the US, the UK and New Zealand cut funding. The forecast of aid plateaus through to 2028 with Australia’s increasing infrastructure lending largely offsetting cuts by other donors, the Lowy Institute’s Pacific aid map reveals. “Australia’s steady aid spending and rapid expansion in infrastructure lending looks set to cushion the Pacific from the impact of major donor cuts,” lead author Riley Duke said. “Australia’s dominant role in Pacific development is expanding. “By 2028, it will likely deliver more than double the combined support of Japan, New Zealand, the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.” The map tracked official development finance between 2008 and 2023, which revealed a 16 per cent dip of total funds to about A$5.5 billion (about K15b) in 2023 compared to the previous year. Preliminary data and forecasts have been used for 2024 through to 2028, following the Trump administration cutting foreign aid and Australia stepping up to plug the gaps in the Pacific. Australia makes up 43 per cent of official development finance in the region, four times more than New Zealand in second. China has moved away from loan-financed infrastructure projects to grants and smaller community initiatives. This has allowed Beijing to strengthen political and grassroots ties while spending remains flat. “China now spends less than it did a decade ago, but its aid reaches far deeper into Pacific communities. Projects are smaller but more frequent and locally targeted,” Duke said. While the impact of USAID cuts in the region had been overstated, which played into China’s narrative of US unreliability, it had hurt Washington’s standing in the region, the aid map’s project lead Alexandre Dayant said. “While Washington steps back, Beijing is winning something far more strategic: narrative dominance,” he said. “For Australia, America’s withdrawal is more than inconvenient, it leaves Canberra increasingly alone in countering Chinese influence.” Source: AAP",Business,Trust,Nill,The National
Baby choking case: Man accused of hanging boy in cupboard switches lawyers,https://www.thenational.com.pg/baby-choking-case-man-accused-of-hanging-boy-in-cupboard-switches-lawyers/,27/10/2025,"SINGAPORE: A man who is facing multiple charges of child abuse for repeatedly choking a baby and placing him on a hanger in a cupboard has switched lawyers. The 32-year-old Singaporean man cannot be named due to a gag order on his and the victim’s identities. Their relationship was not specified, but the case is classified as one of domestic violence. The accused was previously represented by Gino Hardial Singh, but he was discharged as counsel at a further mention on Oct 15. In a pre-trial conference on Monday, the man was newly represented by veteran lawyer Amarick Singh Gill and S Ramanujen. The judge adjourned the case for the defence counsel to take instructions from the accused and send representations before the next pre-trial conference. The man was charged in September mostly for abusing a baby he was caring for at a flat in July and August last year, when the boy was between nine and 11 months old. The more than 30 charges he was handed detailed acts like stepping on the baby’s face, pushing the boy’s head into a pail of water, choking the boy repeatedly, suffocating him with a pillow, hanging the baby in a cupboard by the back of his singlet with the door closed and punching his face. The most recent offence is said to have occurred on Sep 16, 2024, at a void deck instead of the usual location, with the accused allegedly twisting the boy’s arms, punching his face, shaking his head forcefully and dragging him along a table by his neck. The next pre-trial conference is set for Nov 24. For each charge of ill-treating a child under the Children and Young Persons Act, the man could be jailed for up to eight years, fined up to US$6,170 (about K26,307), or both.

"Put interest of people before yours, leaders told",https://www.thenational.com.pg/put-interest-of-people-before-yours-leaders-told/,24/10/2025,"THE country’s leaders must not forsake the interest of the people for their own interest, says Dr John Momis. Momis, a founding father of the nation, urged today’s leaders, especially politicians, to empower the people by ensuring that they all have equal opportunities to improve their lives. “Leaders have a responsibility to the people as it is the people who put them in power,” he said. “When we have good leaders, we can develop good systems, structures and policies for our people.” He said some leaders had forgotten the people and had become more concerned about making money and holding on to power. “Leaders in politics must do the right thing because it is through politics that one can do the most good, and it is through the abuse of politics that one can do the most evil,” he said. “We are now at the mercy of a highly centralised and bureaucratised Government.” He made the remarks during the launching of the Reset@50 document at the University of PNG in Port Moresby yesterday. Momis, who was the deputy chairman of the constitution planning committee, mentioned the five national goals and directive principles in the Constitution as the key pillars of development. They are: “We have strayed over time from important principles in the Constitution like the sharing of power,” Momis said. “The Bougainville situation is an example of this. “Our Constitution already recognizes that we are a Christian nation, as well as acknowledging our PNG ways. “We don’t need to change the Constitution again for this. “We need the moral conviction to do what is right for our people.”",Politics,Anger,Nill,The National

PNG’s population at 10.1 million,https://www.thenational.com.pg/pngs-population-at-10-1-million/,24/10/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape, more than a year after the national census was conducted, reveals that the country’s population is 10.1 million. “This is far from the three million in 1975,” he said. “Our population grew faster than our economy – over three per cent annual population growth, while our economy grew at less than three per cent. “That is not sustainable.” The census, conducted by the National Statistical Office on June 16, 2024, was held at the cost of about K200 million. The previous one was held in 2011. Marape said according to the census results from the data collected, there were 10,185,363 persons in the country as of June 16 this year. He said that the census figures indicated that 5,827,441 persons were above the age of 18, while 4,357,922 were below that age. He added that financial accountability was directly linked to the census figures, which revealed that PNG’s population now stood at 10.18 million “With over 10 million citizens to serve, every Kina matters,” he said. “The K56 billion we’ve spent must translate into better services – not lost in bureaucracy, corruption, or inefficiency. “Our number one focus must be economic growth, to generate the revenue needed for services like education, health, and infrastructure.” Meanwhile, National Research Institute Director Dr Osborne Sanida described PNG’s high population growth rate as unsustainable, and worsening the youth bulge and unemployment issues. Sanida said a lack of updated population data used in government policies and plans had led to many pitfalls in national development. “PNG’s population growth of around 3 per cent is higher than its real economic growth, which is unsustainable,” he said. “The unreliability of population data has adversely affected development planning.” For example, he said that the 2011 national census was deemed unreliable. “Instead of a 10-year interval, the 2024 census was 13 years after the previous 2011 census,” he said. “The unsatisfactory conduct of population census has created uncertainty regarding the accurate figures of the population. “Without proper and timely conduct of population census, PNG has been using estimates, which vary from source to source.”",Economy,Fear,James Marape,The National
IRC commissioner Koim joins the Icac fray,https://www.thenational.com.pg/irc-commissioner-koim-joins-the-icac-fray/,24/10/2025,"INTERNAL Revenue Commissioner Sam Koim has inserted himself into the current controversy surrounding the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac). Koim, who previously chaired the successful Taskforce Sweep (TFS), yesterday posted a commentary on Facebook, seeking, as he said, to “separate the facts from the myths”. Koim was referring to recent public exchanges between Prime Minister James Marape and the two suspended deputy commissioners of Icac, Graham Gill and Daniel Baulch. He wrote: “As someone who has championed the fight against corruption for many years, and laid much of the foundation upon which this institution was built, I feel compelled to offer a neutral, factual and historically grounded observation.” He said that Icac had political backing, had constitutional protection and institutional independence but that two years on, Icac’s leadership and delivery were in question. He wrote: “Two years after their appointment, the public expectation was that Icac would already be demonstrating tangible operational results. “This expectation is not unrealistic. “When TFS was given its mandate, operations commenced almost immediately. Icac was launched with far greater legal power, financial backing and international expertise. “The commissioners were expected to leverage this head start, not to embark on long periods of global familiarisation tours or awareness exercises. Their role was to act – to identify, investigate, and prosecute major corruption cases. “Because corruption is a big development challenge and these experts were procured and resourced to address it head on from the get-go.” Koim said the recent public exchange of allegations between the commissioner and the two deputy commissioners revealed a “serious leadership crisis within the Icac that probably explains why there were no results for the last two years”. Koim also asked that in the name of natural justice, a tribunal be convened speedily to ensure the suspended commissioners were heard and justice is served. In a response to Koim on the same forum, Gill said that the IRC commissioner raised some valid points. “For the avoidance of doubt, no-one is blaming the Prime Minister or other politician for the supposed ‘lack of progress’ by the Icac,” Gill said. “What clearly sits with the prime minister as chair of the Appointments Committee is a failure to act when a report of corrupt conduct was personally presented to him, and the suspension of the Deputy Commissioners in the circumstance set out in my earlier statement – which I stand by. “I agree with Koim that there should be an appropriate tribunal, however it would be very nice to be provided with the reasons for our suspension and the opportunity to respond.

That is not a small sum. “But I ask again: what has been achieved? Where are the results? Are we seeing improvement in schools, hospitals, and roads?” Marape said that recent administrative reviews had uncovered serious gaps in financial reporting and compliance, including agencies and authorities failing to submit expenditure reports for several years. He said the Government would no longer tolerate poor financial management. Every public officer entrusted with funds must report transparently. The establishment of the National Monitoring and Coordination Authority would oversee every project implementation and expenditure. “This new authority will check where the money goes, what it delivers, and whether it benefits the people,” he said. Marape reminded leaders and officials that their positions were a privilege and responsibility, not an entitlement. “If a minister or superior asks you to do something against the law, stand for what is right,” he said. “The laws come first, not politics, not personalities.” He warned that any official found mismanaging or misusing public funds would be held accountable under the Government’s anti-corruption framework. “Our people have waited too long for change.

Yafai, from Karapia village in Yangoru-Saussia, East Sepik, was found guilty on four counts of misappropriation, and one count of abuse of office. Police Minister Peter Tsiamalili Jnr said the court’s conviction has now provided the legal foundation and momentum for police to begin tracing the stolen K41.8m. Tsiamalili commended the National Court, the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC), and the Office of the Public Prosecutor for their steadfast work leading to Yafai’s conviction, describing the decision as a landmark moment for justice and accountability in Papua New Guinea. “The conviction of Yafai is not just the end of one case — it is the beginning of a full-scale financial recovery operation,” Tsiamalili said. “Now that the courts have established guilt, the RPNGC has a clear legal mandate to follow the money trail — wherever it leads and however far back it goes. No one who participated in these crimes will escape accountability.” He confirmed that Police Commissioner David Manning has directed the Asset Restraint and Recovery Working (Arrow) Group to immediately pursue all assets linked to the stolen funds, including those transferred, hidden, or laundered through associates.

Arrow is now tracing all transactions, properties, and offshore holdings connected to these funds,” Tsiamalili said. “There is no way K41.8 million of public money will simply disappear. The law allows us to seize every asset gained through these crimes and return it to the State.” He warned that white-collar crime was not victimless, stressing that every kina stolen from government accounts deprives Papua New Guineans of essential services and life-saving programmes. “When criminals steal from the State, they steal from the sick in our hospitals, from the children in our schools, and from our police who serve the people,” he said. “The conviction of Yafai gives confidence that the system works — and it empowers us to recover what was stolen, not just from this case but from years of unchecked corruption.”",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National

Kapavore made these comments in response to recent concerns that certain public health facilities in the country were experiencing shortages of medical supplies. “Government procurement processes are time bound and so they may affect timely award of contracts and thereby impact timely delivery of medicines,” he said. “This process shall be refined and improved in subsequent procurements in 2026 to address turnaround times between calling a tender and making an award.” Kapavore said the Health Department had recognised this as a matter of priority and was working with its partners to have it resolved. “The Health Department is working with the World Bank, World Health Organisation and UNICEF to develop a supply chain strategic plan, among other activities such as health facility distribution mapping to address the government recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee,” he said. “It is hoped that this plan will set the foundation for further improvements to the whole supply of medicines in PNG by exploring better strategic interventions that may also include devolving some supply chain functions top Provinces.” Meanwhile, about five public hospitals in East Sepik, Hela, Chimbu, Milne Bay and Lutheran Health Services had been reported to scale down their services and were attending only to emergency cases due to lack of medicine supplies.",Health,Sadness,Elias Kapavore,The National
Industrial centre gets K1.5 million boost,https://www.thenational.com.pg/industrial-centre-gets-k1-5-million-boost/,24/10/2025,"OPERATIONS of Malahang Industrial Centre in Lae have been enhanced following a recent K1.5 million infrastructure boost. Centre manager Catherine Wari said their administration building underwent a complete renovation, 160kv generator set had been installed and four vehicles were acquired to help with staff transportation, security operations and admin purposes. Wari, who has been with the centre for almost 12 years and recently promoted to a managerial role, said this was a first direct financial intervention to MIC from the Department of Commerce and Industry. Under the then Industrial Centre Development Corporation Act 1990, Malahang Industrial Centre was the first establishment of its kind in 1999. Wari said MIC sat on 27 hactares of land, operated by 62 staff, including security personnel taking care of more than 50 plus building tenants (those leasing properties) and more than 30 individual titles (outright purchased vacant allotments). MIC acting managing director Osborne Kiluwa said the most basic step forward had already impacted performance of the centre. He expects the centre to raise more revenue over the coming years. Kiluwa said industrial centres had been the missing link, overlooked for many years. He acknowledged the foresight of the current Minister for Commerce and Industry Win Daki for the allocation of K2 million to MIC which allowed for this improvements to take place. “Industrial centres concepts were initiated to stimulate the economy, especially for small businesses,” he said. “MIC was established with K20m and has grown asset value to more than K100 million; we have contributed a lot to the country’s economy.”",Business,Trust,Nill,The National
NAC to offer airport shuttle and taxi service,https://www.thenational.com.pg/nac-to-offer-airport-shuttle-and-taxi-service/,24/10/2025,"A SHUTTLE bus and taxi service at the Jackson International Airport is to be managed by the National Airport Corporation (NAC), says Civil Aviation Minister Wake Goi. Goi said that it would improve services for passengers arriving or leaving the airport. “The increase in Air Niugini and PNG Air fleet will mean that the available resources, including parking bays at Jackson International Airport, must be effectively managed by NAC, to enable timely movement and processing of passengers from the terminal to the aircraft and vice versa,” he said. “The shuttle service is now operational, following successful trials by the NAC last weekend.” The services are for the domestic, international, and Apec terminals. It is part of a NAC plan to streamline inter-terminal movement, reduce transfer times, and ensure more efficient use of airport resources. It reflects the NAC’s commitment to improve services for travellers. There are also two electric carts (buggies) available to assist passengers with mobility needs. The environmentally-friendly buggies offer a safe and accessible option for navigating terminal areas for passengers with reduced mobility. A regulated taxi service will be introduced under a partnership with a private operator. The service will operate from designated pick-up zones at the domestic and international terminals, providing arriving passengers with a reliable and secure transport option directly from the terminal frontage. Goi said that these improvements were part of a plan to build a more integrated and passenger-focused airport environment at the international airport.",Business,Trust,Wake Goi,The National
Government questioned over jobs,https://www.thenational.com.pg/government-questioned-over-jobs/,24/10/2025,"OPPOSITION Leader Douglas Tomuriesa has questioned the Government over its commitment to provide one million jobs for Papua New Guineans by 2027. Tomuriesa said it was an unrealistic goal as there has been little to no growth in job opportunities over the past five years, especially for youths. He said a lack of jobs has led to the high unemployment rate which has fuelled many of the law and order issues in the country. Last year, Labour and Employment Minister Kessy Sawang announced that the Government had set a goal of creating one million jobs for Papua New Guineans by 2027. She said this was captured in the medium-term development plan four (MTDP 4) as part of the Government’s overall strategy to drive the country’s economic growth and gross domestic product. In February, Prime Minster James Marape commended the National Superannuation Fund (Nasfund) for recording 34,450 new members in 2023, stating that this was a direct reflection of job creation and economic growth in the country’s private sector. He attributed this milestone to the Government’s efforts in fostering economic expansion and creating jobs across various industries. However, Tomuriesa said the reality on the ground was different. Tomuriesa  highlighted the recent dilemma that saw more than 200 Telikom workers retired from their jobs. “It is quite concerning to learn that such a large number of workers were laid off from work,” he said. “If the goal of the Government is to create more jobs, why would it allow for such a retirement exercise to be carried out? “This will only add to the high unemployment rate in the country.” Tomuriesa added that unemployment, especially among the increasing youth population, was a major factor that contributed to lawlessness in communities. “Unemployment is one of the biggest factors contributing to lawlessness,” he said. “It is because of this that service delivery is affected in many parts of the country.”",Politics,Anger,"Douglas Tomuriesa, James Marape, Kessy Sawang",The National

Marape is set to speak at the Leaders’ Session on Nov 6, focusing on rainforest protection, biodiversity, carbon trading, and equitable access to climate finance for developing nations. He emphasised PNG’s role as one of the last large rainforest nations, whose forests absorb carbon for the global good, yet receive minimal recognition or compensation. He reiterated that developed nations, responsible for most global emissions, must honour their climate finance commitments. Marape notably skipped COP29 in 2024 due to dissatisfaction with the lack of action on climate promises. However, he expressed optimism that the collective voices of Pacific and rainforest nations are being heard. He stressed that COP30 will be a pivotal moment to turn promises into tangible outcomes. Papua New Guinea’s growing leadership in climate discussions was highlighted, with a focus on balancing conservation with sustainable development, empowering local communities, and strengthening climate resilience. Marape concluded that PNG’s efforts extend beyond COP30, with plans for post-conference implementation to attract green investments and align policies for future climate action.",Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,The National

The course held at the Second Royal Pacific Islands Regiment (2RPIR) command at Moem Barracks, Wewak, started on Tuesday, with the aim to empower corporals to lead with knowledge and skills and to qualify their ranks. Regiment commanding officer Lt Col Francis Vitata said the corporal rank is more than just another stripe on the sleeve. “It represents trust that is built to lead, mentor and to make decisions when it counts. “From this point onward, you’re not only responsible for yourself, but for those you lead,” he said. Of the 71 soldiers, 41 are from Moem and the rest are from the Lombrum Naval base in Manus. The course is expected to finish by Dec 12. “You’re not here by chance, you’re here because someone recognised your leadership potential. “Now it’s time for you to rise to that challenge.” Vitata said over the coming weeks, they will be tested physically, mentally and morally. “You’ll be given the tools to lead effectively, communicate clearly and enforce standards with integrity,” he said. “Leadership at this level is not about barking commands: It’s about setting the example being the first to step up and the last to step down.” Vitata urged them to be serious, ask questions, challenge themselves, and learn as much as they can from instructors and peers. “Step forward with confidence, humility and determination. “The journey to becoming a corporal starts now,” he said.

Schnaubelt commended the committee for its commitment and professionalism, noting that the meeting marked an important step toward realising New Ireland’s vision for responsible and people-focused autonomy. “The new committee brings together some of our most experienced minds and patriotic citizens who will help refine our autonomy roadmap and work collaboratively with the national government and other provinces,” he said.",Politics,Trust,Walter Schnaubelt,The National
New Ireland communities to benefit from solar project,https://www.thenational.com.pg/new-ireland-communities-to-benefit-from-solar-project/,24/10/2025,"ACCESS to clean affordable energy is expected to raise living standards and empower local communities in New Ireland following the completion of the “Pawa Bilong Niu Ailan” project. The project, implemented by Australia and the United Kingdom, with support from local authorities, installed solar power systems in 74 of the district’s most remote villages. The new solar systems are supplying clean, reliable energy to more than 9,000 households, 76 community facilities and 151 streetlights, lighting up homes, streets and public spaces for more than 35,000 persons. New Ireland Governor Walter Schnaubelt recently joined representatives from Australia and the United Kingdom to congratulate Namatanai authorities on the successful completion of the project. “These solar lights will provide a safe learning environment for our students, and communities’ livelihoods will improve,” he said. Local communities have also played a key role in the project’s long-term success. Through the initiative, a total of 592 local solar champions (296 women and 296 men) have been trained to provide ongoing maintenance for the new solar systems. Backed by a dedicated Solar Hub in Silom village, set up to provide technical guidance and spare parts, the champions are ensuring their communities have access to clean and reliable energy in years ahead. Australian High Commission minister counsellor Dr Cate Rogers commended the commitment and hard work of project partners. “The project owes its success to the communities themselves – their support and participation were vital,” she said. “Australia remains committed to working alongside Papua New Guinea to achieve its ambitious electrification targets – to connect 70 per cent of the population by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2040.”",Development,Joy,Walter Schnaubelt,The National
Governor urges government and department to increase grants,https://www.thenational.com.pg/governor-urges-government-and-department-to-increase-grants/,24/10/2025,"MADANG Governor Ramsey Pariwa has urged the Government and the Department of Implementation and Rural Development (DIRD) to increase constitutional grants. He said this during the presentation of the Madang government’s provincial support grants (PSG) acquittal reports to DIRD on Tuesday. Pariwa said constitutional grants such as the PSG and District Support Grants (DSG), including provincial services improvement programme (PSIP) funds and district services improvement programme (DSIP) funds, which when properly allocated, have ensured effective service delivery touching lives of ordinary people in rural areas “Therefore, I would encourage us to increase it for now as it is outdated compared with the population increase. I don’t know the population from the recent census but the population is increasing every year so if we could increase those PSGs and PSIPs for the provinces up a bit so that we can continue to touch and impact the`small people’ in the villages,” he said. “Maybe increase it to K500,000 for discretionary and K500,000 for non-discretionary components of the PSG, and then we can do much better as we are already doing great. “But we can do better than that if by next year and onwards we increase the ceiling.” Pariwa told DIRD deputy secretary (programme implementation wing) Gordon Wafimbi and his team, who received the acquittals, that it is mandatory that constitutional grants for provinces and districts be released on time and there should be fairness in its allocation to provinces and districts. “But one thing I want to point out here is that these are constitutional grants, and it is important that these funds are released on time and equally to all provinces and districts,” Pariwa said. “All these other big funding such as PIP and others are not constitutional grants, yet they are released while the constitutional grants are delayed and left out. “Constitutional grants must be released according to law. The highest law – the Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Governments – warrants for this funding to be released other than all this other funding is not warranted by law, yet they are released.” The acquittals presented on Tuesday captured last year’s K250,000 discretionary component of the PSG, and a total of K1.4 million rollover of the PSG funds from 2022 to last year, which have been expended to fund prioritised development projects in Madang that were selected based on their potential to deliver tangible benefits to communities. Wafimbi assured Pariwa that his points raised were valid and the DIRD will take it into consideration and relay them through the appropriate channels.",Government,Anticipation,Ramsey Pariwa,The National

He said the National Statistical Office reported that there was 10,185,363 persons in the country as of June 16 this year. “This is far from the three million (persons) in 1975,” he said. Marape said about 4.3 million of this population was under the age of 18, highlighting the youth-heavy nature of PNG’s demographic structure. “This tells us something very important — the majority of our people are young. That’s a lot of mouths to feed, schools to build, teachers to train, and jobs to create,” he said. “In 1975, we were a nation of about 3 million people. “Fifty years later, we are more than 10.1 million strong — that is a massive increase, and it must change how we plan, budget, and deliver. Marape warned that while the population has grown by over 3 per cent annually, economic growth has lagged behind, averaging below 3 per cent. “That is not sustainable. If our population is growing faster than our economy, then we are stretching limited resources thinner and thinner. This is why growing the economic basket is not optional — it is critical.” He stressed that government service delivery should now be planned around real-time, evidence-based data, using accurate population numbers to determine where funding, infrastructure, and staff should go.",Demographics,Anticipation,James Marape,The National

PNG needs policies to aid gender inclusion,https://www.thenational.com.pg/png-needs-policies-to-aid-gender-inclusion/,23/10/2025,"PNG needs to target policies to promote women’s inclusion in the workforce, an academic says. Professor Martin Davies, a visiting lecturer at the University of PNG School of Business and Public Policy, said promoting women’s inclusion in the workforce ensures a fair distribution of economic benefits. “Policies promoting women’s inclusion in the formal labour market, combined with investments in education and training programmes for women, could help close the gender participation gap and ensure that economic gains are evenly distributed across the sexes,” he said. Additionally, gender disparities in labour market participation underscore the need for targeted policies to promote female inclusion in the workforce. “Interestingly, women in the non-mining workforce experienced higher real wage growth than men,” he said. “This is likely to be a reflection of the higher entry barriers women face, and the higher qualifications they require, to secure formal employment.” Davies said according to a new study, which used a dataset from Nasfund superannuation covering all formal private sector workers from 1999 to 2018, there existed gender disparities in real wage trends. He said the findings highlighted structural inequalities in PNG’s labour market, where access to formal sector employment remains limited for women. “During periods of economic expansion, men experienced higher wage growth than women.  However, men also bore wage declines during economic downturns.”",Business,Trust,Nill,The National

The proceeding was put on mobile conference call so Eastern Highlands Governor Simon Sia and his law and good order chairman Robert Atiyafa, could listen in.

Mt Hagen Urban local level government president Paul Tonimb, who represented the relatives, outlined to Sia and Atiyafa the demands. He said the demands were for the upkeep of the family of late Pes and the safety for road users in future. Tonimb said the Kompri to Barola section of the highway had been a notorious part of the highway from the 1980s and many people were killed and injured at the hands of a few people there. Tonimb said police presence must be felt from Barola to Kompri Valley, adding that Eastern Highlands police based in Yonki to Wata Bung should perform their duties diligently.

NIO launches five-year corporate plan,https://www.thenational.com.pg/nio-launches-five-year-corporate-plan/,23/10/2025,"THE National Intelligence Organisation (NIO) corporate plan 2025-2030 that was launched yesterday will be the first for the organisation to be implemented, says acting director-general Lt Col Joshua Dorpar. He said there was a draft document that was formulated in 2015 but didn’t go through verification and approval and thanked former director-general Gary Baki for taking that initiative that year. “In past years the core functions of the NIO were executed without a strategic pathway to guide and provide the leverage for the organisation to achieve its goals and objectives,” he said. “Working in isolation and on adhoc basis, drastically defies the progress in terms of its functionality, operational effectiveness and capability and infrastructure development aspirations.” Dorpar said the formulation of the plan will align PNGNIO’s corporate objective and its strategic intent to be achieved within the five-year term. The eight objectives identified to strengthen national intelligence capabilities, safeguard PNG’s sovereignty and national interests, provide strategic forecasts and assessments to government, enhance intelligence oversight and governance, promote security and good order, build strategic partnerships and intelligence collaboration, advance organisational reform and capability development and ensure accountability and reporting. He said in accordance with the objectives, the four major intents are infrastructure development, organisational restructure, review of the PNGNIO Act and human resource development and training. “The NIO Act 1984 is nearing 80 per cent of the review process and will be tabled in parliament for ratification in the first quarter of 2026,” Dorpar added. “PNGNIO in its current form is the weakest link in the chain of defences to safeguard the country’s national security and sovereignty.” Dorpar also said the plan was the first of many steps needed to transform the organisation so it became an institution effective and efficient in responding to our growing security challenges. “PNG can no longer ignore the ever-changing national security threat environment and we are committed to ensuring that the objectives of the blue print are pursued,” he said. Dorpar added that it encompasses the principles of the broader government policies like Vision 2050, the Medium Term Development Plan 4 and the proposed National Security Policy 2024-2029 to foster a vibrant and robust policy document that will effectively underpin the current and future intentions of the NIO. “With numerous consultative workshops held with stakeholders and internally, the document denotes a vigorous policy document entailed by collective professional inputs from individuals and participants,” he said.",Security,Anticipation,Nill,The National

Nomane said selective warranting had “deprived the people in Chuave of their rightful budget appropriation.” Nomane said Prime Minister James Marape bragged about a historic K28.357 billion national budget that would be a “game changer” for the country but that budget has not translated into service delivery in some districts and parts of the country. “At the end of 2025, we are looking hard to see how this budget had translated into service delivery and tangible development for our people,” he said. “Chuave has not received its budget appropriation. Where is the minimum K20 million under DSIP, DIP and Kina-for-Kina?  Where is the PIP for our roads, power, and our limestone project?  Why are we expected to be beggars in Waigani like the money belongs to the Prime Minister? “Why hasn’t Simbu Provincial Government received its K34 million functional grants? “The time has come to put a stop to this inequity and petty politics based on political cronyism and favouritism. “We must measure leadership by results,” Nomane said. He blamed the government for mismanaging the 2025 budget, calling it “failed because of the Marape government’s unsustainable spending, excessive borrowing, and an unrealistic revenue projection, worsened by weak fiscal management, poor implementation of government policy, and political interference.” Reality is replaced by vanity, pride, and ego with a debt at K65 billion, he said. “When inconsistency, unfairness, and oversight in budget implementation occurs through selective warranting leading to sectors, provinces, and districts missing out on funds, then we must question how on earth the Prime Minister is running the country,” he said. “The country is just too big to be subject to such nefarious tactics and weak leadership.” He said the country has had enough after six years of “this pathetic PANGU-led government, and continued budget failure because of incompetence and the need to serve selfish interests” above the needs of the nation” . “What is happening to Chuave and Simbu are not isolated – it’s happening to other districts, provinces, and sectors. “Members of Parliament must stop pretending,” Nomane said.",Politics,Anger,"James Marape, James Nomane",The National

Marape reaffirms commitment to Icac’s independence,https://www.thenational.com.pg/marape-reaffirms-commitment-to-icacs-independence/,22/10/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has reaffirmed his commitment to the independence of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac), following comments by two suspended deputy commissioners in the media. Suspended deputy commissioners Graham Gill and Daniel Baulch had accused Marape of interfering in the operations of the anti-corruption body. Gill posted on his Linked-In page that he and Baulch were informed by email four months ago by Marape, the chairman of the appointments committee, that they were suspended. But no reason was given for it. However, Marape in a statement yesterday said while every citizen, including senior officers of the law, had the right to express opinions, public forums and media statements were not appropriate avenues for discussing ongoing legal and administrative matters. “As a senior officer of the law, the suspended Deputy Commissioner Daniel Baulch should know that due process must be allowed to take its full course,” he said. “He remains innocent until proven otherwise by the Judicial Tribunal to be established by the Chief Justice.” Marape clarified that the suspension and related proceedings involving the Icac Commissioner and two Deputy Commissioners were conducted strictly under the Organic Law on Icac, the Constitution, and the Organic Law on the Duties and Responsibilities of Leadership. “This is not a political issue or a government decision – it is a matter arising from allegations and counter-allegations among the three senior officers themselves,” he said. An inquiry was conducted by a panel led by the Secretary for the National Judicial Staff Services, with the State Solicitor and the Secretary to the National Executive Council as members. Marape said it was disappointing that the three senior officers of Icac, who were appointed to lead the fight against corruption, were instead engaged in fighting each other. “Two or three years on, instead of fighting corruption, these gentlemen have been fighting among themselves despite the major budgetary support my government has given to Icac,” he said. “So, what do you expect me to do?

"Labour productivity key for long term wage growth, official says",https://www.thenational.com.pg/labour-productivity-key-for-long-term-wage-growth-official-says/,22/10/2025,"LABOUR productivity, the amount of output a worker produces, is an important driver of long term wage growth and improvements in living standards in Papua New Guinea, an academic says. Professor Martin Davies, a visiting lecturer at the University of PNG School of Business and Public Policy, said an increase in labour productivity could lead to businesses being more efficient and paying workers higher wages. “Workers may become more productive through better tools, improved skills or more efficient organisation, better infrastructure and institutions,” he said. “When this happens, businesses can afford to pay higher wages without losing competitiveness. “If wages rise faster than productivity, firms may cut jobs or pass on costs through higher prices. “If productivity rises but wages do not, workers are left behind. “Linking wages to productivity provides a sustainable path to rising incomes and competitiveness.” Davies said based on the “Productivity Study of the Non-Resource Sector in Papua New Guinea, 2001-2024”, which provides an analysis of productivity growth in the formal services, industry and agricultural sectors, policymakers could link wage policy and economic reform to the measure of productivity in the country. He said that the findings from this study also helped to inform the Minimum Wages Board to approve the increase of the country’s minimum wage rate to K5 an hour by Jan 1 next year. He added that the study provided an evidence-based benchmark for policies in minimum wage setting, agricultural reform and improving the current business environment. “With productivity growth averaging 1.5 per cent per year, minimum wages adjusted for inflation can rise in line with this benchmark without undermining competitiveness. “Secondly, stagnant productivity in agriculture reflects structural problems: weak infrastructure, poor market access, low technology adoption and limited investment. “Without reforms, agricultural incomes will continue to lag those in other sectors. “Finally, productivity gains in all sectors are being held back by deteriorating conditions. “Fixing foreign exchange access, utilities, regulation and security issues are critical. “Without these reforms, PNG risks eroding the productivity growth its more dynamic sectors have managed to achieve.”",Business,Anticipation,Nill,The National

The court noted that Mara worked as a cleaner while her late husband, James Paulus, worked as a driver of the National Judicial Staff Service (NJSS).  Judge Miviri when handing down his decision on sentence, said that this was a very serious case of murder committed as depicted by the evidence. “No one should be denied the right to life under section 35 without sanction of the law.

His journey began through a Local Level Government (LLG) programme that distributed rice seeds to ward councillors in Gazelle’s Reimber-Livuan area. His dedication earned him a spot in a Trukai Industries training in Port Moresby last year, which aimed to certify farmers to establish model rice farms. Following the training, Potol’s farm was selected as a model rice farm for East New Britain. He now promotes two main Trukai rice varieties grown in Papua New Guinea (PNG): White Finch (Jasmine), which takes seven months to mature, and Trukai-12, which requires good irrigation and matures in three months. A third variety, Trukai-26, is under trial in Australia. At the Gazelle Agriculture Show, Potol demonstrated rice milling techniques and offered local rice for tasting. He emphasised the benefits of growing Trukai-12 in well-irrigated areas and encouraged other farmers, including cocoa and balsa growers, to make smart agricultural choices. “We want more farmers to grow rice, and hopefully, in time, we can cultivate the Trukai- 26 variety here in PNG,” Potol said. He sells his Trukai-12 rice for K5 and White Finch for K7 per 600 grams. Potol’s two-hectare farm supports Trukai’s push to expand local rice farming, using retained seeds for replanting.

From this, the current ratio is one correctional warder to 20 prisoners and less for less populated prisons, further posing risks with ailing infrastructure, less CS personnel and other issues.

Speaking on Sunday at the opening and handover of three new staff houses – each vauled at K700,000 – at the Hope Institute in Tari, he said material possessions such as money and wealth come and go. Marape said education remained the key to a better future and should always be every parent’s top priority. “Our plan and aim are to give hope to the children,” he said. “They must feel that they are valued and that they can continue to learn and improve their lives through the formal education system.” Marape thanked Hela Governor Philip Undialu and the Hela government for supporting the Hope Institute, describing it as a “second-chance school” for students who had completed grades eight, 10 and 12 but were unable to progress to secondary or tertiary institutions. He said the school was once located on swampy land, but it had been drained and rehabilitated for new infrastructure. “The decision by Governor Undialu and his education division is highly valued and appreciated,” Marape said. “Thank you for giving us the three staff houses to accommodate our hardworking teachers who are shaping the next generation of good citizens.” Marape noted that the original school buildings were damaged by a major earthquake, and development had been delayed by landownership issues. This has now been resolved, with the land placed under State ownership and managed by the district and institute. Upgrading facilities and buildings for the future with these challenges resolved, construction will now proceed on new classrooms and staff housing, including a four-in-one double classroom funded by the Hela government. Because the site sits on reclaimed swamp, all future classrooms will feature reinforced concrete foundations to withstand seismic activity. Marape also announced plans to elevate Pai Hope Institute to university status through the establishment of Hope Polytechnic College, catering for grades 10 and 12 graduates. “Dreams start small, and already there is a big ray of hope at Hope Institute,” Marape said. “That is my dream for Tari-Pori and Hela – to give hope to our children.” Marape said the Hope Institute and Hope Polytechnic should uphold discipline and moral values. “We want our schools to be betel nut and smoke-free,” he said. “Teachers and staff must be role models.”",Education,Trust,James Marape,The National

‘Black flight’ smugglers jailed over AU$17m drug plot,https://www.thenational.com.pg/black-flight-smugglers-jailed-over-au17m-drug-plot/,21/10/2025,"Brisbane: Two members of a “black flight” drug syndicate that smuggled AU$17 million (about K47m) worth of methamphetamine into Australia from Papua New Guinea have been jailed. The smugglers masterminded a scheme to fly a twin-engine Beechcraft aircraft to the historic gold mining town of Bulolo in the mountain ranges of Papua New Guinea’s Morobe. Two men piloted the unauthorised flight from regional town of Monto, northwest of Brisbane, to Bulolo. After landing safely at the PNG airstrip, they loaded five duffel bags packed with methamphetamine. Inside were 87 plastic bags containing a white crystalline substance weighing 71.5kg. Testing later revealed the pure weight of the drugs was 56.98kg. The men are alleged to have collected the meth and concealed it in the plane’s nose cone before embarking on a “black flight” return to Australia – flying at low altitude with the transponder off in a bid not to be detected. The cargo was bound for NSW, but when the return leg of the flight touched down in Monto on March 21, 2023 to refuel, the authorities were waiting. Two of the five smugglers – co-pilot John Otto Horvath, 55, and 57-year-old Peter David Payne who provided ground support – pleaded guilty to a single charge of importing a commercial quantity of drugs in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Tuesday. Two other syndicate members have previously been sentenced for their part in the elaborate scheme. Justice Rebecca Treston said Horvath and Payne were far from the top of the syndicate hierarchy and had no idea of the quantity of the drugs the smugglers were bringing into Australia. “I accept you did not finance any aspect of the importation nor were you particularly instrumental in the organisation of it.” Horvath was recruited for his piloting skills and stood to gain a slice of the profits. “You had a significant role in the actual movement of the importation of the drugs,” Justice Treston said. “I accept you did not recruit anyone to the venture, and were in fact recruited yourself. “But you helped fly the plane both to Papua New Guinea, allowed the collection of the drugs onto the plane, and then flew the plane back to Monto.” Payne lives next door to another of the smugglers and failed to grasp the extent of the importation plot. “However, your conduct was more than objectively reckless, especially when you became aware of the true nature of the importation,” Justice Treston said. Payne did not hide his movements, used his own car to transport the fuel and even booked accommodation in his own name. “It’s probably best described as logistical support … both of you were to receive a financial reward from your involvement in the drugs being imported into this country,” Justice Treston said. Horvath was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 10 years. Payne was handed a lesser sentence of eight years and will be eligible for release after five years.

Suspended Icac deputy commissioners take aim at PM,https://www.thenational.com.pg/suspended-icac-deputy-commissioners-take-aim-at-pm/,21/10/2025,"TWO suspended deputy commissioners of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) have taken direct aim at Prime Minister James Marape and accused him of interfering in the operations of the anti-corruption body. Graham Gill posted on his Linked-In page that both he and Daniel Baulch had been informed by email four months ago by Marape, the chairman of the appointments committee, that they were suspended. But no reason was given for it. Gill said: “In 2023 I took up the role of deputy commissioner with the Icac in PNG with the best intentions of making a difference, helping the people of PNG to fight the scourge of corruption and having taken the assurances from (Marape) at face value. “While I knew the work would be difficult, I never expected things to blow up in my face, quite as they did! “There have been many lessons about personal integrity – importantly how you have to set and live by your own standards and, sadly, how others don’t. “It is now four months since my fellow deputy commissioner Daniel Baulch and I were suspended by the appointments committee led by the Prime Minister (for those of you outside PNG, the Appointments Committee is the administrative body that appoints the Icac commissioners). “Neither deputy commissioner have at any time been provided with the reasons for the suspension – we just received a suspension notice by email (yes true!). I am as much in the dark now as I was four months ago. “This is an ‘unusual’ position to be in personally but as a PNG Constitution Office Holder it is quite outrageous and unlawful. “As time goes on, it is very clear that this is just action with a smokescreen of credibility to sideline the deputy commissioners at a point when we were starting to ask serious questions about corruption by politicians. Information from confidential sources supports this.” They said they were whistle blowers to alleged corruption within the office of Icac but the appointments committee failed to act properly. They and certain officers were “subjected to a vendetta of retaliatory actions – including fabricated complaints that provided the substance for our suspension”. “This whole affair sends a very poor message to potential whistleblowers in PNG. Do so at your own peril,” Gill said. “If the head of the Government can sideline the leaders of the supposed cornerstone in the fight against corruption in PNG, what does it say about the political will to change? “Serious questions need to be asked and answered. The people of PNG should not put up with the usual placatory, evasive statements from those in power. “Transparency and accountability are the foundations of integrity. PNG deserves better.”",Politics,Anger,James Marape,The National

Communication devices for villages along Frieda Project zone,https://www.thenational.com.pg/communication-devices-for-villages-along-frieda-project-zone/,21/10/2025,"SEVEN villages in the Frieda Copper Gold Project zone have been equipped with communication devices for emergency and development purposes, says a project worker. Frieda River Limited (FRL) community affairs supervisor John Ramit said seven radios had been installed in the communities against weekly schedules set for Monday, Wednesday and Fridays where regular checks are made on the villages. “This is to update the communities on the project and mostly for any medivacs. They communicate to base and upon their information sent through, we send it to the medical team to assess before we dispatch a helicopter to assist them,” he said. He said the village areas do not have mobile network and rely heavily on the radio transmitter for communication. The Frieda project lies on the political boundaries of East and West Sepik, with Paupe the only village in Ambunti Dreikikier and Wabia, Ok Isai, Wameimin One and Two, Sokamin and Amaromin in Telefomin, West Sepik. In the past, villagers have had to track for days for emergency or to relay messages. All the villages in Telefomin are scattered and takes hours or up to a day to reach the next village. The only village that is close to the Frieda River airstrip camp is Paupe in East Sepik. FRL country manager Dr Joel Hamago said FRL covered the full cost on maintenance and licensing fees. “We cover the costs because it’s the lifeline of the communities, they don’t have mobile phones so if they don’t talk to us and if something happens, they have to walk for days to get to Telefomin or the nearest village for help,” he said. “They can also communicate among themselves too, and not necessarily for the project but for their own well-being as well.” Hamago said costs have increased over the years, along with the added cost of doing business and development insurmountable and therefore encouraged the villagers to take care of the radio transmitters.",Development,Trust,Nill,The National
"Minimum wage increase targets low income earners, says chair",https://www.thenational.com.pg/minimum-wage-increase-targets-low-income-earners-says-chair/,21/10/2025,"THE minimum wage rate increase from K3.50 to K5 an hour aims to help minimum wage earners keep up with the rising cost of living in the country, an official says. Minimum Wages Board chairman Beverly Doiwa said the new minimum wage rate would address issues faced by low-income earners and persons unemployed, urging that it would act as threshold that wages should not drop below. The board’s determination, as gazetted on Sept 8, sets the national minimum wage rate at K5 an hour from Jan 1 next year, followed by a staggered increase to K5.25 in January 2027, and then to K5.50 in January 2028. Doiwa said that the determination would apply to all employers and employees in compliance with the Employment Act, adding that a minimum wage earner was defined as an unskilled worker aged 16 and over in formal employment in any industry or sector located in either an urban or rural setting. “The new rate is aimed at addressing the rising cost of living in the country, especially for low-income earners,” she said. “The new rate has been considered against many economic indicators of the country. “During our consultations throughout last year and this year, we heard of different rates but could only settle on one that would be manageable by most employers. “The new rate is to act as safeguard for all minimum wage earners, especially those that are unskilled and joining the workforce for the first time.” She urged all employers to implement the new minimum wage rate as outlined by the board’s determination for the next three years. “The determination has been in operation since the date of publication in the National Gazette and employers can start paying their workers on the new rate,” she said. “By the Jan 1, 2026, the national minimum wage rate shall be K5 an hour. “Twelve months from the date of publication in the National Gazette, the national minimum wage shall increase to K5.25 an hour. “Twenty-four months from the date of publication in the National Gazette, the national minimum wage shall increase to K5.50 an hour. “We need to work together to ensure that the minimum wage rate is enforced, especially when the new rate comes into effect for all by next year.”",Business,Anticipation,Nill,The National

WHO Western Pacific Director Dr Saia Ma’u Piukala, in his address at the opening of the 76th session of the regional committee of the Western Pacific yesterday in Nadi, Fiji, acknowledged PNG’s efforts. “Fiji and PNG have eliminated trachoma as a public health problem. These victories remind us that diseases of poverty and vulnerability can be defeated when evidence, commitment and community converge,” Piukala told the 38 member states. “But achieving UHC (universal health coverage), means tackling the deeper drivers of health system effectiveness — such as antimicrobial resistance or AMR. “This year, we saw strong momentum: Papua New Guinea and the Philippines strengthened their national AMR guidelines and plans. “Despite global funding challenges, our region is pushing forward on the unfinished agenda of communicable diseases: Papua New Guinea, screened 79 per cent of its target population, for neglected tropical diseases. “While physician and nurse numbers have improved, pharmacist density, remains low. Cambodia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, developed long-term workforce strategies. “Laboratory capacity is the cornerstone of effective outbreak response. “Today, only 15 countries in our region have in-country sequencing capabilities. “Laboratories in Papua New Guinea, and seven other countries, are being trained in sequencing, by Australia’s Centre for Pathogen Genomics, to establish and strengthen, end-to-end genomic surveillance capacities. “PNG (has also), developed its National Digital Health Strategy (2025–2030), aligning with global frameworks, and incorporating inputs, from national and local stakeholders. In response, Health Minister Elias Kapavore extended appreciation to WHO for support in addressing several positive health outcomes. “Papua New Guinea particularly values WHO’s technical and operational support in our efforts to eliminate trachoma, a preventable cause of blindness, and in building national laboratory capacity, including the training of PNG laboratory teams to enhance diagnostics, surveillance, and preparedness for emerging health threats,” Kapavore said. Kapavore told the meeting that as part of the country’s continued commitment to public health, in May this year, the Government took decisive action to ban the sale of e-cigarettes, marking an important milestone in tobacco control and a strong step to prevent new forms of addiction among the young people. “PNG remains committed to the regional priorities highlighted in the report strengthening One Health collaboration, building climate-resilient health systems, and promoting equity in health service delivery across all provinces,” Kapavore said. “As we look ahead, we reaffirm our commitment to working closely with WHO and member states to advance Universal Health Coverage, health security, and resilient health systems, ensuring that no one in our region is left behind,” Kapavore added.",Health,Trust,Elias Kapavore,The National

Marape made the remarks following reports from the Health Department showing significant drug wastage at the Milne Bay Provincial Transit Store, where more than K236,000 worth – or 63 per cent – of medical supplies had expired due to a lack of oversight and stock control. The issue was identified through the MSupply electronic monitoring system, which tracks pharmaceutical stock movements nationwide. Data revealed that the Milne Bay Transit Store had recorded no stock audits or orders for over a month, resulting in critical inefficiencies and wastage. “The data clearly shows a lack of responsibility and accountability by the store management,” Marape said. “When public officers fail to perform their duties diligently, they are directly compromising the health and lives of our people. This is unacceptable.” Marape reaffirmed his government’s commitment to improving transparency, performance, and accountability in the delivery of essential health services, especially under the provincial health authority (PHA) system. “I commend the health minister and the department for closely monitoring the system in real time,” Marape said. “This digital oversight allows us to act swiftly. Warning letters and disciplinary measures, including termination of underperforming officers, will be enforced where negligence is proven.” He urged all PHA chief executive officers and provincial store managers to ensure strict compliance with reporting protocols, stock audits and timely ordering through the MSupply system. “Our government continues to invest heavily in the health sector.

MRDC’s managing director Augustine Mano said with ExxonMobil agreeing to provide gas for up to 5MW of power, landowners from the licence area in Hides, Tari town, its surrounds and other districts of Hela will benefit from the cheapest power in PNG. “This has been the dream of our leaders like late Anderson Agiru, and Prime Minister James Marape (then Finance minister) when they signed the PNG LNG Gas Agreement in 2009,” he said. “It has taken a while to deliver because we had to negotiate. But it is finally a reality and I want to thank the leaders involved, and the landowners and Hela people for being patient. “Through power, places change, development happens through investments. Hela will get the cheapest power in all of PNG and it’s reliable. There will be no blackouts,” Mano said.

You are a shining example of how mining in PNG can be done responsibly and profitably.” Marape noted that K92 Mining had paid more than K500 million in taxes in 2024 and 2025 alone, contributing significantly to the national treasury through both corporate and personal income taxes. He commended the company’s transparency through the Mineral Resources Authority’s new digital monitoring system, which tracks production and revenue in real time — a first in PNG’s history. “K92 Mine is a benchmark for how mining companies should operate — transparent, efficient, and respectful of landowners and the State,” Marape said. “You are not just mining gold; you are building trust.” Marape also encouraged greater local participation in spin-off businesses, employment, and procurement. Marape expressed confidence in the future of the gold industry, predicting continued strong demand and high prices. “I said three years ago that gold would hit US$5,000 per ounce, and I stand by that prediction. “Gold remains the safest store of value, and PNG will continue to benefit as long as we maintain good governance and investor confidence,” he said.

Australian defence deal to train PNG troops a ‘win-win’,https://www.thenational.com.pg/australian-defence-deal-to-train-png-troops-a-win-win/,20/10/2025,"Canberra: Thousands of Papua New Guineans will be eligible to join the Australian Defence Force within months. A specialist taskforce to recruit PNG citizens will be set up, with as many as 10,000 Papua New Guineans tipped to join the Australian Defence Force, including infantrymen and medics. PNG permanent residents in Australia will be eligible to join the defence force from January. The taskforce was set up as part of the landmark Pukpuk treaty signed by the neighbouring nations two weeks ago, with Australia making multi-million dollar pledges to strengthen Papua New Guinea’s defence capabilities. Acting Prime Minister Richard Marles, Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Pacific Affairs Minister Pat Conroy announced funding for facilities, training and weapons alongside a delegation of PNG ministers in Canberra during the first ministerial forum between the two countries since the treaty was signed. “Today’s ministerial forum is very much around operationalising the alliance which we have just formed,” Marles said. The recruitment taskforce is set to have its first meeting this year. “They will be members of the ADF, so there will be no coaching going on from Papua New Guinea Defence Force,” PNG Defence Minister Billy Joseph told reporters. Deputy PNG Prime Minister John Russo called it a “win-win on both sides” as it enhances Australia’s defence capabilities while providing jobs to young Papua New Guineans. Australia will also provide AU$7.7 million (about K21m) to fund the construction of a 200-bed facility at the Goldie River Barracks in PNG and AU$2.2m (about K6.1mi) to design barracks in Hela. “This will enable an additional 200 soldiers to be trained each and every year into the PNG,” Marles said. “We’re also announcing that beginning next year, we will be training six PNG pilots each year to build (air crew) capacity.” Marles said 3,500 rifles will be provided to the PNG defence force over the next four years. An education and skills package worth over AU$150m (about K4.6m) will be delivered to support PNG’s “productivity, economic growth and human development” as well as a AU$25m (about K69m) humanitarian aid disaster package. Among the defence initiatives, Conroy added that Australia was the largest trade and investment partner for the PNG, labelling new NRL team the PNG Chiefs as a key economic partnership. “I can’t wait to see them getting on the field in 2028 and they’ll soon dominate the competition,” Conroy said. The pact means PNG joins the United States and New Zealand as the third defence ally of Australia, and the newest in 70 years. The signing of the Pukpuk treaty, named after the PNG word for crocodile, followed a botched attempt in Port Moresby in September, dashing hopes the trans-Torres treaty would be confirmed alongside PNG celebrating its 50th anniversary of independence.

Rosso warns settlers to respect eviction notice,https://www.thenational.com.pg/rosso-warns-settlers-to-respect-eviction-notice/,20/10/2025,"LAE MP John Rosso has warned settlers of Three-Mile in Lae who were served eviction notices recently to abide by the law. Rosso addressed people in Ward Four of Three-Mile on Saturday, exercising his powers as the Lands Minister to acquire portions of land there to allow people to remain. “This action has been taken in the interest of the wider public and to safeguard stability within our community,” he added. He said the eviction that was supposed to occur was instigated by the Fresh Produce Development Agency (FPDA) who own the land. “They are entitled to pursue their rights through the courts, and I respect that legal process,” Rosso said. He told the people that the land was compulsory acquired using the power he has as the Lands Minister, but the matter will be fought out in court. Rosso said that the Lands Department would negotiate with the FPDA to find a solution which respected its legal interests while addressing the humanitarian concerns of the people. “This eviction will stop, but the matter is taken to court now, which will be battled (between) the Lands Department and the FPDA,” he stated. Rosso warned settlers not to start ethnic clashes, sorcery-related killings, drunk and disorder behaviour, and petty crimes to disturb the peace. “I don’t like petty crimes to be practised here and along the highway,” he added. “If any misbehaviour happens, then I will evict you because we have all left our villages looking for better opportunities and lifestyle in town areas. “People who move to Lae must abide by our city’s laws and regulations, respect their fellow citizens, and live peacefully.”",Politics,Trust,John Rosso,The National
Marape upbeat about Hela gas-fired power project,https://www.thenational.com.pg/marape-upbeat-about-hela-gas-fired-power-project/,20/10/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has commended PNG Power Limited, ExxonMobil PNG and the Hela government for a gas-fired power project that will provide electricity to Hela and parts of Southern Highlands. The new facility at Hides will supply five megawatts of power, with infrastructure work – including generation and transmission – now nearing completion. It will light up Komo, Koroba, Kopiago, Pori, Tari, Magarima, Nipa, Mendi, and Kandep. “This project is deeply personal to me,” Marape said. “I have lived and worked in this electorate since 1994, and I have seen the power lines pass over our heads to supply Porgera, while Tari and the Hela Basin remained in darkness.” “To see power finally coming to our people fulfills one of the reasons that drove me to politics in 2002.” Marape described the achievement as “prophetic,” noting that it aligns with the traditional Hela prophecy that “the gas from Hides would one day light up the world”. He praised ExxonMobil for being a responsible and committed corporate partner in the development of Hela and Southern Highlands, and PNG Power for ensuring that the energy generated is affordable and accessible. “This is not just about lighting homes – it’s about lighting opportunities,” Marape said. “With power now coming into Hela, our people can venture into agriculture, small-medium enterprises, and tourism. “This electricity project will be an incubator for local growth and development.” The Hela gas-fired power project complements the 132-kilovolt transmission line being developed to connect Hides to Yonki and onward to Lae. It will form part of PNG’s national grid transformation programme. Marape revealed that the project had generated more than K32 billion in revenue to date, K15 billion collected by the Government in taxes, K11 billion in dividend earnings through the Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited and K3 billion to K4 billion for landowners, pending the resolution of legal processes. “PNG LNG has been a cornerstone of our national revenue base over the past decade, and now it is fitting that it is giving back directly to the province where it all began – by providing power from Hides to light up Hela,” Marape said.",Energy,Joy,James Marape,The National

Special masses to celebrate PNG’s first saint,https://www.thenational.com.pg/special-masses-to-celebrate-pngs-first-saint/,20/10/2025,"CATHOLICS around the country held special masses to honour Blessed Peter ToRot’s historic canonisation as Papua New Guinea’s first saint. The Mary Queen of the Pacific (MQP) parish in Waigani, Port Moresby, held a mass to commemorate his life, martyrdom and canonisation yesterday. The mass was led by main celebrant Fr Francis Tilo, MSC, and Fr Joseph Amith. During his homily, Fr Francis emphasised the importance of prayer. “The readings of today has reminded us to grow our faith in God,” he said. “The Gospel of Luke talks about the parable of the persistent widow and the unjust judge, emphasizing the importance of perseverance in prayer.” Fr Francis said that prayer was also Torot’s tool which helped maintain his faith. “Let us offer this mass in honour of him, and to pray together that we will maintain the habit of praying daily.” ToRot was canonised by Pope Leo XIV yesterday with six others – Ignatius Maloyan from Armenia, Carmen Martinez from Venezuela, Maria Troncatti from Italy, Vincenza Poloni from Italy, Jose Hernandez from Venezuela and Bartolo Longo of Italy. In East New Britain, parishioners gathered for a three-day prayer pilgrimage to Rakunai, ToRot’s place of birth and where his burial site is. Parish members from Pomio, Kokopo and Rabaul met in Kokopo for a thanksgiving mass before making the journey. The pilgrimage started yesterday and will continue tomorrow. Rabaul Archdiocese Archbishop Rochus Tatamai, before leaving for Rome, said the combined programme was to celebrate the country’s first saint. “In celebrating the work and life of the catechist, though long gone but for us the programme facilitates in the jubilee year, that we are called to journey together in hope,” he said.

"Canonisation seen as a symbol of hope, resilience",https://www.thenational.com.pg/canonisation-seen-as-a-symbol-of-hope-resilience/,20/10/2025,"THE canonisation of Peter ToRot is a symbol of hope and resilience for Papua New Guinea, says Archbishop Rochus Tatamai. “Peter ToRot’s story is not just my family’s story, it belongs to the whole of Papua New Guinea,” Archbishop Rochus told theVatican News. A Canonisation process by which the Catholic Church declares a deceased person a saint, making them worthy of public veneration and adding their name to the church’s official list of saints. “He stood firm in faith at a time when our people were under immense pressure. His witness, simple but profound, he refused to abandon God, his family, or his community and continues to inspire us,” Bishop Rochus said. In a separate interview with Vatican News, Fr Tomas Ravaioli, vice-postulator of the Cause of Canonisation, attested that “people are excited with the canonisation of Peter ToRot not only an exterior preparation, but an interior one. “Everybody is praying through his intercession, and at the end of the Mass, many people come for confession. His canonisation has brought renewal in the Church of Papua New Guinea,” Fr Thomas said. “Our Melanesian brother showed that holiness is possible in ordinary family life. He lived the Gospel as a lay person, and that makes his example accessible to the majority of our people,” Fr Thomas said. Sr Daisy Lisania, the secretary of the Social Communications Commission the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of PNG and the Solomon Islands said: “Rakunai (in East New Britain) is where he grew up and was formed, a place forms you to be who you are because of the context of the surroundings and the faith formation.” Sr Daisy had visited Rakunai village, where Peter ToRot was born. She added: “In the Shrine of Blessed Peter ToRot lies his remains, well kept in a wooden box. The atmosphere is quiet and peaceful, and there are children who visit the sacred place from the nearby school during their break to pray always.” Peter ToRot’s father was the head of the community, one of the first to be baptised in his village, and he donated the land for the construction of the church, the school and the mission house. His generosity and witness of faith had an impact on his people, leading to a radical transformation, replacing constant fighting, and witchcraft with a more cohesive, peaceful society whose life began to revolve around the school, the medical clinic and the Church. What is still called “the mission” today. Archbishop Rochus echoed these sentiments. “ToRot’s legacy is visible in the life of the Church in Rakunai and across the nation. Pilgrims visit his grave, families gather for prayer inspired by his witness, and catechists see in him the model of their vocation.” He quietly but courageously continued to teach catechism, organise prayer and defend the dignity of marriage, which led to his martyrdom through execution by Japanese soldiers in 1945 during World War II. “He was not a priest, or a bishop,” Archbishop Rochus said. “He was a layman, a father, a husband. That is why his life resonates so deeply. “People see in him the possibility of holiness in everyday life.” Fr Thomas reiterates Pope Francis’ words: “This is the saint the Church needs in these times.” Peter ToRot’s life bridges local culture and universal faith as a catechist. Peter ToRot’s faith was closely linked to his sincere friendship with the missionaries of the Sacred Heart. This relationship was based on missionary work that today is described as a “shared mission.” It was a collaborative effort between religious men and women and the laity of Christian communities. “The event of canonisation will be far more than a Church celebration,” Archbishop Rochus said. “It will be a blessing for the whole country, reminding us that society itself depends on the strength of families, it’s a gift to our country as a national revolutionary that calls us to holiness that begins in the family and extends to the whole society. “He was known for humility, service to the poor, devotion to prayer and respect for elders. “He challenges every one of us to live lives of service and generosity, ToRot’s story offers practical guidance.”",Religion,Joy,Nill,The National
Parliament should accept Bougainville referendum result in ‘original form’,https://www.thenational.com.pg/parliament-should-accept-bougainville-referendum-result-in-original-form/,20/10/2025,"THE Bougainville Referendum must be accepted in its original form by parliament, former Internal Security Minister Bire Kimisopa says. He cautioned that if Parliament denies the referendum, every MP should go to Bougainville and apologise to every Bougainvillian from the youngest to the oldest. ‘’It’s nearly 40 years gone after the crisis, children born during the crisis have not gone to school, we offered no help in humanitarian needs nor did the Government ran to its rescue,” he said. Kimisopa told members of the Parliamentary Bipartisan Committee on Bougainville Matters during its Highlands regional consultative forum in Goroka on Friday that what he raised was his personal thoughts. He said Bougainvillians will not suddenly deviate from PNG, it will remain as it follows the processes to become a fully-fledged independent country. He said Parliament should not procrastinate, it should accept the result of the Bougainville referendum in its original form. Kimisopa said the referendum result of 97.7 per cent of Bougainvilleans wanting independence and 2.3 per cent preferring   greater autonomy showed their position. He said PNG today has many unresolved issues “because of our insensitivity to manage such issues”. “Today, PNG is different, so fractured because it has too many provinces to run, some provinces get a lot of money, while some of us get peanuts. “It goes for Bougainville as well when your attitude is like this, how do you expect them to cooperate?” He said the buck stopped with Parliament, if Bougainville must behave there should be equity in everything. “Bougainville is an integral part of PNG, deserving love and respect. With only one copper mine in Bougainville, it served PNG well. “Forty per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) comes from Bougainville, 40 toea in every K1 comes from Bougainville copper, it makes sure health and education services are operational, we get a lot services from the mine,” Kimisopa said.

Marape directs department to lead consultation with landowners,https://www.thenational.com.pg/marape-directs-department-to-lead-consultation-with-landowners/,20/10/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has directed the Department of Mining to return to Kainantu and lead consultations with landowners, the Eastern Highlands government, and district leaders to strengthen the structure of landowner and provincial government benefits in the mining sector. “The Government will take a submission to cabinet to review and strengthen how landowner and provincial government benefits are structured under our mining framework,” he said. “As a Pangu-led Government, we remain firmly pro-landowner and pro-provincial government. “Those who host mining projects must share equitably in the wealth generated from their land.” Marape said that under Pangu’s policy, 40 per cent of any equity gained by the national government in a project is passed back to provincial governments and landowners of the mining areas. “In this context, the current memorandum of agreement (MoA) for the K92 Mine will be revisited to ensure fair and transparent benefit-sharing,” he said. He announced that a high-level interagency team led by the Department of Mining will be assembled to address outstanding land disputes and legacy issues, and to facilitate open dialogue with all stakeholders. “We must sit down together – landowners, provincial government, district, company, and national government – to find a meeting point where no one is offended,” he said. “As a country that operates under the rule of law, we must never take our disputes to the streets or the bush. The law protects us all.” Marape drew comparisons with the PNG LNG Project, where billions of kina remain tied up in court disputes, and urged local leaders to prioritise mediation and collaboration. “We have learned from the LNG experience that court battles only delay benefits,” he said. “Dialogue and consensus will ensure that the people receive what is rightfully theirs.” Marape also said Cabinet will soon consider a submission to provide special recognition and benefits to Eastern Highlands, which he said deserved acknowledgment for hosting one of the country’s most efficient and transparent mining operations. “Eastern Highlands is paying huge tax revenues through this mine and deserves due respect from the national government,” he said. “This will be reflected in future cabinet decisions on mining and petroleum benefit distribution.” Marape commended governor Simon Sia, Kainantu MP William Hagahuno, and Henganofi MP Robert Atiyafa for their leadership and constructive engagement, and thanked Australian High Commissioner Ewen McDonald for his continued support to PNG’s mining and governance sector.",Politics,Trust,"James Marape, Robert Atiyafa, William Hagahuno",The National

The project, located in the Leron-Wantoat Local Level Government (LLG) area, was counter-funded by local family support and the Brian Bell Foundation. Of the total cost, K241,000 was contributed by Neritha Gengewe Ganzik and her family, while the Brian Bell Foundation supported the project with K9,000. Ganzik, who is also the president of the Leron-Wantoat Women’s Association, said the deteriorating Leron-Wantoat road, left in poor condition for the past eight years, has made it difficult for essential services to reach the area. “But luckily we were able to deliver all the materials with only 25 runs which is a big sacrifice by my family to give back to our community.” She said the counter-fund from Brian Bell Foundation was taken from an earmarked K29,000 for the construction of the Women’s Resource centre. She said the rest of the money (K20,000) is kept to build the resource center. Morobe Provincial Health Authority (PHA) chief executive officer Dr Kipas Binga opened the new Bumbum Aid-post in Wantoat Station, 66 kilometers from the Okuk Highway, marking a major upgrade for local healthcare services. The old aid-post, built in the 1980s on short stilts with concrete floors, was demolished due to disrepair. In 2012, the community constructed a new aid-post, but roof damage from a fallen tree forced them to rely on a temporary clinic until now. Binga noted that an additional health worker was added to Wantoat Aid-post as part of Morobe PHA’s restructuring.

August said the induction of ward member elect is a programme that is normally conducted after every LLG elections, aimed at educating them on their roles and responsibilities. The next programme, relating to ward recorders’ recruitment, is only just being introduced this year. August said that ward recorders in ENB currently receive monthly allowances from the ENB government through the divisions of finance and revenue and LLG and ward affairs. August who is also adviser for ENB division for the human resource management under the provincial administration said the ward recorder appointment is important, because the officer is responsible for the administrative functions of the ward. This is to complement the election of the ward members. “Unlike past practices where the ward member appoints a ward recorder, we see that it is better that the people themselves appoint the ward recorder through a fair process,” August said. She said the appointment process will see elected ward members conduct a ward government meeting to call for nominations from the people. There can be up to five nominees per ward and once the nominations are done, all names are submitted to their respective LLG administrations for screening by a selection committee. This programme is aimed at strengthening the administrative operations of the ward governance under the provincial government’s ward focus policy.

Led by Nawaeb Development Authority (DDA) chairman and local MP Theo Pelgen, this long-awaited project aims to provide access to vital infrastructure for the people of Lowai and Finongang, who had been cut off for over 10 years. The road, which had been neglected for nearly 49 years, limited families and farmers’ access to basic services and markets. Pelgen expressed his commitment to improving infrastructure across Nawaeb. “For too long, our people in Lowai and Finongang have been left behind,” he said. The road is not just a physical connection but a symbol of restored hope and opportunity, Pelgen said. As construction began, many residents, especially mothers, expressed joy, knowing they could now access services easily. The new road is expected to provide critical access for coffee farmers, fresh produce traders, schoolchildren, health workers, and local traders.

This trail, which was used by American soldiers in 1942, is the second-largest tourism trekking route in the region, following the famous Kokoda Track. The reopening aims to attract both international and local trekkers, boosting the province’s economy. Rigo MP Sir Ano Pala highlighted the village’s key role in WWII, where it assisted American soldiers on the frontlines. Now, Gabagaba will once again take the frontline, but this time for peace, leading visitors along the 48km trail southeast to the Kokoda Track. This initiative not only honors the historical significance of the site but also promotes tourism and economic growth in the region. “As we launched the Ghost Mountain Legacy Track, the revisit of the Kapa Kapa Trail, let us be reminded of our needs and our leaders must stand together to bring all our needs as basic services,” Sir Ano said. The Ghost Mountain Expedition name was initiated by the PNG Tribal Foundation, with support from Central Governor Rufina Peter and Sir Ano. This initiative is set to boost tourism and improve basic services, including schools, aid posts, and electricity, in remote villages along the WWII trail. These villages, starting from Dorobisoro and its neighboring areas, were vital during the war when locals assisted soldiers in battle.

The incident on Pik Island saw more than 20 students from Kusbau Primary School unable to make it back to Madang after a picnic because the boat had failed to return to pick them up. It was also alleged that students, many of them minors, drank homebrew (steam) on the island. “For the safety of the children, it is better to have all such gatherings within the school premises rather than taking it out and risking the lives of the children,” Baim said. He said when having such gatherings in the school grounds can be supervised well by both the parents and teachers. “From now on, students must return directly home after all official school programmes and not engage in any other unofficial school programmes like end of year parties.” As the year’s end approaches, many students who finish their exams will try to make their class party to say goodbye to their friends.

At the recent launch of the Bulolo-Wau Plantation Extension Project, Bulolo MP Sam Basil Jr called on government agencies to help his district start small-scale tree planting, especially through community nurseries. He said Bulolo already had successful small farmers growing cocoa and coffee, and now it was time to add trees to that list. “This is about giving our people the tools to help themselves,” Basil said. “With the help of the National Forest Authority and PNG Diwai Holdings, we can provide tree seedlings and support so individuals and families can plant trees on their own land.” Basil believes this project will not only help the environment but also create income opportunities for local families. He stressed that long-term investment in tree planting could provide economic benefits just like cash crops. National Forest Services managing director John Mosoro said the idea fitted well with the current extension of the Bulolo-Wau plantation. He said planting materials and land would be made available, but it was important that the district worked with local landowners to ensure land was ready. Mosoro said: “This is not just a government project, it’s a chance for the whole community to be involved in sustainable forestry.” The Bulolo-Wau plantation is one of the oldest and best-managed forest areas in PNG. First established in 1962, it now covers thousands of hectares and is divided into zones to manage planting and harvesting. To support the expansion, two vehicles and staff housing were also launched during the event, which shows that the project has both planning and resources behind it. Basil encouraged all people in Bulolo to support the tree planting initiative, and said that it was a long-term investment in the land, the people, and the future of the district.",Environment,Joy,Sam Basil,The National

About 100 ADF personnel and four CH-47F Chinook helicopters have conducted daily flights around the Owen Stanley Ranges as part of Exercise Helicon Luk 2025, an annual activity aimed at getting pilots and aircrew qualified to fly at altitude and in mountainous terrain. Captain Lloyd Struber said being qualified to fly at high-density altitude and in mountainous environments was necessary to prepare the unit to operate in all conditions and in all terrain. “The aircraft behaves differently at higher-density altitudes because the air is thinner, you’re using more power but creating less lift, and if we’re to go out the door on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, or defence aid to the civil community, or combat missions, we have to be able to fly everywhere,” he said. At Townsville in North Queensland, where the fifth Aviation Regiment typically trains, the highest peak is around 1,700 feet or 518 metres.

Wai was responding to questions during the Special Parliamentary Committee on Children and Youth on the cause of low immunisation coverage in some provinces. The inquiry into social services for children and youths began yesterday in Port Moresby. “The Health Department with partners like Unicef are supplying cold chains (vaccine freezers), vaccines and even transporting the vaccines to provinces to carry out the immunisation,” he said. “But it’s the health facilities and provincial health authorities (PHAs) who do not do clinics.” Wai added that while the department coordinated the overall health system, the PHAs were given powers to execute service delivery including human resources, facilities and funding. Health Department’s population and healthy community acting executive manager Dr Lutty Amos said that they identified during visits the lack of leadership and communication by provincial heads right down to the village level. It was one of the contributing factors to the low immunisation coverage. She added that logistical issues also affected the rollout of vaccines. “For instance, in Mutzing, Morobe, the health facility there has only one vehicle to help with the daily operations,” Dr Amos said. “It cannot go out to help with the immunisation programme.” She said that they were identifying problems and were working with PHAs to address them.

Marum said the operation was a joint effort by the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) explosive ordnance disposal unit, provincial disaster management division, Kokopo Fire Service, police, Rabaul’s Kombiu local level government officers, local contractor Kokopo Plant Hire and volunteers. Marum said the bomb was accidentally unearthed on Sept 25 by a group of youths digging a pit toilet, sparking fear throughout surrounding villages. It was later confirmed to be a 2,000-pound AN-M66 bomb, a type widely used by Allied Forces during World War Two. Rabaul was one of the Japan’s major military bases during the war. To neutralise it, the US carried out massive bombing campaigns, leaving behind hundreds of unexploded ordnances still being found across the province, Marum said. Retired PNGDF bomb specialist Philip Makoan, now attached to the provincial disaster office, praised the joint effort.",Danger,Fear,Nill,The National

Provincial police commander Supt Mazuc Rubiang made clear following the arrest of 18 Grade 10 male students from various high schools and secondary schools following reports of disorderly behaviour after the exams. Rubiang said the students were taken into custody in Kundiawa over the weekend and were now facing charges related to alcohol and public disturbances. “I have directed my officers to go through each and every one of them by fingerprints and photographs and update their criminal records,” he said. He added that students must understand that in any further studies or employment, they will be required to provide police clearance and such records would stop their future opportunities. “The students were arrested following my directives to Grades eight, 10 and 12 students not to misbehave after their final examinations,” he said. Rubiang had warned that students found misbehaving or involved in liquor related offences after the exams would be arrested and charged and police bail will be K1, 000. “My appeal to parents and families that my decision on K1, 000 police bail still stands and I will not change that on any formal request from parents and families,” he said.

Literacy essential for inmate rehabilitation: Commander,https://www.thenational.com.pg/literacy-essential-for-inmate-rehabilitation-commander/,15/10/2025,"BUIMO Correctional Services Commander Michael Wundia has called the reintroduction and funding of literacy programmes in prisons. Wundia highlighted the critical role of literacy in the rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates. He said a lack of basic literacy among inmates was a barrier to successful rehabilitation. “One of the main challenges we face in correctional services is that many inmates do not know how to read and write,” Wundia said. “We need a literacy programme inside the camp so that those who are illiterate can learn before they return to society. There should be life after prison for them.” He acknowledged the role of the Education Department in supporting prison literacy initiatives and thanked the education department for making prisons a partner in driving literacy in the compounds. Wundia noted that a literacy programme once existed within the prison system but ceased operating 10 to 15 years ago. “We had a literacy programme in the past, but it stopped over a decade ago. “Since then, we’ve tried to implement rehabilitation programmes focused on skills and education, but we can only enroll inmates who already know how to read and write. It’s a basic requirement,” he said. He stressed the importance of preparing inmates for life after freedom and reducing reoffending by equipping them with foundational skills. “We want them to change inside before they come out. Literacy helps change mindsets. “If they learn to read and write while serving their time, they are more likely to return to society with a new perspective and avoid going back to the behaviours that brought them in,” he said. Wundia also made a plea for greater financial support from the government and stakeholders. “I’d like to ask that funding be made available to support such programmes, not only in the communities but also within correctional services. “Juveniles especially need access to these programmes so they don’t go back to the same things they came in for,” he said.",Education,Anticipation,Nill,The National

Court refuses to grant Nepo’s stay application,https://www.thenational.com.pg/court-refuses-to-grant-nepos-stay-application/,15/10/2025,"THE Supreme Court yesterday refused to grant leave on the stay application by acting Correctional Services (CS) commissioner Bernard Nepo. Justice Derek Hartshorn, who presided as a single-man bench, ruled that Nepo would not face direct prejudice if leave was not granted. Nepo filed the application for an order to stay the proceedings and orders of the National Court made on Aug 1, in the case between David Suagu and Nepo and the State, pursuant to Section 19 of the Supreme Court Act, pending determination of the appeal or until further orders. The respondents in this matter are Suagu and the State. Nepo, through his lawyer, argued that the determination of the decision of Aug 1 appealed against will settle not only the legality of the contract of employment of Suagu but for other senior management members also. He submitted that the National Court erred in both law and fact in holding that he did not have authority to terminate the Suagu, which has the effect of opening floodgates for disgruntled officers to dispute critical decision by him. He argued that this could cause instability in the service, an important government institution, and asked the court to grant leave on the stay application, pending determination of the substantive appeal. Suagu’s lawyer objected and among other grounds, argued that there was evidence that his client was left out of payroll and benefits of his position, and submitted that Suagu would suffer greater prejudice, and hardships more than Nepo, if leave was granted for a stay. Lawyer representing the State objected, and conceded that Nepo was not re-appointed so he did not have the powers to make the decision to terminate Suagu at that material time. After considering the parties’ arguments, Justice Hartshorn ruled that Suagu would suffer great prejudice for being left out of payroll and benefits of his position. “I make an order that the application for a stay filed on Aug 6 is refused,” he said.",Law,Sadness,Nill,The National

ToRot to become first native saint,https://www.thenational.com.pg/torot-to-become-first-native-saint/,14/10/2025,"AFTER 30 years, Catechist Blessed Peter ToRot has passed the final chapter of the cannonisation process and will be the first native Papua New Guinea Saint. ToRot, originally from Rakunai in East New Britain, will be recognised on Sunday at the St Peters Basilica in the Vatican City by Pope Leo. In attendance will be Archbishop of Port Moresby Sir John Cardinal Ribat, Catholic Bishops Conference General-Secretary Fr Lawrence Arockiaraj Bereina, president of the Catholic Bishops conference PNG and the Solomon Islands, and Bereina diocese Bishop Otto Separy, Catholic officials, more than 80 Catholic faithful and immediate family members. Sir Cardinal Ribat said that ToRot’s courage in defending the sanctity of marriage during the Japanese occupation of PNG, and his ultimate martyrdom by poisoning in 1945, served as a profound inspiration for all Catholics and all people of faith, not just in PNG but across the Pacific. Sir John said that the cannonisation marked a historic spiritual milestone, making him the nation’s first saint and a recognition of PNG’s Christian heritage. “Despite being a layman, he dedicated his life to the church even surrounded by danger and was a devoted husband and father. “This serves as a strong example and encouragement for Catholic families and people of faith worldwide. “This is the time when we are to pray together for this event and to be of service just as what ToRot demonstrated by his faith. “He stood firm on the Christian values of honouring one marriage partner, and that is how all should live during this time.” During the canonisation, the Pope will declare ToRot a saint in a special Mass. The ceremony will include the pope reading a formal proclamation and the relics of the new saint are then presented for adoration by the faithful. Catholic Bishops Conference General Secretary Fr Lawrence Arockiaraj said that bishops and church officials would arrive in Rome on Friday. “On Saturday at 9am, the PNG delegation will visit the tomb of Pope Francis at St Mary Major, followed by a vigil in the evening at the Daughters of our lady of the sacred heart church in Piazza Navona. “The canonisation takes place on Sunday at the St Peters Basilica where ToRot is recognised as the country’s first saint among others from around the world. “On Monday, the delegation including Bishops from the Solomon Islands have an audience with the Holy Father Pope Leo. “A thanksgiving mass follows for by then Saint ToRot, followed by dinner.”",Religion,Joy,Nill,The National

No treaty consultation: Scholar,https://www.thenational.com.pg/no-treaty-consultation-scholar/,13/10/2025,"CONSULTATION is one of the biggest things lacking in the Pukpuk Treaty signed by Papua New Guinea and the Australia in Canberra recently, says a PhD candidate from the Australian National University. Michael Kabuni, also a former political science lecturer at the University of PNG, said the Australian parliament had a joint standing committee on treaties. “What they did with this treaty before committing the Australians they held consultations with the public,” he said. “That’s documented and that’s available on the Australian government website. You can read and find out what Australians think of the treaty. You will not find that in PNG or on our websites.” “Where is the consultation?” Kabuni said PNG is more than foreign affairs, and the Office of the Prime Minister with many people outside these offices were never given the opportunity to have their say. “You can go and sign whatever agreement you want with Australia if it benefits you but if you’re committing a nation the nation should have a say,” he added. He also said the counter-argument would be that MPs went through elections and they are the mandated leaders, but during those times, there was no campaign on foreign policy, defence or international obligations. “You never gave the citizens an option to decide you are the right person to be in Parliament to deal with these issues. “You look at the leaders of both countries, one engaged with its population the other one didn’t,” Kabuni said. He added that there are views whether Australian troops on PNG soil would be subject to PNG laws and this is something that we will probably know more as the month progresses and both sides clarify provisions in the treaty. Kabuni said when the Australian government was going for elections last year, they made it clear what their position on foreign affairs was. He said their people knew exactly what they were voting for. “What their foreign affairs would be was made clear to the population. Not the specifics but they gave a general idea of what they were going to do,” he said. During a media briefing on Friday into the recently signed Pukpuk Treaty between Australia and Papua New Guinea, elevating it to an alliance, Kabuni said no PNG political party during the elections said anything about foreign affairs or military. He said Pangu Pati didn’t even have a policy document. Kabuni said when you look, Australia’s defence-related papers of which the most recent is the strategic defence review 2023, China is the reason there are security concerns. “Why would you need 10,000 additional soldiers? It’s been sold to PNG as an employment opportunity. It does not need a treaty to get that amount to serve the Australian Defence Force,” he asked. “That’s not the only way of getting jobs in Australia. “It’s not the strongest argument put forward.”",Politics,Anger,Nill,The National

We’re adapting to change,” she said. But Pakakota noted that the transition had not been easy. She said that the newsroom had to hire not only journalism graduates but also people from other professional backgrounds because there was a need for that. “We recruit people who studied law, for example, because they make good court reporters,” she said. “We just train them to write in simple English for everyone to understand.” Pakakota added that the newsroom operated under the company’s code of conduct and the Media Council’s Code of Ethics, which guided daily operations. Reflecting on her 26 years in the industry, she said that one major issue was the safety of journalists. “Reporters often face threats, dismissals, or lawsuits for their work. Sometimes they are pressured to stop critical reporting,” she said. Pakakota added thatThe Nationaltook such matters seriously. “We report threats to police and relevant authorities.

Isoaimo said the landscape of energy systems would change in 50 years and the world would not look the same. “Africa and the Pacific, including PNG, would rise as energy exporters, not of minerals but of clean power. “So how do we use our wealth beneath our soil to power a cleaner, more secure and more inclusive future above it?” Isoaimo said that the country’s oil and gas revenues should take the nation towards rural electrification, research and development, renewable infrastructure and knowledge creation. “We must also invest in science, in innovation, in Stem (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathemetics) and in our children’s future, not just in projects,” he said. “We must also confront the uncomfortable truths like: will our land still belong to our people in 50 years, will our children inherit opportunity or dependency and will they sell their birthrights out of desperation because we left them unprepared?” Isoaimo said the energy sector must become more diverse, resilient and aligned with global clean energy markets. “Natural gas would remain vital for now to stabilse the economy but the renewables will be our long-term foundation,” he said. He expressed concern that the country may not be ready in time to benefit wisely when energy becomes the new gold in the future. He said he was anxious of foreigners taking control of the country’s energy sector. “Vision of the energy sector for 2075 must be clear that every household must have access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy, powered by renewable resources of the land and the intellect of PNG,” he said.",Energy,Anticipation,Peter Isoaimo,The National
Duma blames past governments for ignoring PNG Power,https://www.thenational.com.pg/duma-blames-past-governments-for-ignoring-png-power/,10/10/2025,"STATE Enterprises Minister William Duma has blamed the failure of many past governments to help PNG Power Limited fund the upgrade of generators and transmission lines for the power supply issues faced today. Duma stated that the Government now had electricity generation as a central policy. It began with increasing funding for PNG Power to maintain and upgrade infrastructure, improving working conditions for staff and improving supply for a growing population. He said that it had not been easy. “The Government has approved a PNG Power stabilisation plan (which) includes measures to enhance revenue and prevent electricity theft, reduce costs as this relates to diesel fuel generators, to (have) better management and restoring and modernising infrastructure,” he said. “We have millions more people using electricity and wanting to be connected. Our Government has set a goal to achieve 70 percent electrification for our people by 2030, with universal access by 2050. “The profit margin for PNG Power before tax has improved and our chief executive officer Paul Bayly has been leading the way to maintain this strength. “But we have to be honest and up-front with our people and businesses who consume power and other stakeholders including potential investors, that we have a lot of work ahead.” He said that the challenge was that every day many parts of the country including Port Moresby faced load-shedding which was not ideal. Duma added that it was the right time to begin the transition of PNG Power Limited from being an SOE to a viable private sector commercial business.",Business,Anticipation,William Duma,The National
Australian Defence force to start recruiting PNG citizens,https://www.thenational.com.pg/australian-defence-force-to-start-recruiting-png-citizens/,10/10/2025,"Australian and Papua New Guinea soldiers will start working together on a recruitment pathway to enable Papua New Guineans to join the Australian Defence Force (ADF). “Developing a recruitment pathway from Papua New Guinea into the Australian Defence Force is a historic step – reflecting our shared history and commitment to enhance integration between our two countries,” Australia Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said in a statement yesterday. “I look forward to working with my good friend and counterpart Minister Billy Joseph, to develop a taskforce that will see this come to fruition. “Since the beginning of this process in January, we have now seen a transformation in our defence relationship through the signing of the Pukpuk Treaty, which is reflected in what we are doing in terms of recruitment, our exercises and our operations together,” Marles said. As an essential part of this, both countries will establish a bilateral Australia-PNG recruitment taskforce to oversee the development of that pathway, according to the Australian High Commission. The recruitment taskforce will be led by Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles and Defence Minister Billy Joseph and made up of officials from both countries with the first meeting to take place before the end of this year. Among its key focus points, the taskforce will establish a methodical and considered process to identify eligible Papua New Guinean citizens to join the ADF. The taskforce will also focus on providing opportunities to PNG’s youth, while maintaining the integrity of ADF recruitment standards and continuing to help support growth of the PNGDF as an independent sovereign force. Australia and PNG will work in partnership to develop a sustainable pathway for PNG citizens to enlist in the ADF.  This initiative will take time to develop and refine, however both Australia and PNG are committed to its success. This builds on the announcement that eligible permanent residents living in Australia who are also Papua New Guinea citizens can apply to join the ADF from Jan 1, next year.",Politics,Trust,Billy Joseph,The National
Wenge’s body flown to his village,https://www.thenational.com.pg/wenges-body-flown-to-his-village/,10/10/2025,"MOROBE Governor Luther Wenge’s body was handed to his family by the State in Baindoang, Ward 4 of the Nabak local level government yesterday afternoon by Deputy Prime Minister and Lae MP John Rosso. At about 10.30am, the helicopter carrier was given a ceremonial wash down at the Sir Ignatius Kilage Outdoor Stadium before it lifted off and people waved and weeped openly. It made two brief stops – at Samanzing and then Kasanombe – before arriving at Baindoang at around 11am at the temporary helipad built by the villagers. Hundreds more people waited there to receive him. They were covered in mud and ash, hands on their head, wailing, some throwing flowers on his casket as it was carried into the main arena set up by pall bearers. The mourning house set up near the tomb was decorated in Morobe provincial colours of yellow, blue and green. Students from Migere Wenge Primary School, which the late governor had founded and named after his mother, led the flag-raising ceremony to open the brief programme. Among those accompanying Rosso to handover the body was Police Minister and Bougainville MP Peter Tsiamalili Jnr, vice-minister planning and Komo-Hulia MP from Hela Daniel Tindipu, Sam Basil Jnr (vice minister mining and Bulolo MP), and Pangu Party executives. Rosso shared condolences of the Governor-General, Prime Minister and the people of PNG and Morobe with the people of Nabak and Baindoang. “It is sad that we meet under such circumstances,” Rosso said as he thanked the family for Wenge’s life. “He committed his life to the country and the people and put you all last; I see how you are and the heart is heavy, I apologise for this. “But maybe, him choosing Baindoang is his final gift to you, his people, so that the government will make a road here.” Rosso assured Baindoang that a road will be budgeted for and constructed to open up access into this remote area. He also committed to assisting Migere Wenge Primary School, while announcing Hela’s K1 million commitment to upgrading Kasanobe Primary School as a “thank you” to the late governor for his input in the formation of Hela as a separate province. “Wenge was born in the village but was educated and became a smart lawyer, smart magistrate, smart judge and a very strong governor, a national leader – he represented you well,” Rosso said. “I encourage you children of Baindoang and Nabak to follow his footsteps.” Rosso thanked his son Matthew Wenge and brother Kennedy Wenge for working with him and the provincialhaus kraicommittee and provincial administration to ensuring a smooth event, funeral and handover of the body. “Only the highest respect was accorded and I thank everyone who made it possible in your own way,” he said. “I now, on behalf of the national and provincial government, the provincial executive council of Tutumang, the provincial administration and the people of Morobe, hand over the body of the late Akisawa Luther Wenge to you. “We have come a long way and this is where it ends; I will come back sometime to visit.” The family in Baindoang receiving body thanked Rosso and the government and rest of Papua New Guinea for all their input in bringing the son of Baindoang back home.

Ex-Telikom staff demand full entitlements be paid,https://www.thenational.com.pg/ex-telikom-staff-demand-full-entitlements-be-paid/,10/10/2025,"MORE than 200 former staff members of the State-owned Telecommunications company under a retirement exercise yesterday demanded they be paid their full entitlements immediately. In a gathering outside the Telikom Rumana office yesterday, they demanded answers from the management on their retrenchment status and based on what grounds. Former senior finance staff Mary Wak, who worked for 34 years, said it was injustice in the manner they were treated and the retrenchment, according to them, was carried out under the pretext of termination. “Staff were not notified prior to their exit and were only paid their recreational and fellow leave entitlements two days after being served their letters of retirement and retrenchment. This is a call for ex-gratia entitlements against the number of years we were in service,” she said. “There was no human resource consultation and no updates and no discussions on retirement or retrenchment. “During the 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations at Rumana on Sept 12, the chief executive officer publicly declared that funding had been approved to retire for “those above 60 years (old) and those aged 55 who wished to leave” and they would consider the first 100 staff. “Yet, just eight days later, more than 120 employees and including young staff aged 25 to 60 were forcefully terminated nationwide.” Wak said this “was not retirement but a coordinated purge”. In 2019, when bemobile to Telikom PNG merger was announced, the CEO confidently assured staff and the public that no employee would lose their job and that every worker’s position, dignity and entitlement would be protected under the new Telikom Limited. In 2021, the restructure took place and every employee was refitted into new roles. Telikom chief executive officer (CEO) Amos Tepi in a media conference with Kalang FM last week, said he had “done everything possible to accommodate all personnel”. A statement that did not go down well with the staff, now forcefully retrenched and retired. “The CEO’s statements on Kalang and EMTV are a fabrication, meant to sanitise injustice and he has failed in leadership, integrity and moral responsibility,” Wak said. “What should have been a process guided by consultation and compassion was instead executed with secrecy, arrogance and contempt. “The CEO boasted that we have a legal requirement to retire staff at 55, which is fine but where are the full entitlements? “Many long-serving employees with 30, 35 even 40 years of service were handed K50,000, K12,000, K5,000 or even as low as K2,000 and these are amounts that barely cover a few months of living expenses, let alone a lifetime of service. “These token payments represent only furlough and recreation leave, not full retirement benefits. “Therefore, this is not compliance, this is exploitation disguised as policy. “Telikom Limited and the chief executive officer Amos Tepi, general manager corporate services Poyep Kilepak and chief financial officer Esperenza Mendoza must come out and explain the real intent of the exercise and how the calculations were made,” she said. She said failure to address this, the issue will be brought to Labor before considering legal action on the management.",Business,Anger,Nill,The National

Civil registry says 3.8 million citizens registered so far,https://www.thenational.com.pg/civil-registry-says-3-8-million-citizens-registered-so-far/,10/10/2025,"ABOUT 3.8 million persons have been registered under the National Identification (NID) project since its inception 10 years ago, according to PNG Civil and Identity Registry. Acting registrar-general Salome Bogosia said the registry has processed about three million records, of which 2.8 million birth certificates and 1.3 million NID cards have been issued. “There have been many issues affecting the project over the years but we are working to resolve them going forward,” she said. “We face rugged terrain, poor Infrastructure, and severe weather delaying outreach and equipment delivery. “Community misinformation and low awareness hinder participation, while staffing shortages exacerbate the strain on peak campaigns. “Offline NID processing continues dally, but backlogs persist. “We are currently pursuing better technology alternatives to address some of the system technical challenges. “We are working through digitisation, automation, and enhanced data security to address some of these issues.” She said the registry plans to recruit more staff next year to help reduce the backlog of registrations that needed to be processed and the issuance of NID cards. “Since 2018, a new human resource strategy focused on recruiting new graduates with a minimum GPA of 2.6 through a resilience volunteer programme. “We are also promoting zero tolerance on a ‘no gift policy’ to manage the perception of bribery and corruption in all client interactions. “We are now currently focused on mobilising manpower to double the workforce from 500 to 1,000 to tackle the call by the Government to register 95 per cent of the country,” she said. Bogosia said the recently enacted Civil Identity Registry Act 2024 provided basis upon which the registry currently operates, adding that it was crucial to the reforms being undertaken to improve its roles and functions. “The Act mandates registration of births, deaths, marriages, adoptions, divorces, and legitimistion, Integrating NID with biometric verification and enabling data sharing. “It also reinforces governance with biometric verification and inter-agency data sharing with the Electoral Commission and National Statistical Office,” she said.",Business,Trust,Nill,The National

Santos country chairman Leon Buskens said the kits, worth about K4.7 million, would help in their daily operations, especially to register persons living within certain project resource areas in the country for them to have better access to services. He said the presentation of the kits were based on a partnership agreement between Santos and the registry which started three years ago. “As we all know, there have been many challenges affecting the country for the last 50 years,” he said. “But here at Santos, we want to be part of the solution so we are pleased to be given this opportunity. “These kits will unlock efficiency and allow our people access to opportunities as it will give them true and legal identity. “It will also strengthen our operations so it’s a win-win for us. “PNG has oil, gas, and other resources so it is important that our people in those project areas are identified so they can have access to services.” Administrative Services Minister Richard Masere thanked Santos for its support, adding that the new kits would boost the PNG Civil and Identity Registry’s efforts to increase NID registration in the country. “These kits will allow for people who have long been excluded due to geographic and infrastructure barriers to be registered under the NID project,” he said. “For many of them, especially those in rural and remote regions, access to registration centres has been limited or non-existent. “This donation helps address those gaps and brings services directly to the people.” He said the kits were designed to be used in rural areas where much of the registration still needs to be done.",Technology,Trust,Richard Masere,The National
"Registration of all citizens essential, says Masere",https://www.thenational.com.pg/registration-of-all-citizens-essential-says-masere/,10/10/2025,"ADMINISTRATIVE Services Minister Richard Masere says the registration of all citizens under the National Identification (NID) project is essential for people to access basic services in the country. Masere said despite the negative attention drawn by the NID project over the years, its purpose remained to ensure that all citizens had access to a legal form of identity recognised by the State. He said the NID project, which ran as a standalone Government programme since 2014, was now given to the statutory body, PNG Civil and Identity Registry, to implement. The project, among its other functions, issues a card as the official document issued to Papua New Guinean citizens as proof of identity legislated by the Civil Identity Registry Act 2024. “Since its inception, the NID project was dogged by so much controversy with legacies that continue to overshadow the project, even with the new office of the PNG Civil and Identity Registry,” Masere said. “Despite early controversies with the project, its mission remains vital to providing people access to services like health and education. “The persistent challenges of underfunding, limited staffing and outdated infrastructure, have affected the implementation of the NID project over the years. “Now, the PNG Civil and Identity Registry continues to uphold its mandate: registering births, adoptions, marriages, divorces, and deaths, and issuing NID cards. “These cards, compulsory for all citizens aged 18 and above, are foundational to accessing essential services such as education, healthcare, travel, banking. employment and landowner royalties.” Masere said the NID project was an integral part of the Government’s agenda to provide legal identity for all, including using this data with other agencies to allow ease of services to the people. “In an era shaped by digital economies and data­driven governance, legal identity is more than a personal credential, he said.",Government,Trust,Richard Masere,The National

Ruru said the organisation not only looked after PLWDs but ensured that caregivers were also well taken care of. “Many a times we focus on the PLWDs and forget about their caregivers who spend most of their time looking after them,” she said. “Our programmes are not only about providing essential items such as food and clothes but we also do house maintenance, medical care help, and social inclusion. “We have projects such as building a kitchen in Bumayong to provide a clean facility for preparing food, a chicken poultry project and sewing project for PLWDs to generate income for themselves.” Ruru said they were working with the Australian Awards to send those who had completed Grade 12 for further studies. “Since we are a non-profit organisation, we do need sponsorship and donations to continue our work, but we are still doing our research and community work in finding and registering PLWDs so that they can have equal access to all services,” she said.

He said the first core principles of the treaty undermined PNG’s sovereignty and territorial boundary. “If interpreted, it means if war was not meant for us, will become our wars and Australia’s enemies will become our enemies in the event of any invasion,” Tomuriesa said. “The treaty appears to conflict with PNG’s two long-standing foreign policies of being friends to all and enemy to none and the Look North Policy.” Tomuriesa said this could undermine diplomatic flexibility and reduce opportunities for cooperation with PNG’s key economic partners He said for a developing nation with an open foreign policy, this could jeopardise foreign investments, particularly with China and Japan, which played significant roles in PNG’s economic development. “Restricting military engagements with these nations may send unintended signals and risk destabilising the very investments that sustain our country,” Tomuriesa said. Tomuriesa added that the Government should focus on securing economic treaties and communique rather than securing military treaties. He questioned whether the treaty would benefit the nation or it was just another “boomerang” treaty, which would facilitate only Australia’s security interest. Tomuriesa said one hurdle remained for the treaty and that would involve the Parliament to debate and vote when Parliament resumed on Oct 28. He urged all MPs to critically evaluate and vote for the interest of PNG to safeguard its sovereignty, national interest, and maintaining stronger ties with the country’s bilateral partners.",Politics,Fear,Douglas Tomuriesa,The National

New Porgera manager wants Enga government to protect mine’s interest,https://www.thenational.com.pg/new-porgera-manager-wants-enga-government-to-protect-mines-interest/,10/10/2025,"ENGA needs to protect the New Porgera Limited (NPL) because the provincial government holds 15 per cent equity, says NPL country manager Karo Maha. Maha was speaking on the operations of NPL, in spite of the many challenges it faced, including law and order issues, in a summit in Wabag on Oct 2 aimed at finding a way forward. Maha, in acknowledging the partnership between NPL and the provincial government, said NPL started its operations last year and did not declare any profit, but made a tax contribution of K155 million. This year, from its first half of operations, NPL paid K500 million in taxes, and declared US$230 million (about K959.8 million)  in dividends, she said, adding that five per cent of the amount went to the provincial government. But NPL could be making more money and producing more gold if it had operated from a stable and safe working environment, Maha said. She said NPL continued to face stoppages that resulted in a day’s loss of K300 million in revenue from disturbances caused by illegal miners inside the pit. “We have highlighted to the prime minister, police minister, and mining minister, for the State to intervene. The State is primarily responsible for law and order,” Maha said. “The illegal miners are of threat to our workforce and assets. “Our workers continue to be robbed and harassed inside the open pit. “They are slashed and stoned, equipment burnt when we clear the illegal miners out in the open pit. “All of these add to the mounting expenses of the company, and impact our profit.” Maha said the chief inspector of mines could close down the operations if the issue on illegal mining was not addressed by the State. She said 129,979 trespassers in the open pit had been recorded from January to last month. Maha said employees were being robbed and security personnel shot at by illegal miners. She said Porgera required sufficient security manpower. Maha said through consultations with the Government, NPL had proposed a new tax credit scheme where three to four per cent of accessible tax income be made available to law and order programmes, investing in police and Correctional Services infrastructures. She said NPL, under a temporary arrangement, is taking in a district court magistrate to hear cases. “It is not an easy fix, and it involves a lot of things, but we all need to work together with the landowners to make Porgera safe,” Maha said. “One of the things we have done in our commercial agreement, is to put up US$15 million (about K62.74 million) for Porgera landowners, on the condition that we have a safe and exclusive environment of our tenements. “In other words, no illegal miners, no trespassers.” Maha said the thing that NPL would like to see happening quickly was that through the community development agreement (CDA), to be negotiated, underlined and signed, so benefits could flow to the people on the ground. Prime Minister James Marape said the CDA would be signed off by the end of this month. NPL has approved its national content plan, Maha said. She said the content plan would cover business development and employment. Maha said the plan would be launched before the end of the year. It was made known in the summit that illegal miners were from other districts, and persons with influence sponsored the activity.",Business,Fear,James Marape,The National
Marape describes Japan as a sincere and genuine friend,https://www.thenational.com.pg/marape-describes-japan-as-a-sincere-and-genuine-friend/,10/10/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has described Japan as a “sincere and genuine” friend for its five decades of continued support to Papua New Guinea. “A friendship built through infrastructure development forged forward from the battles fields of World War Two (WW2) and a gateway into the future,” he said. Japan’s consistent help to the country, under the Official Development Assistance (Oda), exceeds 50 years, with its golden celebrations in October last year. Under the Oda, Japan has contributed immensely to PNG in terms of social, infrastructure, health, education and economic development. It has over the years pumped in more than K6 million to aid development projects under Japan International Corporation Agency (Jica). In October 2023, a new international airport near Lae was opened. It was renamed Nadzab Tomodachi International Airport. The name was proposed by Marape to honour the history between PNG and Japan. This project was part of Jica’s long-term infrastructure support. It was a loan project that supported the construction of a new passenger terminal, upgrade of new runways, construction of taxiways, and renovation of the control and fire towers. At the opening ceremony, Japanese dignitaries, including then foreign affairs minister Horii Iwao, and local leaders attended the opening. PNG shares a historical connection with Japan where in 1943, during WW2, it was the sight for fierce battles where more than 150,000 Japanese imperial Japanese soldiers lost their lives in what was known as the “place of no return” for Japanese troops in New Guinea. Imperial Japan had established bases in places such as Rabaul, Buna and Lae but in 1943, the allied forces launched an airborne operation on Nadzab, quickly capturing the airfield and turning the tide of war. The airfield became a strategic base for allied counter-attacks, known as the “Northern Australian Defence Zone Air Base (Nadzab)”. Once a place of conflict between Japan and allied forces, Nadzab now stands as a symbol of peace and friendship. The airport, named “Tomodachi”, which means “friend” in Japanese, serves as a powerful reminder of hope. Marape said: “Jica has supported airport development throughput PNG, including the Jackson International Airport in Port Moresby and Tokua Airport in East New Britain. “Strengthening airport infrastructure and improving maintenance capacity not only supports economic growth and regional development but enhances to disasters and climate change by servicing as crucial logistics hubs during emergencies. Airport infrastructure plays a strategic role in deepening bilateral trust and partnership, facilitating the entry of Japanese investors and supporting stable energy supplies to Japan. “PNG, rich in natural resources, is a crucial partner for Japan, in terms of economic security. “Imports from PNG account for about 97 per cent of Japan’s total imports from Pacific Island nations. “PNG exports liquefied natural gas, crude oil, copper, nickel, timber, marine products, palm oil and more to Japan.” Marape said PNG was expected to achieve significant growth in the near future. But challenges in economic infrastructure still existed, including airport infrastructure, and continued cooperation was essential for a sustainable development of PNG, he said. The great east Japan earthquake in 2011 was testament to PNG being a true friend, when voluntary fundraising and charity events were held across PNG. A total of K10 million (about ¥320 million), including a government contribution, was donated to Japan. Marape’s words at the beginning reflected the appreciation towards Japan’s long-standing support, even before PNG’s independence in 1975. “In this 80th year since the end of WW2, with the remains of Japanese soldiers still resting in PNG soil, we hope we carry forward what our predecessors have built and continue being a genuine friend,” Marape said.",Politics,Trust,James Marape,The National
Safe houses face severe challenges,https://www.thenational.com.pg/safe-houses-face-severe-challenges/,10/10/2025,"SAFE houses in Papua New Guinea face severe challenges which include underfunding and acute staff shortages, according to a survey. The safe house 2024 baseline report stated that a major challenge in 51 operating safe houses in 17 provinces was sustainability in terms of funding and management of the safe houses. It said in recent years, cases of gender-based violence (GBV) had increased at an alarming rate, making the cases one of the highest in the world. According to a National Statistics Office (NSO)’s demographic and health survey (2016-2018), 84 per cent of women aged 15 to 49 had experienced some form of physical and sexual violence since the age of 15. A recent family support baseline assessment conducted in nine provinces, including the main centres of Lae (Morobe), Goroka (Eastern Highlands), Mount Hagen (Western Highlands) and National Capital District (NCD), had received more than 177 service users. This had since increased to more than 200, by which a majority of them were adult and child females with a few male service users. The report said as alarming as it seemed, these statistics were but a proportion of the reality and did not encompass the other service providers also supporting GBV and family sexual violence (FSV) survivors. In PNG, the first safe house to be established is Haus Ruth, considered the oldest in the country. It first opened in 2003, and after that many other organisations and groups had opened safe houses to address the rising need in the community. It was noted that most of the safe houses and accommodation were operated and managed by either a faith based organisation (FBO), a church, a non-government organisation or were simply self-funded and self-run. That meant they were individual entities with their own policies, rules, processes, structures and operations independent from the Government and to some degree, different from each other. The report said it was crucial at this time to have government intervention for the long term functionality of safe houses. Youth, Religion and Community Development Minister Jason Peter said the NSO’s demographic and health survey  (2016-2018) wasa critical step forward in addressing the need for safe, secure and accessible shelters for those who were most vulnerable in the communities. Peter said as minister, he would ensure adequate resources were committed to conditions and setting standards for safe houses in Papua New Guinea.",Health,Sadness,Jason Peter,The National

Rosso: Let Wenge’s story inspire younger generations,https://www.thenational.com.pg/rosso-let-wenges-story-inspire-younger-generations/,10/10/2025,"LET the late Morobe Governor Luther Wenge’s story be an inspiration to the younger generations, says Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso. Rosso made this remark as he told the story of the late governor, who left his remote village of Baindoang, in the hinterlands of Morobe where there is no proper airstrip and road access. “The late governor’s parents were missionaries, and he used to follow his parents around until they resided at Hobu village, also in Nawaeb,” he said. “Despite the remoteness of his village, he searched for education, following his missionary parents to Hobu to pursue education.” Rosso told the public that through his determination, perseverance and dedication, the late Wenge became a lawyer and climbed the leader to being a magistrate and later an acting judge. The late Wenge then joined politics in 1997, where he became the governor of Morobe and represented the province for four terms. “He is a great orator, a great statesmen and a firm defender of the constitution,” Rosso said. He said that the late Wenge’s story, which led him to become a well-known person, portrayed that despite coming from remote areas, one can be successful through dedication and perseverance. “It is a lesson he had shown,” Rosso said. “All it takes is commitment, perseverance and good choice in life.” After leaving his village in search education and pursuing his dreams, the late Wenge had made a final wish on his sick bed to be laid to rest where he first walked. “We were advised by his son, Mathew Wenge, that the late governor wished to be buried at his grandmother’s village (Baindoang),” Rosso said. “That place has no road access, and it was his will for us to complete the road construction he had started to connect his people with government services. “We will make sure some of his visions become reality.”",Inspiration,Trust,"John Rosso, Luther Wenge",The National
Chief secretary wants updates from department’s policy officers,https://www.thenational.com.pg/chief-secretary-wants-updates-from-departments-policy-officers/,10/10/2025,"CHIEF secretary to Government Ivan Pomaleu has directed policy officers from the Department of Prime Minister and the National Executive Council to provide information on the progress of key sectors under policy wing one and policy wing two of the department. This comes as a result of complacency in work performance and tardy delays in providing feedback, Pomaleu said. He made these remarks during his address to the department’s policy officers in Port Moresby on Sept 29. “Let me first preface my remarks by reflecting on the last four years so that you are aware of the background that I come from,” he said. “So the last four years now, I have been quite observant of the amount of work that we are doing as a department.” Earlier this year, Prime Minister James Marape summoned various agencies, including the department, for their failure to provide timely information and progress updates for each sector. Marape had expressed his dissatisfaction with the level of support the department was delivering to his office, the Government, and its established agenda and priorities for key sectors. Pomaleu said: “It was clear to me that he was dissatisfied with the level of support that the department is providing to his office, to the government, to the agenda that is established by the Government in terms of priorities, the sectors that we should be pushing and engaged in.” Pomaleu said the system of government was such that if you did some reflection, you would find that policies were generally the same. He said the emphasis in terms of priority might differ depending on which government was in office. Pomaleu said these government intentions were significant and primarily conveyed through public announcements by the prime minister or relevant cabinet ministers. “So what we find is that a lot of what the Government intends to do in the time of office is dictated by the different public pronouncements that the prime minister and minister of state do from time to time, the different press and different parliamentary statements that come,” he said. He said Marape was disappointed to note that the department lacked agility in responding to these government expectations and provide feedback on time. Pomaleu said some pronouncements made by Marape in 2019 had yet to be acted upon, thus raising questions about the department’s role as the agency responsible for implementing the prime minister’s intentions.",Government,Anger,James Marape,The National

The property continued to incur significant monthly costs to maintain services at WNB Haus, including cleaning, security, generator refuelling and servicing, and lift maintenance. The managing agent, Realtor, was asked to issue a 14-day lockout notice. And unless the arrears are settled by Oct 6, access to WNB Haus will be locked from Oct 7. The premises are still closed. The closure was effected by firstly stopping the refuelling of the generator. The 10-floor building that holds office spaces and amenities is an investment under the WNB government for the people of WNB.

National Court judge Susan Purdon-Sully heard the application filed by Prime Minister James Marape and the State to dismiss the case filed by Sonk challenging his suspension as KPHL director by Marape. The State argued that Sonk had filed five other proceedings prior to the judicial review application before the court, seeking similar relief. It submitted that Sonk, Peterson Pipi, and Dr Bernard Yaru had all filed cases to challenge Marape’s decision. Sonk’s lawyer argued that the proceedings filed were triggered by different circumstances. He said that Yaru’s case never involved Sonk, and they never disposed any cause of action.

The court heard that when that matter came before a court for an urgent hearing of the application on Sept 12, the court was granted leave that it be withdrawn as the State was not named as a party. Sonk’s lawyer said that following this proceeding, his client was served the notice of suspension on Sept 19, hence this proceeding. He said Sonk only filed three proceedings.

Police report increase in motor accidents despite awareness,https://www.thenational.com.pg/police-report-increase-in-motor-accidents-despite-awareness/,08/10/2025,"AT least five road accidents were reported in the National Capital District over the weekend. Police say awareness raised over causes of accidents seem to have been falling on deaf ears as accidents have increased. National Capital District Metropolitan Supt Warrick Simatab in an interview before the lead-up to independence celebrations last month said the police focus of awareness was on armed hold ups and road accidents. “Drivers have to be reminded that they are not the only ones who use the road. You have other road users, passengers and people who walk along the footpaths,” he said. “Officers were tasked to take care of roundabouts and traffic lights that are closest to their police stations.” According to police reports one of the accidents that happened over the weekend occurred at Bomana before the National Centre of Excellence. The other occurred on Friday around 5am at Wild Life. Both drivers were escorted to the Boroko Traffic office to be questioned.

Council: Two thirds of alluvial gold stolen,https://www.thenational.com.pg/council-two-thirds-of-alluvial-gold-stolen/,08/10/2025,"A LACK of enforcement to protect Papua New Guinea’s alluvial mining sector has led to an increase in the amount of gold smuggled out of the country, according to the Artisanal Gold Council. So much so that upwards of two thirds of PNG’s alluvial gold is smuggled out with little to no capacity to check it, the council’s founder told the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform. The Artisanal Gold Council is an international organisation founded by Dr Kevin Telmer in 2008 to understand and improve the artisanal and small-scale gold mining sector globally, including Papua New Guinea. Telmer, who presented his findings about the country’s alluvial gold mining sector to the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform in Port Moresby last Monday, said gold smuggling was evident but enforcement to stop it was limited. “PNG’s alluvial gold sector is a perfect engine for upward mobility,” he said. “It is a natural, decentralised system that puts wealth directly into the pockets of your rural people, allowing them to educate their children, build businesses and move toward a better life. “It is a resource that is currently being stolen on a massive, industrial scale, and this theft is destroying the capacity of the sector to empower your citizens. “The data we have compiled leaves no room for doubt:  PNG’s gold sector is facing a crisis driven by sophisticated illegal actors. “Our comparison of PNG’s official exports with international import records shows the stark reality: in both 2021 and 2022, over two-thirds of PNG’s alluvial gold was smuggled out of the country.” Telmer said a lack of enforcement to curb gold smuggling not only affected people’s lives, but also undermines PNG’s standing with international organisations like the Financial Action Task Force. “Most tragically, smuggling is destroying the livelihood of tens of thousands of honest citizens. Legal and illegal gold flows cannot co-exist,” he said. “The illegal actors – who pay no export levy, no corporate tax, no income tax and ignore foreign exchange controls – have drastically lower operating costs. “This commercial advantage forces legal, law-abiding gold buyers out of business, systematically replacing them with an entirely black-market economy. “When the legal market collapses, other aspects of society break down. “The systems and laws to fix this problem are largely in place. “What is required now is political leadership and decisive enforcement.”",Business,Anger,Nill,The National

Committee chairman and Northern Governor Gary Juffa said this in a supplementary statement to clarify the estimated financial losses attributed to the illegal export of alluvial gold, as detailed in the committee’s preliminary findings released last Wednesday. “While our preliminary statement estimated the annual loss to be between K300 million and K500 million, new information from experts in the alluvial gold mining business indicates the figure is significantly higher,” he said. “According to these experts, Papua New Guinea is losing approximately K1.3 billion annually due to gold smuggling. “This revised figure is staggering and reinforces the extreme urgency of the situation. “The theft from our nation is far greater than first assessed, making the immediate implementation of our proposed three-phase action plan absolutely critical to stopping this catastrophic economic drain.” Juffa said the committee stands by all other findings and recommendations outlined in its initial statement and reiterates its call for decisive action to reclaim this vital national revenue.

Papa Max David is Brahman’s living legend,https://www.thenational.com.pg/papa-max-david-is-brahmans-living-legend/,08/10/2025,"THE Brahman community in Madang recently gathered in a celebration to mark the 93rd birthday of revered lay missionary and educator Sir Max David. The occasion brought together generations of St Michael’s High School alumni, now known as St Michael’s Secondary School, to honour the man whose decades of dedication has shaped lives and communities across PNG. Representing more than 300 former students, Jeffery Vaki, president of the Ex-Brahman Students Association, spoke during the birthday gift presentation to “Papa Max” or “Wawi”, as he is affectionately called by the community, expressing the bond that has kept the alumni connected over the past 35 to 40 years. “For me, it’s been 35 years since I last set foot back in Brahman,” he said. “Yet, here we are, still driven by the values we learnt at this school. “Brahman moulded and shaped us into strong, self-reliant individuals with a robust work ethic, spiritual fortitude, physical strength and mental intelligence.” Vaki credited the pioneering teachers, including Papa Max, John Yama, John Kari and former agriculture teacher and current head teacher John Paul Malangen, for introducing the self-help agriculture concept that instilled resilience, initiative and problem-solving skills among students. The impact of St Michael’s, Vaki noted, extends far beyond Brahman and the bordering rivers of Whege, Imbrum, Tauya and Ramu. Alumni have become leaders’ chief executives, MPs and professionals contributing both nationally and internationally. “These achievements stand as a testament to the strong foundation laid by the school’s values-based education,” Vaki said. He praised Sir Max’s over-70 years of service to Brahman. “Sir Max’s work was never about recognition or personal gain,” he said. “He was driven by compassion, faith and a deep sense of responsibility to serve others. “His legacy is not just in the buildings he constructed or the projects he initiated, but in the countless lives he touched and the community he helped flourish.” To honour this legacy, the alumni presented “Papa Max” with K10,000 towards the continuation of his philanthropic work in education and community service.",Community,Joy,Nill,The National
Ipatas wants Austalian Federal Police brought to Enga,https://www.thenational.com.pg/ipatas-wants-austalian-federal-police-brought-to-enga/,08/10/2025,"ENGA Governor Sir Peter Ipatas has raised a lack of police efficiency in enforcing the rule of law in the country, resulting in the breakdown of law and order. The governor was speaking on the topic in the provincial law and order summit held in Wabag last week to find strategies to address tribal fights and lawlessness in the province. Sir Peter said the biggest challenge the country faced was law and order, yet leaders in parliament did not seem serious about addressing it. He said in Enga, there were challenges with tribal fights which cannot be addressed in isolation but at the national level. He asked Prime Minister James Marape, who was in the province on Friday to officiate the Enga Day celebrations, that four Australian Federal Police officers be brought to Enga to boost police capacity. The request was agreed to by Marape in the presence of Police Minister Peter Tsiamalili. While on tribal fights, Sir Peter said guns used in tribal fights and the sponsors were known to communities, but they could not rely on police because they did not have trust and confidence in them. The Government must strengthen its institutions like the police, Correctional Services, PNG Defence Force and the judiciary to stabilise law and order, he said. “We cannot address law and order in a vacuum,” he said. “The courts, police, Correctional Services and other systems of government must function to contain law and order issues.” Sir Peter said he had been vocal on law and order issues in parliament for more than 10 years, but received little attention. “Community leaders and churches can work at their levels, but if the systems of government are not functioning, howfar can you go?” he said. Sir Peter said there was total disrespect by law enforcement agencies, as they were allegedly involved in gun dealings, escorting warlords with guns and cash, and even involving themselves in the illegal gold mining in Porgera. He said at this time, police had not made a single arrest involving people in tribal fights in Kompiam or Wapenamanda, and reports on deaths during tribal fighting had not ceased.",Politics,Anger,"James Marape, Peter Ipatas, Sir Peter Ipatas",The National

WNB division of education advisor Vincent Kalatia toldThe Nationalon Monday afternoon that the 27 students were allowed to sit their exams after negotiations between the director of the school and Education secretary Dr Uke Kombra. Kalatia said a letter confirmed that all the suspended students were to sit their exams yesterday. “For the exam papers that the students missed on Monday like Mathematics and Personal Development, teachers will estimate their marks to account for the missed assessments,” Kalatia said. School director Andrew Karl clarified that the 27 students were not allowed to sit their exams on Monday due to non-payment of outstanding school fees. Karl said Kimbe Grammar is a private-run school and has been in operation for 16 years. He said since the school started, most parents had not been paying full fees for their children and the outstanding fees had accumulated to more than K14 million. Karl said the outstanding fees were for students that had already left school. He said as a result of the outstanding fees, most teachers were not being paid their salaries. “It is a private school and we entirely depend on students’ fees to run its operations including the payment of teachers’ salaries. Most parents make promises to pay but they never pay up. “Your child’s education is your responsibility and therefore you must prioritise your child’s fees and other education needs,” Karl said. He said since the students had been allowed to sit their exams, their parents must pay the outstanding fees. The director had warned that a similar action might apply to the 55 Grade 12 students and appealed to parents of these students to pay up their outstanding fees before the exams next week.",Education,Disgust,Nill,The National

But first we have to look at it.” Tomuriesa was commenting on the recently signed Pukpuk Treaty between PNG and Australia aimed at strengthening defence cooperation between the two nations. “Does the treaty benefit our people? And if so, what benefits are there?  We cannot be signing a treaty. We are sovereign nation. We have to guard our interest first,” Tomuriesa said. He said treaties were good only when they benefit the nation and its people. “I say this because Parliament passed a bill regarding the American army coming into our waters and we haven’t seen much about it yet,” he added. “I don’t see PNG as a threat to any nation in the world. “One time, we signed a treaty to be friends to all and enemies to none. And so does it make us friends to one nation only and enemies to others?” Tomuriesa said Australia needed PNG people to go and work there but the doors were hard to open.

Enga signs up for Miss Bird of Paradise,https://www.thenational.com.pg/enga-signs-up-for-miss-bird-of-paradise/,07/10/2025,"IN a ground-breaking move, Enga has become the first Highlands province to sign up to join the Miss Bird of Paradise family. That marks a significant milestone in the realm of the pageantry, challenging misconceptions that pageants are solely about beauty or appearance. Enga is breaking new grounds by recognising that pageantry encompasses service, leadership, cultural pride and the empowerment of women. Miss Kurie Endopio, 23, and from Enga and Popondetta parentage, was selected as Miss Bird of Paradise Enga, for 2025 and 2026. Eight contestants vied for the Miss Enga pageantry. All were tertiary school students and were sponsored by eight different sponsors within the province. Miss Enga, Kurie Endopio, thanked the judges for choosing her to be “Miss Enga”. “Whatever role we play for the province, we must all work together to promote unity and loyalty, and maintain the good reputation Enga has,” Endopio said after her crowning. Miss Enga will become a cultural ambassador for the province, carrying its dreams, heritage, and aspirations to the national stage at the Miss Bird of Paradise national pageant in December. It is a platform for the young women of Enga to shine and represent their province on a larger scale. Miss Bird of Paradise PNG, May Torowi Hasola, said the pageantry is not just a stage of competition, but it represents voices of women and becomes a strong platform for promoting gender equity and rights. “The event not only promotes the empowerment of young women but also supports local businesses, designers, and creatives within Enga,” Hasola assured. “The province’s courageous embrace of this vision demonstrates exemplary leadership to inspire other regions in Papua New Guinea.” By taking this bold step as the pioneer Highlands province to embrace the vision of the Miss Bird of Paradise pageant, Enga is setting a precedent for other provinces to follow. The province is leading the way and sending a powerful message that pageantry can be a platform for positive change, development, and uniting communities. The maiden event in Enga has captured the essence of the province’s rich culture, stunning landscapes, and hospitality. Enga’s distinctive customs, music, and way of life have showcased the beauty and resilience of the land. The event aims to challenge stereotypes and present Enga as a province filled with beauty, strength, and potential. The pageantry committee extends their acknowledgments to all the participants for their bravery and commitment, the Enga committee for their hard work and dedication, and the Government of Enga, especially Governor Sir Peter Ipatas, for their trust and support.",Culture,Joy,"Peter Ipatas, Sir Peter Ipatas",The National

Assistant commissioner of police (ACP) for National Capital District and Central Benjamin Turi led a police unit to the camp and learned that Gulf people who lived there had left in fear after the incident. Turi confirmed the murder suspect had been arrested and was now in police custody. “The Engans do not have any right to burn the houses and set up a mourning house in a public area that other innocent Gulf people have access to,” he said. He said the funny thing they saw was that the Engans chased the Gulf people out of their houses and connected power from one of the house to their mourning house at Sabama. “This is Port Moresby city, and we do not want to see people bringing their village mentality to the city. “Burning down houses and then trying to claim the land is not right and is unlawful,” he said. “We will investigate the matter and have those who burnt down the houses arrested and charged, just like we did to the person who murdered the Engan man,” he said. He called on the Engans, who supported their tribesmen to set up the mourning house and demanded K200, 000 compensations to stop. “We have names of people who are doing that. “They will be arrested and charged soon,” Turi said. He urged owners of the houses destroyed to provide Badili police with their statements so they could fast-track the case.

Expert enjoys teaching life skills,https://www.thenational.com.pg/expert-enjoys-teaching-life-skills/,07/10/2025,"LOCAL expert Gibing Oboko loves to teach locals the basic life skills in stock feed formulation, cooking oil and soap making, as well as spices using local products. Oboko, from the Gawenglabu village of Finschhafen, Morobe, has more than 30 years’ experience as a life skills trainer. The Market for Village Farmers (MVF) project, co-financed by the Government and the International Fund for Agriculture Development, and implemented by the Fresh Produce Development Agency (FPDA), has been engaging Oboko to impart his extensive knowledge to local fresh produce farmers. Most of the training that Oboko imparted has been well received by farmers in the project-targeted provinces of Chimbu, Eastern Highlands, Western Highlands, Jiwaka and Morobe. The training encompasses food processing techniques by promoting awareness on good hygiene, imparting knowledge on nutrient content, dissemination of food preparation information, and encouraging farmers about downstream processing of local food products for commercial benefits. Oboko is passionate about changing perceptions and making people understand the concept of import replacement. The trainer has been showcasing his products in the public arena drawing crowds as in the recent Morobe Agricultural Show and Goroka Show as well as during training sessions facilitated by the project and FPDA. “I tell the participants in the life skills training to focus and absorb as much as possible because whatever they learn will greatly help them later on,” Oboko said. “The skills we impart are vital as most of the food we have are grown and used locally. “We can stop imports if local trainers are properly supported with the resources required to help local farmers to go into downstream processing. “I thank agriculture agencies like FPDA, through the MVF project, for giving us the opportunity to equip local farmers with vital skills and knowledge so that they can venture into commercial fruits, nuts and vegetable downstream processing,” Oboko added. “This will in turn create employment and promote the growth of local small-to-medium enterprises in the food industry.” Farmers were also in awe of the process involved in which Oboko used waste-likekaukaupeelings and combining them with other ingredients like cassava and coconut scraps to formulate stock feed for chicken, pigs, ducks, fish and eels. “We have everything we need to make our own stock feed or fertilisers and oils which are similar in content to the one we find in the stores,” Oboko added. “What we need are processing facilities and resources and partnership with the right government agencies and private sector to build the local industry.”",Business,Trust,Nill,The National

A two-way trip costs K500. “We are yet to get an ambulance as we have a new road connection,” he said. “But for now, we receive assistance from the Wau ambulance for emergency cases and other general health programmes.” Autia said round two of Morobe’s polio vaccination campaign would start soon, so the network issues must be resolved quickly. “We have to report daily back to our colleagues here in Lae about the polio vaccination campaign in Garaina,” he said. “But without network coverage and internet access, we cannot do so. “For the first round of the polio vaccination, we used text messages to report back to Lae and whenever the network picks up our messages get delivered, otherwise they don’t.” Autia is urging network operators and responsbile authorities to resolve the matter t as it was affecting not just health services in the outstation but other basic services too.

Led by senior agriculture specialist Allan Oliver, team leader for PACD, World Bank delegates, PACD project coordination unit in Port Moresby, and representatives from government agencies, the team visited partnerships in Buka and inspected the nearly completed 5.8km Teobhuin- Sipotavai agricultural feeder road. Later the team travelled to ENB to inspect the Vunapalading-Burit road in Gazelle, the Ivon-Kulungere Road in Sinivit and grower partnerships at Kairak. Oliver spoke to growers in each province and reminded them that the project was funded through a World Bank loan and urged communities to sustain their efforts to grow cocoa production. “The funding is a loan from the World Bank and people must continue to grow cocoa and toil the land in return. “It increases the export revenue of the country that it will go back to repay the loan,” he said. He explained that the ISM conducted twice a year, was designed to assess progress and ensure projects were delivering benefits to rural communities. “We are happy that the projects are helping you to increase revenue and income but at the same time all must look after revenue so that you build good houses, savings in the bank and increase asset base in the cocoa industry,” Oliver said. Community leaders and farmers expressed gratitude for the long-awaited infrastructure, noting that road development had not reached their areas for 40 to 50 years, and said the project would transform livelihoods. Acting district coordinator for Tinputz, Joycelyne Karevui, said the investment was a milestone for the district. “This is the first of its kind and we appreciate the Government and the World Bank for funding road infrastructure development,” she said. She added that infrastructure would improve connectivity, facilitate economic growth, enhance social services and boost trade and commerce in the region.

He emphasised that the treaty will not only strengthen defence and security collaboration but also build opportunities in areas such as clean energy, policing, education and employment for Papua New Guineans. “The treaty reflects the deep friendship and mutual trust that our two nations share,” Marape said. “It is about growing together in peace, prosperity and mutual respect as we chart the next 50 years of partnership.” While in Australia, Marape is also holding key discussions with the National Rugby League (NRL) executives and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese regarding the establishment of Papua New Guinea’s own NRL team. “These talks are focused on finalising the team’s name, structure, membership drives, and sponsorship frameworks that will underpin our country’s entry into the NRL,” Marape said. “Our aim is to ensure that PNG’s NRL team is built on a strong foundation professionally managed, commercially viable and nationally represented.” Marape said updates from these discussions will be presented to the PNG NRL Board later this week in Port Moresby, as preparations continue for the upcoming Prime Minister’s 13 match scheduled for Sunday at the Santos National Football Stadium.

Judge Ellis said there was a clear desire by the people of Enga to have a National Court judge as quickly as possible. “An indication of that came recently when I sat in Baisu to allocate a hearing date for everyone who is in prison awaiting a trial date in Wabag,” he said. “When the hearing was adjourned (due to the tribal fight in Wapenamanda) the prisoners are affected.” Judge Ellis said that the backlog of criminal cases could be dealt with by the end of October. “We have already put in place a system that anyone who is committed to trial will appear in the National Court on a following Friday, and on that occasion, we will allocate a hearing date,” he said. “The hearing dates for new criminal cases will be in November. “By then, I expect a situation where a time from a person who is committed to stand trial until a time when the trial is finalised will be one month.” Pastors from 17 churches welcomed Judge Ellis. One of them, Josephine Alo of the Four-Square Church, said Enga had many widows and orphans. The Constitution Section 37 SubSection 14 states that an accused person should have their trial started within four months, Judge Ellis said. He added that recently, he found that an accused person had been waiting seven years without a trial. “Had initial trial being committed, had he been found guilty, it is unlikely he would spend further time in prison,” he said. “In this circumstances, common sense prevails. “He was released and I had the police take him home from the court in Wabag, so he hasn’t had to return to Baisu.” Judge Ellis also said that he did not forget the people of Porgera.

He also endorsed the Porgera policy requiring all businesses operating at the mine to have addresses in Enga, but cautioned that lasting benefits required peace and order. “How can businesses take residence in Enga when we are still engaged in tribal fights?” he asked. “I appeal to our people to lay down arms, protect land and environment and allow development to take root. The Government is working to strengthen police presence and build more Correctional facilities so law and order can be maintained. We want benefits to flow back to our people, but stability is essential.” Marape commended Governor Sir Peter Ipatas for his leadership, highlighting major provincial achievements including: The Innovative University of Enga, now operational with campuses being developed; Enga Provincial Hospital, fully commissioned and set to be fully staffed next year and K8 million funding for a new large holding facility at Mukurumanda Correctional Service (prison). “Our government has not lost faith in Enga. You are our country’s biggest language group, one province with one language, and we urge you to put politics aside, unite and take ownership of peace and progress. Resources are no longer the problem – Pogera’s new agreement is the best in the country – but our people must settle down to benefit,” Marape said. He reaffirmed that Enga’s resource wealth, combined with national and provincial government commitments, places the province at the centre of Papua New Guinea’s reset agenda to drive inclusive development.",Politics,Trust,"James Marape, Peter Ipatas, Sir Peter Ipatas",The National
Sonk’s case adjourned after filing by State lawyer,https://www.thenational.com.pg/sonks-case-adjourned-after-filing-by-state-lawyer/,06/10/2025,"THE National Court on Friday granted an adjournment of the case of suspended Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (KPHL) managing director Wapu Sonk, allowing the State to file further submissions. The application was filed on Friday by lawyer representing Prime Minister James Marape, and the State, seeking time to file their submissions. Through an affidavit, the court was told that Marape’s lawyer was busy with the other court proceedings and needed time to file its respective submissions to address before the court. Sonk’s lawyer opposed and argued that it was unfair as all parties were given enough time to file their submissions and there was no excuse or reason for an adjournment. He said that this was an important case and since all parties had filed their submissions, it was only a matter for them to speak. He further argued that if the court grants the application for an adjournment then it must not entertain any application, and the matter must return for hearing only. Presiding judge Susan Purdon-Sully said the State lawyer has not had an opportunity to file the respective submissions because he has been in another court throughout the week. “He does not have sufficient time to file his submissions. He had three hours to prepare it today, and it is not sufficient,” Justice Purdon-Sully said. Justice Purdon-Sully said the court was satisfied that the lawyer for Marape and the State would not bring prejudice to the plaintiffs. Sonk has filed a judicial review to challenge the KPHL trustee’s decision in appointing the Aopi board, who have not complied with the appointment process under the Kumul Petroleum Authorisation Act 2015. He is also seeking orders declaring the decision of his suspension being unlawful, invalid and void. The matter returns on Tuesday at 1pm for hearing.",Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,The National

Opposition lays blame on incompetency for delaying election,https://www.thenational.com.pg/opposition-lays-blame-on-incompetency-for-delaying-election/,06/10/2025,"THE deferral of the local level government (LLG) polling dates has caused confusion among voters and candidates over the past three months, says Opposition Leader Douglas Tomuriesa. “The LLGs and wards play a pivotal role as the first arm of government in the rural areas. By delaying the polling dates, the Government is depriving the constitutional rights of its citizens to elect and represent their constituency,” he said in a statement on Friday. Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso last month said polling for LLG elections was deferred to Oct 25. Polling was initially scheduled to start on Sept 27. Rosso said in the deferral was necessary to allow the national examinations to proceed without interruption. However, Tomuriesa said: “To use the national examination for another deferral is just an excuse and justification that should not be tolerated at such levels. Election is a five-year event and the Government together with the Electoral Commission should have planned this to avoid such schedules in the future.” Tomuriesa said the nation was experiencing a lack of leadership and planning from the ‘incompetent and irresponsible ministers’.

Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika opened the event and underscored the judiciary’s responsibility to uphold dignity and justice for all citizens. “This is not just a legal issue, it is a moral imperative,” he said. “Our courts must be places where survivors find protection, not silence.” Australian High Commission representative, Tessa Plueckhahn commended the judiciary’s leadership and reaffirmed Australia’s support. “Australia is proud to support PNG’s judiciary in its role in upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice is delivered fairly and consistently. “Interpretation and application of the law plays a critical role in how justice is realised for survivors of gender-based violence. “This workshop reflects the strength of our enduring partnership, where legal leadership, institutional integrity, and community needs come together to promote accountability and human rights,” Plueckhahn said. By bringing together members of PNG’s senior judiciary, the workshop laid the groundwork for a more responsive and survivor-centred justice system.

Today, Australia remains our single biggest bilateral partner, and consistent with our past, we are shaping our future.” Marape stressed that the treaty is not about geopolitics but is focused on strengthening their shared region and PNG domestic security. “This treaty allows PNG’s defence capacity to be elevated by leveraging Australian defence capabilities.

The vehicles include a truck for Trans-Gogol Secondary School, a land cruiser for Bogia District Fisheries, a Toyota hilux for the governor’s office administration use and a four-door land cruiser project vehicle. “The past and previous governments have not invested in vehicles for senior officials and provincial public servants to use to serve our people,” Pariwa said. “I do not know but probably former leaders enjoyed the privileges of cuts and funding from hire cars and that is why they have turned a blind eye on getting new vehicles. “These are the first batch of vehicles; the second batch will arrive in due course as back order have been placed.” Prior to this purchase, Madang acting administrator Daniel Aloi, through the administration, bought four new Suzuki’s for its administration.

Australia is our foundational relationship country,” he said. “We are geographically close and beyond geography, our people have coexisted well before 1975 and after independence. “Today, Australia remains our single biggest bilateral partner, and consistent with our past, we are shaping our future.” The treaty outlines steps to modernise and strengthen PNG’s defence capacity across all domains: • NAVY and Maritime Security: Increased capacity to police PNG’s vast maritime borders; • AIR Wing and Air Defence: Enhanced air force capacity through new capabilities and training; • INFANTRY and Land Battalions: Strengthened land forces and the establishment of special forces arrangements; and, • RESERVE and National Guard: Development of 3,000 reservists and national volunteers, with provisions for up to 10,000 Papua New Guineans to serve with the Australian Defence Force under dual arrangements, while PNG builds its own 7,000-strong Defence Force. “This treaty is not just about maintaining barracks and boats.

Mt Hagen cops urged to uphold policing values,https://www.thenational.com.pg/mt-hagen-cops-urged-to-uphold-policing-values/,02/10/2025,"MT Hagen police on Monday observed Police Remembrance Day with the message of upholding the values of policing. Highlands eastern-end commander Clement Dalla, in his invocation, urged the officers not only to remember their fallen comrades who died while performing their duties, but also to reflect on who they are in the Papua New Guinea Royal Constabulary. Dalla said the remembrance day was a significant tradition for police. “In remembering our fallen comrades who have made the ultimate sacrifice while performing their duties, we also embrace their strength and that of their families and relatives, have gratitude for the work police officers are doing, and create unity among   officers which is a value of good policing,” Dalla said. “They stood there in times of danger and uncertainty. “Behind every death, there is a story of sacrifice. “We wish to acknowledge the families and colleagues of those who died. We stand with you in grief, and in pride of the profession we uphold, that is justice, integrity and duty.” Dalla also acknowledged those who were still serving, and thanked them for wearing the uniform with pride and honour. “Your commitment gives the freedom and security which everyone enjoys, and often people take it for granted,” he said. “We remember the fallen and allow their spirit of service to remain in us as we continue to protect the lives of our people.” Provincial commander Chief Superintendent John Sagom called out a few names of police officers who died last year in the course of their duties. Those whose names that were mentioned on behalf of the many were Senior Constable Jack Kitan (Mt Hagen police), Napoleon Wagambie (Port Moresby), Constable Keith Anthony Smith (Australia), Paul Mailelia (Solomon Islands), and Senior Sergeant Lyn Fleming (New Zealand).",Police,Sadness,Nill,The National

Marape in a press conference on Tuesday said though many might have felt that these conversations were unnecessary to PNG, being on earth exposed the country to anything. “Sitting at the table and discussing issues to find peace can be an alternative instead of using guns as a means to achieve peace. We also support Israel on stopping the conflict in Gaza if the hostages are released,” he said. “Those who hold carbon footprints must offset them by helping us in conservation of our forests and sustainable management of our ocean resources.” Marape said PNG was a unique country that had low lying coastal areas that were exposed to rising sea levels. He said the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil on Nov 10-21 would be a platform for assistance in forest conservation. “On Sept 22, I took part in the USA Pacific Business Forum where Pacific Island leaders were brought together. I did indicate to the forum that we are focused on business ourselves,” he said. “We’re not focused on aid and grants anymore, we rather deal with trade than aid and grants. “We did invite US manufacturers in fisheries, forestry and agriculture and even mineral, gas, and oil sectors to look at PNG with possibility of taking up space in our special economic zones,” he said. He said the climate change meetings focusing on forest conservation were held on Sept 23-24.

PNG could be losing K3.8 billion to gold smuggling annually,https://www.thenational.com.pg/png-could-be-losing-k3-8-billion-to-gold-smuggling-annually/,01/10/2025,"PAPUA New Guinea could be losing up to US$900 million (about K3.8 billion) worth of gold smuggled out of the country every year, according to East Sepik Governor Allan Bird. He gave his view after the Special Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Reform and Service Delivery hearing in Port Moresby on Monday which highlighted the challenges affecting the country’s alluvial gold mining industry. Bird, a committee member, said it was a shock to learn that there were many public service institutional gaps that allowed gold smuggling to rise over the years. “Up to 2020, with no mechanised alluvial mining, PNG had an annual export of 120,000 ounces of gold per year,” he said. “In 2023, our alluvial gold exports dropped to 40,000 ounces.” He said evidence from importers overseas suggested that at least 80,000 ounces were being smuggled out of the country. “This represents a loss of US$300 million (about K1.2 billion) in foreign reserves for our country every year,” he said. “My suspicion is that the loss is greater than this. It could be three times higher given the massive investment in mechanised mining in the sector. “If that is indeed the case, then PNG could be losing up to US$900 million (about K3.8 billion) every year.” Bird said that the smuggling contributed to the weakness in the Kina affecting everyone buying imported goods. “ Bank of PNG currently holds US$3.2 billion (about K13 billion) in foreign reserves. “We are losing US$300 million (about K1.2 billion) a year, that’s the equivalent of 10 per cent of our reserves. Bird said the committee would make recommendations to strengthen the country’s public service systems to stop gold smuggling as the hearings continue. “Our State agencies lack the capacity to, inspect, identify or prosecute the offenders. “We suspect that our local landowners could also be treated unfairly by some of these operators due to a lack of policing by our agencies who lack capacity. “Some of these smugglers are known to authorities but they have not been prosecuted and are operating unhindered. Committee chairman and Northern Governor Gary Juffa said it was alarming that more than two tonnes of gold were smuggled out of the country in 2021 and 2022. “Alluvial mining is a vital economic sector and a major economic activity in PNG,” he said. “The widespread presence of alluvial gold indicates the potential for the sector to develop into one of the most successful small-medium scale enterprise ventures. “We have seen that investments are increasing in this sector, yet production has been decreasing over the years. “An intervention is needed to address these serious issues concerning foreign involvement and compliance.",Business,Anger,"Allan Bird, Gary Juffa",The National
State wants Yafai to serve 42 years for crimes,https://www.thenational.com.pg/state-wants-yafai-to-serve-42-years-for-crimes/,01/10/2025,"THE State has submitted to the National Court that the former deputy Finance secretary Jacob Yafai be sentenced to 10 years on each of the four counts of misappropriation, and two years for abuse of office. State prosecutor Linda Maru told Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika who is presiding over the case in the National Court that suspending the sentence was out of the question. “It is submitted that suspension of sentence is not appropriate in this case,” she said. Yafai, from Karapia village in Yangoru-Saussia, East Sepik, was convicted on four counts each of official corruption, abuse of office, conspiracy to defraud and misappropriation of four cheques totalling K41.8 million paid to Paul Paraka Lawyers in 2012-2013. His lawyer Edward Sasingian from Sasingian Lawyers submitted that the sentences for the four counts of misappropriation and one count of abuse of office should be served concurrently. “It is our submission that the head sentence is appropriately 10 years as the starting point for the charge of misappropriation and a head sentence of two years is appropriate for the charge of abuse of office,” he said. Sasingian said the next thing for the court to do was to decide whether the sentence should be cumulative or concurrent because of the multiple convictions. “The reason being that Yafai did not benefit from this offence. He has been convicted which is already a punishment in itself, and the conviction he will carry for his lifetime even though it was never his idea to commit this offence in the very first place,” he said.

But at the last minute, God sent us a sponsor, and we were able to come to Port Moresby,” he said. “We prepared the orchestra in four days of intense rehearsals each lasting three to five hours. “When we left, we had only planned for the stadium concert on Sept 16. But the orchestra ended up playing six concerts in just five days. “We look forward to the future, hoping to soon be able to undertake our first international tour.” Fr Miguel said the people were surprised as was evident in the applause that the children received after each piece. There were invitations to play in other parts of PNG which they are looking forward to. “Our next project is to find donors to transform the string orchestra into a symphonic orchestra, that is, to add a wind section,” Fr Miguel said. “Those instruments are much more expensive and we need help from institutions, businesses, or the PNG government.”",Culture,Joy,Nill,The National

This was the first time they travelled locally. Past tours had been to other countries, especially Australia. The group flew in to Kokopo two weeks ago and spent independence anniversary in the province, residing at the Kenabot United Church. Pastor and congregation Minister Rev.

Apart from sight-seeing, the educational tour was aimed at socialising and educating the group about the Methodist background, which contrasts with what they grew up knowing; the London Missionary Society (LMS) teachings. “The Methodist and LMS came together and formed the United Church. That’s the reason we came here, so that we can learn from each other,” he explained. He also noted another reason for coming to ENB was to celebrate the 50 independence anniversary away from home. “We are so glad that the organising committee here inserted us to be part of the celebration which we celebrated at Kokopo’s Malapau Beach Resort and then on Sept 16, we all went down to Kalabond,” Vai said. Some of the activities that were carried out during their stay included, exchanging of baskets or gifts with women from the Kenabot United Church congregation, Bible studies, devotions, learning how to cook local dishes, and sightseeing.

MAF, in a press release yesterday, announced this achievement for both Tua and MAF, taking a step forward after winding down at the country’s 50 years’ independence anniversary. MAF said Tua, who is from Southern Highlands’ Pangia, is on track to become MAF’s first national floatplane pilot, bringing vital help, hope and healing to isolated communities across Western. “It’s an honour and privilege to upskill, fly the floatplane, and serve Western’s water communities and PNG broadly…I believe it’s timely. God Himself ordained this. In my human capacity, I couldn’t have planned it,” Tua reflected. His path to this achievement began seven years ago when he joined MAF as a pilot, never imagining he would pioneer this role. Early this year, Tua embarked on an intensive two-and-a-half-week floatplane training course in Western under the guidance of experienced pilot Chad Tilley. Transitioning from mountain landings to navigating the unpredictable waters of Lake Murray, Tua’s training represents a significant step forward for MAF’s mission in PNG. Western’s villages, nestled among Lake Murray’s lagoons and rivers, are among the most isolated in PNG, accessible only by riverboat or floatplane. “A journey that takes one–five days by boat is reduced to just 10-30 minutes by MAF’s floatplane, P2-WET, delivering critical medical supplies, community development resources, and transportation. “These extremely isolated communities rely on the floatplane for community development, medical assistance, and transporting people,” said Tilley, Tua’s trainer.",Humanitarian,Joy,Nill,The National

Health Department says polio risk still high,https://www.thenational.com.pg/health-department-says-polio-risk-still-high/,01/10/2025,"HEALTH Department acting secretary Ken Wai says the risk of polio spreading further remains high in the country. He said this was due to the low rate of immunisation being conducted on children between the ages of one to 10 years. “Polio was actually eliminated in the year 2000,” Wai said. “But there was an outbreak in 2018. “That is why the department brought back the immunisation programme. “It is important that we protect everyone by way of vaccination. “We have a target to immunise 95 per cent of all the children. “So far, we have only covered up to 85 per cent, and that is not good.” An outbreak was declared in May after detecting the poliovirus type two, taken from samples in Port Moresby and from two children in Lae. The first case was confirmed in August in a four-year-old child in Lae. It was from this that the department launched a nationwide supplementary immunisation activity in August and is in progress with the second round of vaccination from last month to Oct 17. In a situation report, over 80 per cent of tests were conducted around the country, but the department has yet to confirm if there are more than one positive polio cases. “This immunization will be the second round in October, so that’s going to be open to children aged one to 10 years old,” Wai said. “There have been many cases before where a polio patient suffers from legs becoming weak and hands becoming small and paralysed. “Vaccination has actually eliminated some diseases like measles and whooping cough, so it is important that parents take their children for immunisation as this is the most effective way of preventing childhood diseases. “We have a responsibility to protect both the population, most importantly the children, because they will be adults and the future leaders of Papua New Guinea,” Wai added.

Interpreters get certification,https://www.thenational.com.pg/interpreters-get-certification/,01/10/2025,"TWO Papua New Guinean sign language interpreters earned their certification following the World Association of Sign Language Interpreters Oceania Conference held in Fiji last month. With the support of the Australia-PNG Law and Justice Partnership, Anna Thomas and Francisca Sam, from the Community Development and Religion Department, received their certification following the first graduation of regional sign language trainees. The certification marks significant milestone in disability inclusion as it formally recognises the role of sign language, now recognised as PNG’s fourth official language. It also expands access to legal and essential public services for deaf communities across the country, allowing the skilled interpreters who can help deaf individuals access government and justice services. Thomas, a sign language coordinator at the department, emphasised the significance of the certification. “This graduation is about recognition, empowerment and progress,” she said. “We’re building a future where deaf Papua New Guineans can access information, education, and public services in their own language.” The department will now lead efforts to develop a National Sign Language Implementation Plan (2025–2030), establish a registry of certified interpreters, and integrate sign language training into mainstream services, including justice sector institutions. Meanwhile, the conference brought together deaf leaders, interpreters, and disability advocates from across the Pacific, including representatives from PNG, Tonga, Samoa, Australia, New Zealand and the Solomon Islands. The Australia–PNG Law and Justice Partnership recognises that inclusive justice systems require effective communication and the interpreter certification would provide the foundation toward ensuring deaf citizens can engage with legal institutions – from reporting crimes to participating in trials – with dignity, autonomy, and equal protection under the law.

ToRot’s canonisation as Papua New Guinea’s first saint will take place on Oct 19, in Rome, Italy. The decree for his canonisation was signed by Pope Francis in March, following a request from the Catholic Bishops of PNG and the Solomon Islands to exempt the process from further miracle proofs due to their recognised sanctity and evidence of grace. ToRot was a Catholic layman, catechist, husband and father who was martyred in 1945 for his defence of Christian marriage against Japanese occupation policies. Ribat said there was no proper schedule out on his canonisation programme but after returning from Rome, a celebration of his sainthood will be held in his home province of East New Britain. “This is the time when we are to pray together for this event and to be of service just as what ToRot demonstrated by his faith. “He stood firm despite many challenges and temptations faced and that is how we should live during these times,” he said.",Religion,Trust,Nill,The National

During his recent visit to his electorate, Sungi said roads enabled people to benefit from their economic activities. “All the roads will be gravelled before mid-2026,” Sungi said. “All the 82 villages/wards   will be connected. All schools and aid posts should be linked by roads,” he said. “Teachers and nurses must not walk to schools and aid posts. “Vehicles should bring them and their cargo to their destinations. Also, villagers can transport their cocoa and vanilla to sell them at markets.” “Maprik and Wewak to get money. “Store owners can also go to Wewak or Maprik to buy store goods,” he said. Sungi said bridges would be built over fast-flowing rivers. “Four weeks ago I brought two civil engineers and they had a look at the washed bridge at Waramun River. “Now they are building steel decks in China and will ship them to Port Moresby. “By next month, they will ship the materials to the Waramun site, and will begin to punch the piers into the river bed to build the bridge’s foundation. “I thank Nuku district administrator Paul Nengai and district treasurer Steven Auwau who worked with the Treasury Department to secure funds to build those bridges,” he said. Sungi said the washed-out bridge was 49-metres long. “Now the new bridge will be 65 metres long. “It will be high so when the river floods, the bridge won’t be washed away. “But the washed-out bridge will be dismantled and taken to be installed over Yiriwate River. “With the construction of these two bridges, the Central Nuku LLG will be connected to the Sepik Plains. “Another road will also be upgraded to go down from Nuku district to Aitape town. “This new Nuku-Aitape road link will alleviate the risks of travelling to and from Maprik and Wewak towns. “You can conveniently access government services and banking services, and sell your cocoa and vanilla in Aitape,” he said. Meanwhile, a gravel deposit land owner, William Singama, from Nukuaglo Hamlet of Seim village, has offered the gravel from his gravel deposit free of charge for the road construction contractor to extract and maintain the roads in the district.

Wouwou said that four other leaders were in agreement with him on this which included Telefomin MP Solan Mirisim, who made the proposal to Prime Minister James Marape while launching the road and town plan in Telefomin, Nuku MP Joe Sungi, Aitape Lumi MP Anderson Mise and Ambunti/ Dreikikier MP Johnson Wapunai.

"Over K830 million in Government funds for provinces unaudited, says PM",https://www.thenational.com.pg/over-k830-million-in-government-funds-for-provinces-unaudited-says-pm/,30/09/2025,"MORE than K830 million in Government funds allocated to provinces and districts remain unaudited, according to the department of Implementation and Rural Development monthly report. It blames this on the lack of proper oversight and accountability on the Provincial Service Improvement Programme (PSIP) and the District Service Improvement Programme (DSIP) funding. Since 2018, 163 reports are yet to be provided for assessment. They include 74 DSIP and 19 PSIP reports yet to be submitted. They include Government grants for projects, provincial and district MPs’ discretionary funds of K5 million and K10 million under the SIP allocations. Prime Minister James Marape said that as far as the PSIP and DSIP were concerned, the Government had honored its part by allocating funding to the provinces and districts. It is up to the MPs to ensure that the services reach the people. The mandated closing date was March 31. The enforcement of that deadline is for the Ombudsman Commission (OC) to exercise. It should work with the department on compliance. The OC’s concern raised on its website and in public media announcements says that without acquittals, it is difficult to determine the manner in which the projects have been procured and whether they are public in nature with maximum public benefit. However, to date no action or penalties have been imposed on provinces and districts which have not complied with the OC’s demand for timely reports. Deputy Secretary Programme and Implementation Gordon Wafimbi, said the department urged districts and provinces to submit acquittals as and when they could, even if they had missed the deadline. “Some districts whose members have died will have challenges to access funds, administration or high turnover for district administrators so they are not able to coordinate the reporting aspects. There are a host of reasons,” he said.",Politics,Disgust,James Marape,The National

NGCB chief executive Agon committed to trial for abuse of office,https://www.thenational.com.pg/ngcb-chief-executive-agon-committed-to-trial-for-abuse-of-office/,30/09/2025,"A COURT has found enough evidence to commit the chief executive officer of the National Gaming Control Board Imelda Agon to trial for attempting to pervert the course of justice and abuse of office. Committal Court Magistrate Paul Puri Nii, in Waigani, committed Agon, 53, of Putsipai village in Kavieng, New Ireland, to stand trial in the National Court. “Evidence is sufficient to commit the defendant for the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice under section 136, and for the offence of abuse of office under section 92(1) of the Criminal Code Act.” Police alleged that on Feb 12, Agon abused her office by attempting to pervert the course of justice when she had issued instruction on a NGCB letterhead to the No 1 Lotto company to cease operation. At that time, there was a case pending before the committal court concerning an employee of NGCB who was charged with wilfully damaging the company operation. Agon through her lawyer argued that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a trial. Agon said that committal hearing required proper and reasonable assessment of evidence and evidence must meet the elements of the offences. Police claimed that she abused her authority by falsely releasing a public notice which frightened state witnesses from giving evidences in the case. The court found in the police evidence that Agon had abused the authority of her office by releasing the notice which was prejudicial to the rights of police informants where they could not progress the case. “In summary, I rule in favour of the police evidence, hence, the defendant has a case to answer in the National Court.” Magistrate Nii said. Agon will return to court on Oct 13 for a Section 96 (declaration) statement.",Politics,Anger,Nill,The National
Waste of government funds. Public dissatisfied over NID process: Survey,https://www.thenational.com.pg/waste-of-government-funds-public-dissatisfied-over-nid-process-survey/,30/09/2025,"SOME people are dissatisfied with the registration process of the National Identification project, calling it a waste of government funds. This is according to a survey conducted byThe Nationalon the NID card registration in Morobe, Port Moresby and the Highlands region. For Morobe, the NID and Civil Registry office was established in Lae in 2016, to allow for civil registration papers to be processed locally – a fully integrated system to process birth, death, marriage and divorce documents, as well as amendments to civil records and the population information system. Joshua Kepas from Morobe was 20 when he registered. “I am now 28 with two children and still waiting for my NID card,” he said. “Maybe there’s a need for better coordination to improve this service. But in my opinion, this is a failed project – too many processes, even staff asking for extra fees. It is a waste of people’s money.” Misang Iwong said he paid a K40 “urgent fee”. “It’s been over a year since I lodged mine. Why is it called urgent fee yet years of waiting?” Karlym Kerari, who applied in 2017 in Port Moresby, said that without an NID, getting her passport renewed would be a problem. Nurse Ani Kusak-Muriken has been waiting for two years in Lae for her son’s birth certificate. “I lodged the application when he was a week old,” she said. “Right now, I cannot apply for leave. I have to find lawyers or Commissioner for Oaths to sign state declaration form. There’s also delays with passports. “It’s just unreliable.” Former Lae MP Bart Philemon said he was not surprised to read the front page ofThe Nationalon Sept 24 about the Government failing to deliver two promises by Sept 16 – the result of last year’s census and the NID registration. “Statistical facts are vital for the government administration, providing facts needed for informed decision-making, evaluation and fostering transparency and accountability in governance,” he said. “Development plans must be based on current statistical facts.”",Government,Anger,Nill,The National

He said that Indonesia’s service passport was the equivalent of PNG’s official passport, although the service passport could be referred to as an official passport.

University of Papua New Guinea students against Frieda project,https://www.thenational.com.pg/university-of-papua-new-guinea-students-against-frieda-project/,30/09/2025,"EAST Sepik students at the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) are against the opening of the Frieda project in West Sepik. Vice-president of the East Sepik students Francy Mandau said the reason for their rejection is that the livelihood of 80 per cent of the people depends entirely on the Sepik River and if the Frieda project came into operation, it will have a drastic effect on the people’s source of food and water. “Whether the Frieda project commences operations, the waste from the project will greatly affect the greater Sepik because the majority of the population live along the river. “The people eat, collect food, drink and live along this river,” she said. She said it was important to address this issue now as it will have an adverse effect on the future generations should the government consider taking on this project. A group of students gathered at the Forum Square to explain the effects of the project and to make a call to all Sepiks in the city to prepare for a meeting this weekend. The time and venue will be announced at the end of the week. This students’ call is in regard to a call made by an MP for the Government to consider opening the Frieda Copper and Gold project for exploration and mining prospects along West Sepik. Prime Minister James Marape in his response said the Government would only consider that proposal if all leaders from along the West and East Sepik were in agreement. Vanimo Green MP and Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Belden Namah pledged his support for the greater Sepik, opposing further operations of the Frieda project. He was speaking at the Crocodile Festival in Ambunti. “I don’t want the copper project to be opened. I want to protect the lives of my people along the Sepik River,” he said. He said he will not allow the Frieda copper gold project to operate as a mine. UPNG academic Dr Andrew Moutu said: “Frieda River project is said to come in as soon and it’s worth an ecological disaster but praised in the name of profit. “Loss is our business because we constantly forge contracts with nonsense and therefore PNG is on its way down the great dissension,” he said. East Sepik Governor Allan Bird said all Sepik’s should remain calm on the Frieda prospect given the response from Marape last week. “The Frieda project is a technically and financially challenging project and of high risk and this is why it has not been developed to date,” he said. He said even if the Government gives the go ahead for the project to proceed to the next stage, it would be difficult to get the project off the ground given the issues of remoteness, potential environment disaster, having low grade deposits and lack of infrastructure.",Environment,Fear,"Allan Bird, Belden Namah, James Marape",The National

Bougainville struggling to generate internal revenue: Survey,https://www.thenational.com.pg/bougainville-struggling-to-generate-internal-revenue-survey/,30/09/2025,"THE Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) has struggled to generate revenue to achieve fiscal self-reliance, according to a report. The Bougainville Socio-Economic Baseline Survey Report 2021 states that the budget for 2024 was estimated to be K761.2 million, with only K50.7 million (6.6 per cent of the total) expected to be generated as internal revenue, and 93.4 per cent injected by the Government in Port Moresby. It states that to fund its development plan, the Bougainville government introduced the sectoral development budget under the Bougainville integrated strategic development plan. But given the island’s lack of internal revenue, the approach since then has been to make the budget dependent on funding from Waigani and from donor partners. Lowly Institute senior researcher Oliver Nobetau said Bougainville could expand its revenue base by taxing resources such as cocoa, fishing, and tourism. Cocoa and fishing alone are expected to generate K162 million annually. “Due to a global cocoa supply shortfall, receipts of cocoa exports from Bougainville reached more than K310 million (US$73 million) in the first half of 2025. “However, revenue generation for these sectors remain theoretical without a tax administration capable of capturing it,” he said. He said despite reform announcements for the Bougainville Tax Office 2024, it lacked the institutional capacity, enforcement mechanisms and administrative reach to implement and collect taxes effectively. The report states that the ABG believes that the reopening the Panguna mine can have a major impact on the economy and its budget, but is conscious of the sensitivities that must be navigated. However, the Bougainville Copper Limited, has projected that the mine could generate K120 billion over a 20-year period, with K40 billion in direct benefit to Bougainville. “Efforts to reopen the mine have been stalled by a load of issues, including a recent class action suit over environmental damage. The decision to reopen must consider environmental risks, as well as a new regulatory regime that ensures equitable distribution of wealth,” he said.",Business,Disgust,Nill,The National

Judge summons Enga leaders to answer for fights,https://www.thenational.com.pg/judge-summons-enga-leaders-to-answer-for-fights/,29/09/2025,"THE National Court has summoned Transport Minister Miki Kaeok among other leaders of Enga’s Wapenamanda district to answer for the continuous tribal fighting in the district. Enga resident Judge Graham Ellis last Thursday summoned Kaeok, provincial administrator Sandis Tasaka, acting provincial police commander, Kelly Sombe, Major Kents, commander of defence force contingent in Enga and a Danny Katie to enforceguaranteed rights and freedoms under Section 57 (1) of the Constitution. Ellis said the court was compelled under Section 57 (1) of the Constitution to act after receiving reports that ongoing ethnic clashes had disrupted schools, delayed court hearings and left detainees stranded in the Baisu Correctional Facility in Western Highlands. Ellis said the affected persons’ rights to freedom (sect 32), to freedom of assembly and association (sect 47) and to freedom of movement (sect 52) were affected by the ongoing violence. Section 57 of the Constitution of Papua New Guinea (PNG) provides for the enforcement of guaranteed rights and freedoms and grants the National Court the power and duty to inquire into, protect, and enforce these rights and freedoms when they are perceived to have been infringed. The matter is the enforcement of basic rights under the constitution (Sect 57) and relates to tribal fighting in Wapenamanda and its impact on the work of the national court and the education of children and the continued detention or remand and imprisonment of detainees, remandees and prisoners from Enga in Baisu prison. Papua New Guinea Law Society President Hubert Namani congratuled Judge Ellis’ initiative to summon the leaders of the province as “the best way to use judicial powers to protect rights and uphold the rule of law”. “The recent decision of the National Court in Wabag, to take the initiative under Section 57(1) of the Constitution and inquire into the impact of tribal fighting in Wapenamanda, is a welcome and timely intervention,” he said. “By stepping in on its own motion, the Court has demonstrated the breadth of its jurisdiction and the depth of its responsibility to protect fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under our Constitution.” Namani said this proactive stance was not only commendable but necessary in a time when violence, instability, and impunity continue to undermine the lives of our people. “The issues raised in this case go beyond Enga,” he said. “They reflect broader challenges our nation faces: ongoing human rights abuses, the devastating impact of tribal violence, the denial of education to our children, the obstruction of justice, and the erosion of community safety.”",Politics,Anger,Nill,The National

In a statement, secretary Wohengu explained: “Operational integration is provided for, so defence personnel of both countries can be trained on similar platforms and assets essential for interoperability.” “Recruitment must not be confused with integration. Recruitment as an employment pathway is pursued in this Treaty and not enlisted uniform personnel integration. “ He said PNG school leavers can now apply to join the Australian Defence Force and vice-versa.

PNG has defence cooperation programmes with Australia, France, United States, Indonesia, New Zealand, Japan and also with China. This Treaty is never done to the exclusion of any country or third party commercial presence.

He added that PPL is yet to determine the total cost of damage at the Konedobu substation following a fire on Sept 19. He said it resulted in several feeder lines being put out of action. “Restoring power following fire damage is a complicated process with the safety of the public and workers of the utmost importance and ongoing testing is underway,” he said. “We are starting to test in each place as we go in the sub-station and we are hoping to have half of the control panels back up in operation probably in the next couple of weeks, so we do not know how badly the damages are until we’ve tested everything as we go, so it is still early to say how much will be the total cost of the damages,” Bayly said. He stated that the Kone sub-station is currently in a horrible condition and they put fans in there to allow the team to work day and night to try to clean it up. “We will have to wait for a while because all the equipment in there needs to be washed with a special solvent due to the fire damage. We’d be in a better position to answer the question on the damage cost in the next two to three weeks. “We are looking across the country to try to find the parts to minimise the money we spend and we have found some, but we will still have to import some parts from overseas and that is where the delay will be to restore the sub-station,” he said. He added that PPL is struggling to ration power to all parts of the city that is affected due to not all Rouna Hydro-power Stations running. He said electricity load shedding in Port Moresby would continue.",Business,Anticipation,Nill,The National
Lack of stability in CEO position adding to power woes,https://www.thenational.com.pg/lack-of-stability-in-ceo-position-adding-to-power-woes/,29/09/2025,"REPEATED changing of chief executive officers has contributed to the on-going power woes in the country, CEO Paul Bayly says. Bayly, who is the 14th CEO since 2012, has inherited legacy issues with no proper planning from previous successors in place to use. In a recent dialogue he said regardless of this, he is here to turn the state power provider in the right direction. “I am not worried about the history, I am worried about what we are going to do to change things and we just have to do absolutely what we can,” Bayly stated. Bayly was appointed earlier this year by the National Executive Council (NEC) and his appointment came as a relief to PPL because the power supplier had been without a permanent CEO appointment since 2023. His appointment filled a critical gap in leadership and brought much-needed stability to the SOE which has undergone a lot of turnover in its CEO position. NCD Governor Powes Parkop stated that the change in the CEO since 2012 says a lot and it comes back to Kumul Consolidated Holdings (KCH) and whoever is making the decisions. “We must stop this type of practice. How do we expect planning to take place and strategy planning to be revised and implemented when we keep changing the CEO,” Parkop said.",Business,Frustration,Powes Parkop,The National
"Power outages taking a toll on residents, says Somare-Brash",https://www.thenational.com.pg/power-outages-taking-a-toll-on-residents-says-somare-brash/,29/09/2025,"PORT Moresby residents have been copping relentless power outages for more than a week. Dulciana Somare-Brash, like many other concerned city residents, said due to constant outages, the central business district and surrounding downtown areas, she spends about K200 per fortnight to refuel two 20-litre containers of diesel for her backup generator. “We saw the PNG Power Limited (PPL) public notice circulating about the Kone sub-station damage. But that doesn’t solve the severe problems we are facing as city residents and businesses. “Costly electrical appliances are constantly being damaged due to constant power surges. Expensive perishable food items are going off/spoiling and we are unsafe at night when our gen sets break down. “Most residence do not have back up power. What about them? Importantly, I am troubled to think of the size of the fuel emissions and discharge emanating from hundreds of industrial-size generators being used 24/7 in the last week,” she said. Somare-Brash, the daughter of the late Grand Chief and the country’s first prime minister Michael Somare, power still goes off now and therefore all other basic utilities like water and sewage are affected too, as people without gen sets will not be able to power their water pumps for showers, personal hygiene, cooking and general cleaning. “Hospitals close when there is no power and disease spreads when people can’t access healthcare. “If we do not know how many people live in this city, how can we know how many kilowatts, megawatt, tera watt hours we need to efficiently support, supply and service commercial and residential needs in our city with exponential population growth and uncontrolled in-migration. “Sadly, the general health of our staff, the natural environment and our families are at risk now with billowing diesel fumes in the air every single day for (more than) one week,” she added.",Business,Anger,Michael Somare,The National
Eoe confirms deferral of elections,https://www.thenational.com.pg/eoe-confirms-deferral-of-elections/,29/09/2025,"PROVINCIAL and Local Level Government Affairs Minister Soroi Eoe says his ministry and department are the only mandated authorities to make any changes to the dates for the LLG elections. Empowered by the relevant provisions in the Constitution, including the Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Governments and the LLG Administration Act, Eoe said his department would work closely with the Electoral Commission to ensure that polling for the LLG elections starts on Oct 25. The Electoral Commission confirmed on Friday that: Eoe said that all matters concerning sub-national governments, particularly LLGs, were under his jurisdiction, however, other government departments must work in collaboration to successfully deliver the elections. “There have been many premature announcements about the elections but we will work to ensure that the process is protected,” he said. “LLGs are an important tier of government and there must be no more deferrals. “We will be working with all our stakeholders to ensure that polling is not delayed again.” He explained that it was a Government decision to have the LLG elections deferred so as to allow the grades eight, 10 and 12 national examinations to be completed. Meanwhile, Eoe refuted recent media reports of illegal wards and LLGs being created during the current election period. He called for a stop to this misinformation as it would cause confusion and anxiety. Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs secretary Philip Leo said that if any person sought to pursue the matter of illegal wards and LLGs being created, they could do so in court. Electoral Commissioner Simon Sinai said the Commission will be prepared to conduct elections once polling starts on Oct 25. Sinai said despite the deferral of the polling date to allow the grades eight, 10 and 12 national examinations to be completed, the commission was ready as its officers and election materials were already sent to the provinces. Voters in all provinces, except the National Capital District and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, are expected to go to the polls next month to elect their leaders for the 375 LLGs and 6,916 wards in the country. “It is unfortunate that the Electoral Commission, upon the advice of the Government through the Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs Minister (Soroi Eoe), has made the decision to defer the LLG elections originally scheduled for Saturday, Sept 27,” Sinai said. “This decision was made to ensure a safe and stable environment for students who will be sitting their national examinations.” Sinai added that all other stakeholders, particularly the Finance Department, ensure that timely support was provided to the commission. “Despite the significant operational and financial challenges, the Electoral Commission stands ready to conduct the LLG elections. “Our officers are working around the clock in all provinces to ensure that we are prepared for polling to start on Oct 25,” he said.",Politics,Trust,Soroi Eoe,The National

"12,000 diagnosed with cancer yearly, says doctor",https://www.thenational.com.pg/12000-diagnosed-with-cancer-yearly-says-doctor/,29/09/2025,"MORE than 12,000 women are diagnosed with either cervical, breast, ovarian or endometrial cancer every year in Papua New Guinea, says a doctor. Pacific International Hospital (PIH) chief obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Mathias Sapuri said these were the four most common types of cancer affecting women in the country, with cervical cancer being the most prevalent. “The number of cancer cases, especially the types that affect our women, are increasing in PNG every year,” he said. “The biggest challenge for women in PNG is that they do not have access or they are reluctant to go and see a health worker or a doctor to regularly do an examination to look for evidence of these cancers. “If women go regularly to see the doctor or health worker to do a clinical examination and look for any evidence of cancer every two years, then it will most likely that you will be aware of this cancer early and treat them early. “With more than 12,000 cases of cancer cases in women in the country, the message of prevention is important.” Sapuri made these remarks after the annual globe-a-thon walk held in Port Moresby yesterday. He said the walk, which was part of the worldwide movement that brings together physicians, patients, caregivers, organisations and people, had been held in the city for more than 10 years to not only raise awareness, but also show support for the increasing number of women affected by cancer in the country. “There is still more work that needs to be done,” Sapuri said. “That responsibility is on all of us to carry the message of prevention and awareness on cancer forward. “It is good to see that many children walked with us today as we need to start educating them as they are the next generation of the country. “Young women and girls must also get tested early to prevent cancer from developing into something worse as they get older. “It is always good to undergo regular checks and examinations at your nearest health facilities to make sure you are well.” Sapuri said PIH offered services to women and girls seeking help or treatment against cancer, particularly the Gardasil vaccine, which prevents cervical cancer.",Health,Sadness,Nill,The National

Speaking at the EU–Pacific Islands leaders’ meeting on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly last week, Marape confirmed PNG’s solidarity with small island states, highlighting that his country also faced similar challenges through its island provinces and communities. “I want to place my support behind the advocacy of small island states,” Marape said. “While they face unique vulnerabilities, PNG too has small island communities that qualify under this cluster. We share their concerns and challenges.” Marape commended the EU for its longstanding role in the Pacific, describing Europe as an important partner and export market. “Europe has been a constant presence in our region for hundreds of years,” Marape said. “PNG has benefited greatly from European markets, lending and grants. Our emphasis is not on aid but on fair trade,” he said. Marape underscored the Pacific’s vast scale and potential, describing the region as a “big ocean” rather than small islands. “We are big ocean states with big airspace, and in the future, it will be about who dominates these spaces – in technology, commerce and security,” he said. He invited Europe to invest in the Pacific’s resource sectors, including tuna, clean energy, agriculture, and mining, while also encouraging European businesses to relocate and establish operations in the region. “Sixty per cent of the world’s yellow fin tuna comes from the Pacific. We have palm oil, cocoa, coconut oil, coffee, gold, and copper. What we ask for is not aid and grants, but trade. “Trade fairly with us: you sell us what we don’t produce, and we sell you what we do produce.

"Peace and climate change are priorities, says Marape",https://www.thenational.com.pg/peace-and-climate-change-are-priorities-says-marape/,29/09/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape says as Papua New Guinea celebrates its 50th year of the United Nations membership, peace and climate action are priorities. Marape said this when addressing the 80th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York on Friday. “Just a few days ago, we celebrated 50 years of our independence and very soon, on the Oct 10, we will mark 50 years since we joined the United Nations,” he said. “Fifty years on, we have been proud participants in the UN family, standing firmly by the principles of the charter.” Speaking before world leaders in New York, Marape said: “I reflect on Papua New Guinea’s unique Constitution, crafted by the nation’s founding fathers and mothers, which has kept the country united across its vast diversity of over 1,000 tribes, 850 languages, and 600 islands,” he said. “Our Constitution safeguards human rights, affirms our Christian heritage, and protects freedom of religion,” he said. “Despite being a Christian country, we protect the freedom of worship of every kind. “Papua New Guinea has one or two lessons to teach the world: living amidst diversity, co-existing and living in unity.” Marape commended the role of churches and faith-based organisations in delivering education, health, and community services, which he said have been fundamental in keeping the nation together. “I want to recount PNG’s own experience with conflict through the 14-year Bougainville crisis which was peacefully resolved through the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement under UN oversight,” he said. He said not a bullet had been fired since the agreement was signed. “Bougainville reminds us that peace can be achieved and peace can be found at the table of dialogue,” he said. He urged warring parties across the globe, including in the Middle East, to “give peace a go,” citing recent remarks by Israel’s Prime Minister that hostages must be released to create conditions for peace. “As a friend of Israel, I want to say, come to the peace table where the world can learn from Papua New Guinea that peace, after conflict, is possible.” Marape also warned world leaders about the impacts of climate crisis, stating that the critical role of PNG’s vast forests were oceans as global assets. “Our tropical forests absorb carbon and produce oxygen. “Our reefs and waters shelter seven percent of the world’s biodiversity. “Yet our planet is boiling unless you have a second planet to run off to, we must save this one.” He urged major industrial nations to cut emissions, reform global financial systems and assist forest and ocean nations to preserve biodiversity. “Papua New Guinea produces only 10 million metric tonnes of carbon a year, yet we absorb more than 100 million tonnes,” he said.",Politics,Trust,James Marape,The National
Man retrieves papers and gains a ‘son’,https://www.thenational.com.pg/man-retrieves-papers-and-gains-a-son/,29/09/2025,"A TWIST of fate brought three persons together on Tuesday – a newspaper reseller, a taxi driver and a government officer with the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC). Heming Aru is an evangelist and a reseller ofThe Nationalnewspaper. He started his business in Bulolo, Morobe, in 2015 when he saw the demand for old newspaper. Aru formally registered his business – Waria Victory Trading in 2022, being one of the pioneer businesses under the Small Business Tax Regime. IRC states that the average small business tax rate is K250 per year and is based on cash sales from grassroots and micro businesses operating in the semi-informal sector of the economy. Aru said this newspaper business was part of a bigger plan to tap into the alluvial mining sector, create employment and pay taxes. “I believe we each have a responsibility to help our government and currently mine is to make sure my taxes are paid so government can use to further develop the country,” he said. These plans were threatened on Monday when his carry-bag with all his company documents were stolen in Lae toptown. “I travel to Lae at least three times a week to buy newspaper returns (old) and bring to Bulolo where I resell to women vendors there,” he said. “Monday, while I was in town, I left my bag with the newspaper agent and ran some errands. “I returned to find that my bag had been stolen. For a business owner, these documents are gold. “I don’t trust leaving my documents behind in Bulolo, so I carry them everywhere. So when that happened, I was worried, but I prayed with faith that I will get my documents the next day.” On that day, Kelly Nathan, bored at home, had decided to do a taxi run for his elder brother. “I stopped at toptown and was waiting for customers when a man walked up, opened the cab door, dropped a package on the backseat, and left,” he said. “I thought he would come back with more cargo, but he never returned, so I went about my day. “When I returned home, I opened the bag and saw the documents and instantly had the feeling to return them. I rummaged through the papers, saw a mobile number and established contact.” It was past 10pm on Monday when IRC Lae’s pay officer Ruth James received a message from an unknown number. She said the content — image of a document — was familiar because Aru has been very compliant with paying his tax since registering and was known by the IRC team there. James connected the two men to meet at the IRC office on Tuesday. While exchanging documents, Aru learnt of Nathan’s plight. Nathan, from Wabag’s Ebri village, had migrated to Lae last year after dropping out of Grade 10, he was also fleeing continuous violence in the area, which had drawn in many young man his age. “I have been living with my elder brother and helping him as a handyman while I look for ways to further my education next year,” he said. Aru opened his home to Nathan. “You are now my son – my home in Bulolo is yours. You will work with me and get the education you want,” he said.

Namah in officiating the ceremony on Sept 19, said that it was a unique festival. “It has its own story. It has its own customs,” he said. “You can’t produce yam for nothing. You must observe customs and traditions. “So, these culture and tradition we must preserve. “To build the pyramid of yams, you must follow cultural protocols. “Women or visitors won’t see it. Man built it at night and in the morning, women and children will be surprised to see it. “So, it is a big custom. “You must keep our customs and village tradition in yam production.” Namah said that this festival symbolised economic independence. “We got political independence on Sept 16, 1975, but not economic independence,” he said. “However, now we are looking at economic independence, and you are already doing that. “You plant yam yourself, store some for-household consumption, share some with neighbours, and sell the rest at the local market. “It is a commodity and it promotes food security.”",Culture,Joy,Nill,The National

The National Museum and Art Gallery (NMAG) is hostingPiksa Bilong Taim Bipo: PNG’s Recent Past through Photography. This exhibition is co-sponsored by the NMAG and the National Cultural Commission, both under the Ministry for Tourism, Arts, and Culture. It can be found in the NMAG Theatrette. The exhibition will be on display until the end of the year. The exhibit contains over 200 historic photographs, from 1875 until the early 1960s, although most predate 1940, after which time photography became much more widespread and available to the public. All of today’s provinces are represented. Most of the images in the exhibition have never been publicly displayed before. They show the ancestors of present-day Papua New Guineans, preparing food, feasting, dancing, fishing, sailing, hunting, fighting, etc. Many images are of activities that are very familiar, while some show things that are less commonplace today. Although many of the people photographed are anonymous, some of them are named. The exhibit asks viewers to consider whether some of them might be your own ancestors. Some photos show regional differences while others reveal great similarities between all parts of PNG – unity in diversity. The photos also show the work of early missionaries and the colonial government at work in different parts of the country. Photography was invented in France in 1826/27. Fifty years later, after numerous technical improvements, the first photos were made in PNG by members of the British Challenger Expedition, when they visited Manus in 1875, as part of an important four-year expedition that established oceanography as a scientific discipline. Norwegian researcher Jan Hasselberg has been investigating early PNG photographs for decades and has organised the NMAG exhibition. He is also the author of the bookBeautiful Tufi: Between the Past and the Future (2013), and is involvedin a photo repatriation project involving different parts of the country. The original photos inPiksa Bilong Taim Bipohave been supplied from 29 archives and libraries in Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Papua New Guinea, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States of America. These photos serve as an essential part of the cultural heritage of Papua New Guinea and illustrate how important archives are to documenting this heritage. Through the efforts of libraries, archives, and their staff, we can all benefit from these documents more than a century later. This exhibit will stimulate much reflection about our nation’s past, and how these invaluable images resonate with people today.",Culture,Trust,Nill,The National

The new Pomio District Hospital will have its own water supply system. The district has engaged a local company that has done a feasibility study and was awarded the contract to build the water supply system for both the hospital and staff houses. Kapavore said he wanted to set a standard at the new Pomio District Hospital by ensuring reliable power supply and a consistent water system. He noted that the water system should be completed in two months, coinciding with the hospital’s opening. “I want to make this a model. We will connect the water through a water treatment plant and it will run 24 seven,” he said. He also stressed that the Provincial Health Authority (PHA) heads must be proactive and restructure their systems to create positions in their health facilities, noting concerns raised regarding the lack of manpower and essential services like water and electricity. “We need fully functioning hospitals with water and power supply, and there must be staff on board,” Kapavore said. The district hospital has already recruited more than 70 staff. “As I speak, all the staff are already recruited,” Kapavore said. He further announced that the Government will initiate more similar projects across the country. Kapavore urged the PHAs, as well as Members of Parliament, to work together and ensure that all hospitals in the country have consistent water supply.

Rosso said premised on the need to safeguard both the national examinations and the electoral process, it was agreed that the national exam schedule remain unchanged while the LLG elections be moved to Oct 25. The confirmed dates are: Rosso said the Electoral Commission would announce the revised dates for polling, counting, and return of writs in due course. “This decision was not made lightly,” he said. “However, it reflects on our Government’s commitment to safeguarding the education of our children while also fulfilling the important constitutional requirement of conducting LLG elections. “I acknowledge the operational challenges this presents for the Electoral Commission, given their advanced state of readiness. “The electoral commissioner (Simon Sinai) has considered citizen and government concerns, and has graciously agreed to exercise his constitutional powers to delay the commencement of polling in the interests of our future generations and to prevent disturbance of the national exams. “I commend him for this.” Rosso said the Government acknowledged the legal advice it received from the state solicitor, Department of Justice and Attorney-General. A technical team reporting directly to the chief secretary will work through the issues raised. Writs for the LLG elections were issued in May for polling to begin in July.

So it looks like a chance to earn three per cent of K200 million is open to anyone who knows about these secret deals. “In a statement last week, defending an NEC decision to transfer all government bank accounts to the newly-licensed NBC, the minister responsible stated to all our surprise that the publicly-owned NBC was being privatised with around 50 investors already pumping in K100 million in new equity,” he said. O’Neill added that the people demanded to know “what the heck is going on with the National Development Bank (NDB) and its subsidiary NBC”. “Who are the investors that have signed up? What are the terms of the capital raising? Can those responsible release the terms under which these special investors provided the K100 million – what do they get in return,” he said. “Why are the people of PNG being kept in the dark over this nationally important privatisation of a state asset? “Was there a transparent process followed to appoint the current chairman as the middleman to raise the capital or was this procurement a closed shop arrangement? “This is not how institutions owned by the public are to be governed. We demand better than this especially from people entrusted with the people’s money and assets. “NBC seems to be a new tucker shop for politicians without transparency, scrutiny and the governance needed to ensure credibility and confidence. The FATF grey listing will soon be a blacklisting.” Meanwhile, the State, through the Kumul Consolidated Holdings and NDB, has diluted its shareholding in NBC to 52 per cent, following a private placement phase. NBC chairman Darrell Seeto said that a group of PNG citizens and PNG-owned businesses had taken up a new equity of K100 million. “Phase two of the private placement is underway and by the end of next month, we expect the State’s equity in NBCL will be further diluted to about 35 per cent,” he said. “The interest shown by experienced Papua New Guinean investors in taking up new equity in NBCL has been positive and shows they have faith in the development and expansion plans of the Bank. “It has always been the stated position of the State, that it would dilute its ownership of NBCL at the earliest opportunity.”",Business,Anger,Nill,The National
Wages ‘should not’ drop below new threshold,https://www.thenational.com.pg/wages-should-not-drop-below-new-threshold/,26/09/2025,"THE national minimum wage announced recently is merely a threshold below which wages should not drop and should not be taken as one that people can depend on for long periods, the person in charge of the determination said yesterday. Minimum Wages Board chairperson, Beverley Doiwa said the minimum wage was merely a “protection wage” and should change in keeping with cost of living increases and other factors. Doiwa said she was saddened, during her nationwide tour to make this determination, when she came across instances where people had been on the minimum wage of K3.50 for 10 years ormore. “The minimum wage is really the threshold wage. We should see our people earn more than that,” she said. “We need to tell our people that they should not be on it forever.” A veteran of three similar determinations – 2000, 2014 and 2025 – Doiwa said her board had done its job, and now it was up to government and other stakeholders to do theirs. The first task is to inform the people of what the minimum wage is, she said. Then it must be followed with compliance and enforcement. In this, the compliance and enforcement system is weak and ineffective at the present time, Doiwa said. The applicable laws, the Employment Act and the Labour Act, are outdated and date from 1958 and 1982. Penalties offered under those laws are too weak and need strengthening. Currently if a labour officer finds an instance of underpayment, he would normally advice the company to correct the issue within a set period of time – and that is about all. The workers’ unions have fallen silent and need support to get back to their former vibrancy and effectiveness, Doiwa said. Further, the industrial relations and arbitration division of the Labour and Employment Department needs firing up to operate effectively and efficiently as an implementing arm of the government. Doiwa said there had been a long lull between 2014 and 2025 because there was no political support for the work of her board. She is happy and confident that the political leadership at the present time is right, with Labour and Employment Minister Kessy Sawang who personally ensured that there was K4 million available for the board to do its work and conclude the nationwide consultation. Sawang has also undertaken to review the outdated laws. Doiwa said the board had decided not to consider separate minimum wages for rural and urban areas so that people in rural settings could be attracted by a higher wage to remain there rather than migrate. She called for more regular reviews of the minimum wages in the country to make it commensurate with the consumer price index. She called for the minimum wages setting to be institutionalised in the country rather than its current ad hoc arrangement. Doiwa said a review board or commission ought to be set up to institute minimum wages fixing. The new minimum wage took effect from September 8 when it was gazetted and will be compulsory on all companies from Jan 1, 2026. The public service which operates under its own law is not covered by the minimum wage. Minimum wages were at K3.50 from 2016 to 2025. They rise now to K5 and increase incrementally to K5.25 in 2027, then K5.50 in 2028.",Business,Sadness,Kessy Sawang,The National

He was leading the presidential race yesterday with nearly 90,000 votes after a primary count, the office of the electoral commission confirmed toRadio New Zealand(RNZ Pacific). “He is well ahead in terms of the votes he has collected across all three regions on Bougainville,” the electoral commissioner Desmond Tsianai toldRNZ Pacific. “Joe Lera, a longtime Papua New Guinea MP in the national parliament, is next, trailing behind with just 17,197 votes at this point,” he said. However, Tsianai said “quality checks” would be conducted on ballot papers from the North, Central and South regions, which could take a further three days. Checks involved combing through the paperwork to identify if there were any discrepancies in the primary count. “After completing those checks, we should be able to calculate the absolute majority and then we will be able to anounce the final results,” Tsianai said. He said that there were 33 single-member constituencies, and another five were approved last year. That makes 38 single-member constituencies, plus three regional seats for women and ex-combatants and the presidential seat – for the 45 seats in the Bougainville parliament.",Politics,Anticipation,Joe Lera,The National

All south-bound traffic – travelling towards Badili – will be redirected onto the north-bound carriageway at the slip lanes adjacent to SVS 2-Mile. “The Purth Street roundabout shall remain accessible, however entry onto the Hubert Murray Highway shall be cordoned off. “The public and motorists are advised to adhere to posted road signage, drive with caution and follow the instructions of designated flagmen,”",Infrastructure,Anticipation,Nill,The National
Customs says illicit items coming from Asia,https://www.thenational.com.pg/customs-says-illicit-items-coming-from-asia/,26/09/2025,"PAPUA NEW GUINEA Customs Services (PNGCS) says illicit items are coming into the country “from mostly Asian countries.” PNG Customs Services Commissioner David Towe toldThe Nationalthat Customs had reduced import of illicit tobacco since 2020. In 2018 and 2019, it was about 40 per cent but the figure significantly dropped to six per cent in 2023, he said. “Source (importing illegal items) is mostly Asian countries, Towe said. “Australia is now 30-35 per cent and they are finding it very difficult to bring it down and it is costing the country billions of dollars in lost revenue,” Towe said. “Malaysia has accepted that 40 per cent is illicit. They fight to maintain 60 per cent legal tobacco market. Many other countries are the same. We have been an absolute success by the Grace of God,” Towe said. The PNGCS is amending and reviewing the Customs legislations and will review the penalty provisions to ensure the “highest’’ penalties are applied to any importer who is involved in illicit and illegal trade. In 2018, an independent report by Melbourne-based company FTI Consulting estimated that the presence and prevalence of illicit tobacco in PNG was 36-38 per cent in the market. The report was presented to Prime Minister James Marape by the Manufacturers Council of PNG. Towe said that with combined efforts and collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including Treasury, police and Customs were able to drive down and significantly reduce illicit tobacco to less than six per cent as reported in a follow-up report released in 2023 by the same company FTI Consulting. “This outcome goes to show that with collaboration we can achieve great results. This effort saved the Government more than K200 million in excise taxes,” he added. “While the commendations from the prime minister is highly appreciated by the staff at PNGCS, there are more work to do,” Towe said. He also revealed that investigation into the K3.5 million illicit tobacco found in July was still going on and details of the investigation would be put out once PNGCS and the police concluded their investigation and made arrests. Marape said Papua New Guinea was not a dumping ground for illicit items, illegal trade, and illegal business activities. He said the Government had a ‘zero tolerance policy’ for illegal business activities, and warned that those engaging in illicit trade would face the “strongest possible penalties.” “My Government will ensure that hefty penalty fines are imposed, and we will not hesitate to reconsider and even terminate the business licences of companies or individuals found guilty of such practices,” he said. “Treasury, Customs, and the Investment Promotion Authority (IPA) are being tasked to review our policy, regulations, and laws to strengthen deterrent measures.”",Business,Trust,James Marape,The National
PNG Power still a long way to solving ongoing power crisis: CEO,https://www.thenational.com.pg/png-power-still-a-long-way-to-solving-ongoing-power-crisis-ceo/,26/09/2025,"PNG Power is no closer to solving the ongoing power crisis in the Capital City after frustrating outages for its customers for over a week. Chief executive officer Paul Bayly indicated yesterday they were yet to find the solution so it may take a few more weeks to find and fix the problem. He said they were still working to fix the Kone substation where they believed the faults were located. Bayly said that they did not know the exact cost of the damage because they were still working to get the substation up to solve the issue. “We are currently sourcing the equipment within the country to fix the substation, but there are some other parts that we need to import and if the delivery of these parts are delayed then the issue will still continue,” he said. National Capital District Governor Powes Parkop discussed the constant outages with Bayly yesterday. He said every school, hospital, business house and home in the Capital needed power every day and recent blackouts caused a lot of issues for everyone. He said he was aware that PPL needed about K165 million to fix most of its aging and failing infrastructures and will work with State-Owned Enterprise Minister (SOE) and other stakeholders in the government to push to allocate the amount for PPL in the national budget. “From what I know, the recent power outages is due to the Kone-substation problem but this power issue has been happening before the Kone substation problem. I want PPL to come up with a strategic plan to solve these issues and not only react to work when there is a problem,” Parkop said. Other stakeholders from health, education, aviation, security and business sectors all raised similar concerns of power failure affecting their everyday activities and how costly it is to run on standby generators for more than eight hours.",Business,Anger,Powes Parkop,The National
‘Sex is not a game’: Wai says number of pregnant mothers with HIV rising,https://www.thenational.com.pg/sex-is-not-a-game-wai-says-number-of-pregnant-mothers-with-hiv-rising/,26/09/2025,"THE Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is spreading unchecked, acting Health secretary Ken Wai says. Wai is sounding the old alarm, saying “sex is not a game”, and that prevention is the only way forward as there is no cure. Alarming too is the fact that there is an increase in the number of pregnant mothers being tested positive for the HIV. Wai said: “It is important for early antenatal checkups for antiretroviral drugs to be administered to stop transmission to the baby.” Health department national statistics show in general an infection rate of 30 cases or persons in a day with seven children being born with the virus. Records show that since the first case found in 1987, the health department have diagnosed up to 100,000 persons. The annual positive rate for new cases rose from 6,500 to 11,000 cases in a year. “The prevalence rate used to be 0.9 per cent but statistics haveseen an increase of up to 1.6 percent and from this observation, much emphasis is now given to mothers when going in for antenatal clinic and this is to make sure the babies are born normal. “The government this year allocated a budget of K2.5million to buy the HIV drugs so anyone that is found to be positive can be put on antiretroviral therapy. “That is not to cure them but to reduce the viral load so that it prevents and protects them from other infections,” he said. Health Department provides services to make sure treatment is administered to prevent the parent to child transmission. Antiretroviral drugs are made available at hospitals, clinics, health centres and aid posts around the country. This follows the declaration of national HIV emergency by the PNG Government in June this year acting on a rising crisis of infection rate. “There are many drivers of the rising HIV rates and some of these are within the health system with inaccessibility to testing, treatment, cultural and social norms that cause stigma and fear. Wai said the strong message is on prevention as the only way to reduce HIV in the country. “For young people, sex is not a game and it’s not a trial and error thing,” he said. “Wait to be married and get tested before marriage and for married people the marital bed is the only bed to have sex and outside of that there is ‘no’ as at this time, it’s risky. “So part of our awareness we advise people to wear a condom for protection or just the best way is to abstain from sex with multiple partners,” he said. Wai said those who have been unfaithful or have multiple partners should go to the nearest health centre to get tested and if found positive to undergo counselling and treatment.",Health,Fear,Nill,The National
Catholic dioceses receive buses and land cruisers,https://www.thenational.com.pg/catholic-dioceses-receive-buses-and-land-cruisers/,26/09/2025,"CATHOLIC dioceses of Port Moresby and Bereina are recipients of a donation of three buses and two land cruisers. When blessing the vehicles, Archbishop of Port Moresby Cardinal Sir John Ribat said these would enhance the health workers’ ability to deliver health care to where it was much needed. “Transport and logistics are two of the biggest setbacks in delivery of health services in the country and the donation of vehicles will make easier for the health workers in the respective dioceses,” he said. Sir John said that with a declared Human Infection Virus (HIV) emergency, these would help with more awareness and outreach in National Capital District (NCD) and Central. The three buses will go to St. Paul Gerehu clinic, St Therese clinic in Hohola and a Catholic agency, Key Population Advocacy Consortium (KPAC) while the land cruisers go to the Bereina archdiocese Veifa run clinic and the Catholic Church health services headquarters in Port Moresby. The fleet of vehicles was procured and handed over by representatives from the Australian High Commission. Australian High Commission Minister Councilor Penny Morton said Australia was committed to ongoing delivery of vital health services to PNG. The Catholic Church health services has 13 facilities that are currently undergoing a sexual reproductive health integration project under a PNG Australia partnership programme. The project over the next 12 months is tied to strengthening engagement with community and key population to gain access to quality HIV and sexual health services. Health Department acting secretary Ken Wai thanked the Australian Government for its continued support to the health system in the country. “Catholic Agencies provide almost three quarters of health and education services to the country and they must be commended for their tremendous effort,” he said. “The country could not take on this provision of services on its own without the services and funding from key partners.”",Health,Trust,Nill,The National

The new Pomio District Hospital will have its own water supply system. The district has engaged a local company that has done a feasibility study and was awarded the contract to build the water supply system for both the hospital and staff houses. Kapavore said he wanted to set a standard at the new Pomio District Hospital by ensuring reliable power supply and a consistent water system. He noted that the water system should be completed in two months, coinciding with the hospital’s opening. “I want to make this a model. We will connect the water through a water treatment plant and it will run 24 seven,” he said. Kapavore also stressed that the provincial health authority (PHA) heads must be proactive and restructure their systems to create positions in their health facilities, noting concerns raised regarding the lack of manpower and essential services like water and electricity. “We need fully functioning hospitals with water and power supply, and there must be staff on board,” he said. The district hospital has already recruited more than 70 staff. “As I speak, all the staff are already recruited,” Kapavore said. He further announced that the Government will initiate more similar projects across the country. Kapavore urged the PHAs, as well as Members of Parliament, to work together and ensure that all hospitals in the country have consistent water supply.

"New York Declaration a positive step, says Marape",https://www.thenational.com.pg/new-york-declaration-a-positive-step-says-marape/,26/09/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has welcomed the adoption of the New York Declaration by the United Nations General Assembly, describing it as an important step in the global community’s response to the Israel–Palestine conflict. The declaration, endorsed earlier this month by most member states, explicitly condemned Hamas as a terrorist organisation for the first time, while reaffirming Israel’s right to exist and the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and security. Marape said Papua New Guinea supports the declaration’s message but emphasised that peace must start from within the region itself. A meeting at the “peace table” will set pace for settlement of everything else in the Israeli–Gaza conflict. “If you want peace, both sides must sit at the table together. Dialogue must come first before any solution is decided upon,” Marape said. He urged Hamas to take responsibility as the first step. “Take responsibility, apologise and release the hostages. If you claim to be the voice of the Gaza and Palestinian people, then step up for your people and for peace. The world will protect you when you show responsibility,” he said. The Prime Minister also appealed to Israel to “give peace a chance” by joining calls for a truce and urged the United Nations to lead an immediate effort to facilitate such talks. He reiterated that terrorism cannot and must not be rewarded. “You cannot compel political solutions at the backdrop of terrorism. Hamas must lay down its arms, release hostages unconditionally, and stop holding the citizens of Gaza to ransom. This will enable Israel to come to the table for peace and long-term political solution,” Marape said. While acknowledging international calls for a two-state solution, Prime Minister Marape questioned whether the proposal reflects the genuine will of both parties in conflict. “Real peace between Israel and Palestine must be authentically born from the land and people themselves — not imposed on one or another,” he said. He reaffirmed Papua New Guinea’s firm support for the preservation of the State of Israel, while also recognising the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. “When Hamas makes that step forward, then Israel must also step forward. That is how real peace will begin — at the table, not at the barrel of a gun,” he said. Marape drew on Papua New Guinea’s own experience of ending conflict through negotiation, highlighting the 2001 Bougainville Peace Agreement. “Papua New Guinea is proof that peace is possible when both sides put down arms and sit at the table. Dialogue, not violence, ended our conflict and it can end others,” he said. He further called on Israel to exercise maximum restraint to ensure innocent civilians are not caught in the crossfire, noting that civilians have too often borne the heaviest burden in conflicts worldwide. Marape said Papua New Guinea will continue to back genuine dialogue, humanitarian protection and locally-driven solutions in line with the principles outlined in the New York Declaration.",Politics,Trust,James Marape,The National

Low-risk prisoner Allan Aiso, who was assigned to clear out the strainer, said another issue was the smell from the old sewerage ponds at the entrance of MSU and the existing strainer or filter where the waste ran through. “I clear out the rubbish three times a day to avoid the waste building up,” he said. “I use a stick to clear out mostly toilet paper that clogs the pipes here.” Aiso was assigned to the plumbing section under his rehabilitation programme and this was part of his duty while serving his five-year sentence. Apart from the heavy stench, it was also noted that prisoners did not wear any protective gear, masks or gloves. He was not issued any of such equipment but he had to get the job done or it would affect most of the prisoners. The Bomana sewerage covers the CS Barracks, minimum and high risk prison, the Bomana Police Training College, Red Sea Barracks, Kerepia and CS barracks and surrounding areas. The construction of the new sewerage site was underway between the maximum prison wing and MSU and was expected to be completed early next year. Lome Paina Construction Limited managing director Jacob Walo said the existing sewerage was dead, causing the blockages.

KPHL board chairman Gerea Aopi yesterday welcomed the decision by Sonk to withdraw the cases. “The board resolution to suspend Sonk as the KPHL managing director and appoint Luke Liria as acting managing director was not malicious in intent but administrative, to ensure the integrity of process, both for KPHL in ensuring the good governance principle of transparency and accountability, and for Sonk to addresses his personal issues,” he said. He said justice must not only be done but seen to be done. “Whatever perceptions and public opinion may be, only courts of law can ascertain guilt or otherwise. Sonk is therefore innocent as far as the board is concerned.” Court documents show that Sonk is seeking a declaration that Kil has no power under the Companies Act to alter or amend the records of KPHL in the Companies Register with the Investment Promotion Authority (IPA), unless and until it is authorised to do so by the management of the company or its board secretary, and that the decisions and actions of Kil were null and void and of no effect. He requests the court to declare that Aopi, Anga, Gware and Srinivasan are not directors of KPHL and they have no power of management and control over the affairs, employees and assets of KPHL.",Business,Trust,Nill,The National
"Expect more electricity supply interruptions, says PNG Power",https://www.thenational.com.pg/expect-more-electricity-supply-interruptions-says-png-power/,25/09/2025,"PORT Moresby residents can expect more electricity supply interruptions as PNG Power Limited continues to repair the Konedobu substation which was damaged by fire last Friday. “A couple of our feeders from Waigani substation, Boroko substation, Moitaka substation, Kanudi substation and the new Kilakila substation have been offloaded and switched over to assist the Konedobu substation feeders,” PNG Power said in a statement. “All our affected Kone feeder loads are now being taken onboard by various outer substation feeders. “However, we are carrying out load-shedding due to technical limitations.” The fire at the Konedobu substation destroyed the 11 kilovolt insulators for Kone feeders. The damaged equipment requires a replacement which must be brought from overseas. The company said that a new Kilakila feeder under construction since Monday would be undergoing testing. “If successful, this feeder will be energised and can take on more connectivity, relieving the overly stressed feeders within the Port Moresby grid. “We anticipate this to end the load-shedding. Should you experience any unexpected outages, please report to our National Call Center on Toll Free 116 or Email:[email protected]?” Work to put new conductors at the Sabama Junction is almost completed, as well as the upgrade on the similar conductors along Two-Mile. “Once all these work is completed, a technical test will be carried out, before further energisation takes place. This is a critical work that will allow more connectivity and ease loadings from other feeders, assisting the affected Kone Substation Feeders,” PNG Power said.",Business,Anticipation,Nill,The National

They include the 38 single-member constituency seats, three regional women representatives, the three regional ex-combatants’ representatives for North, South and Central Bougainville, and the seat for president. Tsianai said counting started late due to logistical issues with the transportation of ballot boxes after polling ended on Sept 8. “After polling, ballot boxes were securely transported to the four counting centres, with police providing constant security,” he said. “Due to logistical issues, counting began three days later than expected on Sept 12 and continues to progress steadily.” He reaffirmed the commitment by his officers to completing the counting process transparently and as soon possible. The Bougainville Electoral Commissioner had announced that counting was to end on Oct 5, with writs to be returned the day after.

One observer wrote to the newspaper with the comments: “Huge congratulations to the entire team at Ialibu Hospital on this incredible achievement! Performing the first hysterectomy operation is a testament to the hard work, dedication, and commitment to delivering quality healthcare services. This milestone is not just a celebration of medical excellence but also a reflection of the positive impact on the community.” Prime Minister James Marape called from New York to praise the Southern Highlands Provincial Health Authority (SHPHA) as a “model of excellence” in delivering facilities such as the Ialibu District Hospital. Marape said in a statement: “For the past three years, SHPHA has delivered vital services and saved lives in some of the most remote parts of our country. This hospital stands as proof that government support, when used well, can make a real difference.” He said that K3.7 million was allocated by the Government to upgrade the facility into a fully-fledged District Hospital. Health Minister Elias Kapavore who officiated at the opening said: “I congratulate the CEO Dr Joseph Birisi, chairman Augustine Mano, and the SHPHA board and management for a job well done. “Our role as government is to make policy, but today, I am proud to see that policy become reality,” Kapavore said. Dr Birisi said that the hospital was now the model district hospital. “We will roll out the same standard to other districts while making Mendi General Hospital the main referral centre for South Highlands,” Birisi said.

He said that this was important given the economic impact the project would have in the province and the surrounding provinces supporting West Sepik. The Telefomin district and its surrounding communities are currently supported by the OK Tedi Mining Limited (OTML) tax credit scheme. This has ensured the construction of the Tabubil-Telefomin road plus the provision of health, education and banking services. “We must thank the people of Western for sharing their resources with West Sepik during this time. This district is considered a priority under the OTML tax credit schemes,” he said. “While we are working on the Frieda project, leaders must remain in their districts and work with the resources they have now and not depend entirely on OK Tedi alone.” He said that other resources such as oil palm, forestry, cocoa and marine would generate income for the province too. Marape was responding to a request by Telefomin MP Solan Mirisim last week for the Government to consider opening the Frieda project into a mining exploration given the copper and gold it contains. Mirisim said the project would drive development and progress for his district and would address Telefomin’s isolation.",Business,Anticipation,"James Marape, Solan Mirisim",The National

Australian flag lowered on Independence Day returned,https://www.thenational.com.pg/australian-flag-lowered-on-independence-day-returned/,25/09/2025,"The Australian flag lowered on Independence Day in 1975 at Ossima Primary School, West Sepik, has been returned to the Australian government – and is now on display at the National Museum and Arts Gallery (NMAG). Eighty-four-year-old retired teacher Peter Kanawi, who lowered the flag on Sept 16, 1975 has been the guardian of the historic artefact for 50 years. The existence of the flag became apparent after a social media post went viral. His family had put a call out asking for help to give it back to Australia and the Australian High Commission contacted them to retrieve it. As a token of Australia’s deep appreciation for his custodianship of this piece of history, the high commission exchanged the pre-independence Australian flag with a flag of Papua New Guinea for the school to fly in remembrance of Sept 16, 1975, and Australia and Papua New Guinea’s strong partnership. As part of the exchange on Aug 25 at Ossima Primary School, a letter from Australian High Commissioner and Special Envoy for the Pacific and Regional Affairs Ewen MacDonald, was also presented to the Kanawi family. The flag is an important reminder of a pivotal moment in Papua New Guinea’s history. It is currently on display with the Wok bung wantaim exhibition, an exhibition which features archival photographs for the National Archives of Australia’s collection. This exhibition captures the spirit of independence celebrations and the path that led to it. It is a tribute to the architects of independence and the people of Papua New Guinea. Kanawi said: “Australia has been good to us. I kept the flag to honour the relationship and the journey we’ve shared. “I believe God kept me alive to see this day… I am happy and blessed to be here, to return the flag as a sign of respect for my country, for Australia and for leaders like late the Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare who inspired me.”",History,Joy,Michael Somare,The National

Justice Allan Kingsley David, who presided as a single-man Supreme Court bench, ruled in Waigani that the trial judge had erred in fact and law to nullify Akem’s election victory because he was not directly involved in the bribery with Rainbo Paita. “The application for leave is granted to Akem,” he said.

Buimo CS commander Michael Wundia said the facility is holding 1,076 inmates – more than double its intended capacity. This has created serious challenges in accommodation, food supply, hygiene and overall inmate welfare, he said. “The need for accommodation is high, the need for food too is high, but with support from business houses, communities and our Morobe leaders, we are most of the time alright with food rations,” Wundia said. “A rural lockup in Bulolo would be a relief for us here at Buimo.” Wundia highlighted that the late Bulolo MP and deputy prime minister Sam Basil had planned for a rural lock-up in Mumeng during his term. In 2021, the Marape-Basil government reportedly allocated K50 million for a lock-up and rehabilitation centre in Mumeng, with land secured, but construction never proceeded following Basil’s passing in 2022. An inmate from Bulolo, Alfred Lua Manak, who has served seven years at Buimo, spoke on behalf of the 102 inmates from the district. He urged the current Bulolo MP, Sam Basil Jr, to revive his late father’s plan. “I’m sure this plan was already there with your father and now you’re here, I would like to request again for Bulolo to have its own lock-up in the district, a court and our own judge,” Manak said. “That’s our only request.” Wundia also urged the government that in the next 50 years, all districts in Morobe should look at setting up a rural lockup to ease the burden on Buimo.",CorrectionalService,Sadness,Sam Basil,The National
Work on Bomana sewerage plant nearing completion,https://www.thenational.com.pg/work-on-bomana-sewerage-plant-nearing-completion/,25/09/2025,"CONSTRUCTION work on the Bomana sewerage plant outside the Correctional Service minimum prison wing is nearing completion, says a contractor. Lome Paina Construction managing director Jacob Walo said construction was 50 per cent done with the laying of pipes this week. “Despite having issues with funding, we have now secured the piping before we can start work on building the sewerage,” he said. “There will be three chambers. “The pipes have been strengthened by couplings and tested for leakage. “Once the chambers are built, the tap to the previous manhole will be closed off to let the sewerage flow to the new plant. “We are also looking at installing a pump at the back of the minimum prison but that is not within the project scope. “The pump will accommodate flushing out the waste because the sewerage is in low grounds.” The contractor procured 250 ml diameter pipes which had been laid through to the main hole. The total cost of the septic tank is at K1.6 million and the size will be doubled from the previous of 15 times 20 meters in diameter to 20 by 40 meters. The height of the chambers will be at 3.5 meters and is estimated to last more than 50 years. “A second hole will be constructed at the end of the chambers to act a waste outlet,” Walo said. “An existing main hole which sits next to the current strainer are clogged and will be replaced and pipes removed and diverted once the new septic is built.” CS officials were also on hand to check on the project and to ensure the project was working within its timeframe of 12 months. Over the years the stench had caused health issues to the community and was near a state of being condemned. CS Assistant Commissioner policy planning and evaluation Francesca Marenge said upon two site checks, the contractor was up to date with his work. “In terms of funding, that is slow but the contractor is keeping in pace with whatever resources he has available, and that’s the main point.

Rehabilitation of NCD’s Rainbow road launched,https://www.thenational.com.pg/rehabilitation-of-ncds-rainbow-road-launched/,25/09/2025,"RAINBOW Village in Gerehu will have two entry and exit roads constructed to aid traffic for residents, says National Capital District Commission (NCDC) Governor Powes Parkop. Parkop said this rehabilitation will start along the current entrance into Rainbow, taking the first turn left at the back of the Mobil Service Station and continuing left to the end of the road. “We are rehabilitating that part of the road due to years of neglect by former MPs,” he said. “This project will see some additions to entry and exit points so we control the traffic as right now it is highly congested. “Over the years, some of the poor drainage had contributed to the road eroding and so we will fix it now. “This is a small intervention that we hope can make a bigger contribution to the quality of life and wellbeing here in Rainbow.” Parkop said this road within Rainbow had been here 15 years, and the rehabilitation was long- time coming. Part of the rehabilitation will have an entry and exit point parallel to Port Moresby National High School and one towards the back streets of Rainbow. This will reopen the access parallel to Nautana towards the back of Gerehu. City manager Frank Ravu said this was a very important road to be rehabilitated as the areas housed many public servants and private sector workers and he thanked the NCDC Board and Government for availing funds to this project. Government Chief Secretary Ivan Pomaleu was invited as a resident of the Rainbow. He had submitted part proposal to the NCDC to look into fixing the roads on behalf of the rainbow community. Contractor Reinhold Engineering project manager Fitzgerald Bob said the rehabilitation costing was at K5.6 million and would cater for road works, sealing, drainage and other infrastructure work. The designated road is a collector road that is a feeder to smaller roads within Rainbow. Over the years, the condition of the road has eroded, causing large drenches in the road, affecting flow of traffic and flooding during wet season. He said the current road where the rehabilitation work would start stretched 780 meters in length.

"PNG’s youth unemployment a prevalent challenge, says ILO",https://www.thenational.com.pg/pngs-youth-unemployment-a-prevalent-challenge-says-ilo/,25/09/2025,"THE International Labour Organisation (ILO) has highlighted youth unemployment as a prevalent challenge affecting much of Papua New Guinea’s labour market. In its country report last year, the ILO – a United Nations specialised agency dealing with work and workplace issues, and related rights and standards – stated that youth unemployment in PNG was about three times higher than for the general population. “Youth unemployment is about three times higher than for the general population, largely due to the low absorption of school leavers into the formal employment sector,” the ILO report said. “A growing number of children are engaged in the worst forms of child labour, illicit activities and hazardous work. “Many children below the age of 18 work as domestic servants, on plantations, and in the tourism industry.” It stated that the unemployment rate was 2.7 per cent and rising to 3.8 per cent for the youth in the country, with 27.7 per cent of this demographic in education, employment, or training. Meanwhile, ILO also highlighted that challenges were pervasive in the country’s labour market which has a participation rate of 52 per cent, which includes the informal economy. “A large proportion of the workforce are in informal and subsistence agriculture,” it said. “Over half of the those working in formal wage employment are in the services sector at 53.7 per cent, followed with 38.6 per cent in agriculture and 7.6 per cent in industry. “The private sector accounts for more than 90 per cent of employment, however employment expansion is constrained by infrastructure problems and relatively low labour productivity. “The recent investments in developing infrastructure have supported growth in formal employment, but also created shortages of skilled labour.”",Economy,Sadness,Nill,The National
Marape urges world leaders to act on preserving forests,https://www.thenational.com.pg/marape-urges-world-leaders-to-act-on-preserving-forests/,25/09/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has urged the international community to act decisively to protect the planet’s forests, oceans and biodiversity, warning that humanity is “borrowing our children’s future” through unsustainable lifestyles. Speaking at a high-level side meeting during the United Nations (UN) General Assembly on unlocking nature finance at Cop30, Marape addressed a gathering of environmental practitioners and partners focused on concrete action. He drew attention to the uniqueness of Earth in the cosmos, stressing that no other planet could sustain human life. “Look 96 billion light years into the observable universe – there is no other planet like ours,” he said. “It does not matter what Elon Musk or others may pursue on Mars, we will never find another Earth. It is better to save this planet than to search for life elsewhere.” The prime minister cautioned that human activity had pushed the Earth close to irreversible damage. “We live at a point in history where human impact on nature is at its maximum tilt,” he said. “If we do not reverse the way we live, our children and grandchildren will not inherit the same comfortable Earth that we enjoy today. We may one day be forced to carry bottled oxygen, just as we now fight over water.” Marape anchored his message in faith, recalling the Book of Genesis and God’s command that humans act as stewards, not destroyers, of creation. “For thousands of years, that balance was maintained. It is only in the last 200 years that mankind’s footprint has caused major damage. We must now take responsibility,” he said. He noted that astronauts who look back at Earth from space often experience what is called the “overview effect” – the sudden realisation of the planet’s fragility. “Neil Armstrong must have felt it in 1969 when he stood on the moon and longed to return to the only blue planet we have,” he said. Marape highlighted Papua New Guinea’s critical role as custodian of one of the world’s last remaining great rainforests and its vast marine biodiversity. “Papua New Guinea is almost 80 per cent forested, and our coral reefs are among the richest on Earth,” he said. “Together with the Amazon, the Congo Basin, and Indonesia, PNG represents one of the final frontiers of tropical rainforest preservation. “These forests are not just a PNG asset – they belong to humanity.” Marape recounted how UN secretary-general António Guterres, during his visit to PNG earlier this month, was “amazed” to witness the scale of the country’s intact forests after flying hours into the interior. “Our forests and oceans are carbon sinks, oxygen producers and biodiversity homes. To lose them is to lose balance on Earth itself.” Marape explained PNG’s efforts to tax loggers, curb unsustainable harvesting and dedicate up to 72 per cent of its landmass to permanent rainforest preservation. But he stressed that without global partnerships, the temptation for landowners to trade forests for quick cash would persist. “Ninety-seven per cent of our land is owned by our people. “They want to protect it, but they are tempted by immediate gains,” he said. “We need investors and sponsors to work with us so that preserving forests becomes more valuable than cutting them down.” Marape said PNG had already increased logging taxes to as high as 72 per cent before settling back to 48 per cent to deter exploitation. “We are serious about protecting our forests, but we need partners who will assist us in conserving this global asset.” Marape gave a stark reminder of the stakes. “This is our one planet. If the balance is broken, we are not just losing trees or oceans – we are losing Earth itself. “Across 96 billion light years of the universe, there is no other home for humanity. It is better to save this one.”",Environment,Fear,James Marape,The National

Smith said the team has two recovery sites and 12 investigations sites in Morobe, East New Britain, Northern and New Ireland. He said at the crash site of the bomber was also where they recovered two remains. With the help of locals, the team was able to pinpoint several sites in Northern that are now going to transition into recovery sites.” “We’re also bringing in remains from a partner mission in New Ireland,” Smith added. Tourism Minister Belden Namah said as a former military officer he understands what it means to never leave a comrade behind. Namah thanked the team for their tireless efforts in investigating and recovering the remains with the support of PNGDF and other agencies. “Their remains will also remind us of the human cost of war and that we must all times pursue the path of peace and harmony,” Namah said. He also thanked locals in the provinces for keeping safe the sites where the remains lay for the last 80 years. US ambassador Ann Marie Yastishock said they do not only honour their service and sacrifice but also the commitment by the US to make every effort to bring them home. “This gives peace and closure to the families of more than 3,000 members who went missing in PNG,” she said. “They may have lost their lives but they are never forgotten. Each recovery is a testament to that unyielding promise that we will never forget.”  Yastishock said this mission was not just about recovery it was about community providing direct economic benefit to the region.",History,Trust,Belden Namah,The National

N’Dranou filed the case against Manning and the State. Judge Susan Purdon-Sully ruled in Waigani on Aug 20 that N’Dranou’s application for leave to apply for judicial review, filed on June 10, be granted. “N’Dranou shall file a notice of motion within 14 days,” she said. “Within 21 days, he shall serve on the defendants a Notice of Motion for substantive judicial review together with its Originating Summons for leave and all supporting documents with this order.” Judge Purdon-Sully said that it was unchallenged that N’Dranou was employed under a three year performance-based contract of employment which expired on Jan 18, 2018. The court heard that on Feb 6, N’Dranou was directed by Manning to continue his employment with the police force as ACP (training) and National Centre of Excellence commandant. N’Dranou’s employment was terminated by a letter from Manning dated May 21, 2025. In making the decision, N’Dranou asserted that Manning acted ultra vires or in error of law, breached the principles of natural justice and that the decision was harsh and oppressive. The relief sought by N’Dranou as pleaded in his Statement in Support filed on June 10, claimed that the decision be quashed, a declaration that his termination was void and of no legal effect, a declaration that Manning had appointed him to continue his employment which for all purposes was an appointment under the Police Act 1998 and an order in the nature of mandamus directing Manning to re-instate him. Judge Purdon-Sully said in opposing the grant of leave, the only issue raised by the State was whether the plaintiff had met the requirement that he had an arguable case. “It was the State’s case inter alia that the plaintiff’s performance-based contract of employment had expired, that it was to the contract of employment that he must look and for this reason judicial review and reinstatement he sought by way of relief were not remedies available to him,” she said.",Law,Anticipation,Nill,The National

The international research team, working on the German vessel RV Sonne found that seafloor vents have been releasing methane, ethane, propane, and butane gases – a clear evidence of a working petroleum system in the New Ireland Basin. It confirms that natural gas and condensate liquids are being generated from coal-rich source rocks and are actively seeping to the seafloor. Konabe, who participated as a shipboard scientist and named the newly discovered vent field Karambusel said: “I chose the name Karambusel because of the remarkable mussel beds discovered at the site. “It is the first time these animals have been found living alongside active natural gas seepage in PNG, making it a special discovery for our country.” Espi, the head of UPNG’s Earth Sciences Division, said: “Our involvement in international research ensures PNG has both a stronger understanding of its offshore geology and a direct role in major natural resource discoveries.” PEAK Oil PNG Pty Ltd country manager Michael Nongkas welcomed the findings. “As a New Irelander, this discovery is especially meaningful. It independently confirms the hydrocarbon potential in our province and opens the door to new opportunities in jobs, training, and long-term economic sustainability,” he said. PEAK Oil PNG Pty Ltd holds the petroleum prospecting licences covering the discovery area, positioning the company to further advance exploration in partnership with local stakeholders, government, and the international resource sector. The publication of the find in Scientific Reports is particularly significant because the journal is freely available online and read by millions of scientists, policymakers, and industry leaders worldwide each month. This ensures that the New Ireland Basin discovery will gain global visibility, raising PNG’s profile in both the international scientific and resource development sectors.",Business,Anticipation,Nill,The National
Improve conditions first: Economist,https://www.thenational.com.pg/improve-conditions-first-economist/,24/09/2025,"IMPROVING the conditions of doing business in the country is needed before the new minimum wage rate comes into effect from next year, an economist says. Institute of National Affairs executive director Paul Barker said good governance and the adherence to the rule of law would benefit employers to implement the new rates recently announced by the Minimum Wages Board. “It should also be recognised that many businesses, be it in the formal sector, some foreign-owned or with foreign beneficial owners in the retail or aspects of the resources sector, are operating in a seemingly unregulated sector,” he said. “They are not applying the minimum wages, let alone paying company or payroll taxes, or superannuation in the process keeping their costs down, but gaining unfair competitive advantage over other local businesses. “While these firms have been bypassing PNG’s rules, the Government itself has recently endorsed such inconsistent preferential arrangements for selected beneficiary firms, even in urban centres. “Under the Special Economic Zone arrangements, selected firms would bypass many standards taxes, including a portion of salary and wages and other taxes and aspects of labour and environmental laws, undermining the principle of a level playing field, and undermining government revenue, even from businesses that could readily pay. “Thus, weak application of governance and the rule of law and a wide application of corrupt practices, at the high level, as well as petty corruption, all undermine business prospects.” Barker said that improved conditions would lower costs and investment in productivity to enhance competitiveness, hence, improving the capacity of businesses to pay competitive wages, incentives, household incomes, welfare and savings. He added that the new minimum wage rate of K5 per hour would not support workers in the country once it comes into effect, especially those in urban areas. “The minimum wage set at K5 per hour (or K400 per fortnight) and rising to K5.50 (in 2027) (K440 per fortnight) is not a decent living wage for an adult in a city, if they also have a family to support.”",Business,Anger,Nill,The National

Chamber president John Byrne congratulated the Minimum Wages Board for a comprehensive and balanced consultation process around the country over several months. He said that the board, made up of industry and government, union representatives were open and unbiased in their conversations, taking on board all opinions with respect and fairness. “The outcome of an increase of the minimum wage threshold to K5 from January 1 2026, and incremental increases in 2027 and 2028, is reasonable and sets a proper platform for our people,” he said. “It is important for our working staff to be made aware that this increase applies only to those on the minimum wage (of K3.50 per hour) currently. “Most of our LCCI employers pay rates (and benefits) are in excess of the minimum wage already. These wage and salary structures will remain fixed.” He said the board hearings highlighted a challenge by businesses – the grey-market which did not pay minimum wages, statutory taxes, licences, superannuation and staff benefits. “It is critical for our people and country that we take on the challenge of addressing these operators, and the Lae and PNG Chambers of Commerce are keen to address this major impediment to our people, competition and service improvements,” he said. “It is taxes that funds roads, power and other vital services and these illegal operators must be addressed ensuring our people are paid and rewarded appropriately and proper taxes are also paid.” He said that this provided a platform to protect staff currently on minimum wages, while holding cost pressures on goods and product at the stores, businesses, and services.",Business,Trust,Nill,The National

The eight provinces are Hela, Southern Highlands, Enga, Western Highlands, Jiwaka, Chimbu, Eastern Highlands and Morobe. In 12 provinces, they will be elected by the people. The 12 provinces are Madang, East Sepik, West Sepik, Northern, Milne Bay, Central, Gulf, Western, Manus, New Ireland, West New Britain and East New Britain.

Education Minister Lucas Dekena made this remark during the launching at the Popondetta Independence Oval on Monday. “This is the first time the province has hosted such an important ministry conference, and it also marks the first senior education officers conference to be held after the nation’s 50th Independence anniversary. “By being here in Popondetta, we are also sending a strong message that education is for every province, every district, every ward and every family. “No child should be left behind, no matter where they are,” Dekena said. He reaffirmed the Government’s commitment under the national education plan 2020–2029 to ensuring that every child has access to quality education pathways. “We must ensure that every child has a clear and viable pathway from early childhood to fulfilling a career. “This means strengthening foundational learning, making schools safe and inclusive, empowering teachers and expanding alternate pathways through Fode, Tvet, and higher learning,” Dekena said. Northern Governor Gary Juffa, complementing the Minister’s message, called for a “great reset in education” as the country enters its next 50 years. “The world is changing rapidly with artificial intelligence and new technologies. “Are we preparing our children to be not only citizens of PNG, but global citizens who can contribute meaningfully to the world?” Juffa asked. He further encouraged teachers to speak openly on the issues affecting them and not to hold back. Both leaders stressed that Papua New Guinean children were brilliant and full of potential and realising this required empowered teachers, bold reforms and united action. The conference, with the theme “Accessible education pathways for all”, has brought together more than 100 senior education officers to discuss strategies to improve the education system in the country.",Education,Anticipation,"Gary Juffa, Lucas Dekena",The National
"Growing PNG my focus from the beginning, says Marape",https://www.thenational.com.pg/growing-png-my-focus-from-the-beginning-says-marape/,24/09/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has reaffirmed that growing Papua New Guinea’s economy has been his central focus since first assuming office on May 30, 2019, and remains the cornerstone of his vision for the country’s long-term prosperity. “From my first speech as prime minister in 2019, I made it clear that the focus of my leadership would be to grow the economy so that we have more resources to sustain our people,” Marape said in a statement. “I spoke about our journey toward becoming the richest black Christian nation, which is in line with the ambitions first laid out by Prime Minister Somare for a happy, wealthy, wise and top 50 nation by 2050. I chose a more aggressive approach to ensure every ministry, department and public servant prioritises economic growth.” Marape said the rationale was simple: a bigger economy provides the resources to fund education, healthcare, infrastructure, welfare and national development. “When I took office, the economy stood at K79 billion. Today, six years on, we are at K130 billion — a growth of over K50 billion. This has happened despite many challenges,” he noted. “Our growth rate is now consistently above four per cent — higher than many other economies. Independent observers such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Asian Development Bank have all forecast PNG’s growth at over four per cent this year.” Marape emphasised that economic growth is the pathway to economic independence — a mission inspired by the late Sir Michael Somare’s words in 2007, when he told a younger Marape and his colleagues that their generation of educated leaders must work towards economic sovereignty, just as his generation delivered political independence in 1975. “Somare’s generation gave us political independence,” Marape said. “It is now our generation’s duty to deliver economic independence.” Marape reaffirmed his ambitious growth targets: “No previous prime minister has spoken about growing the economy to this scale. But it must be done, because a larger economy is the only way to sustain our fast-growing population,” Marape said. He outlined that growth will come from across all sectors — forestry, fisheries, agriculture, mining, petroleum, and, critically, through local content, small-to-medium enterprise and wider participation of Papua New Guineans in business.",Business,Trust,"James Marape, Michael Somare",The National
Counter terrorism measures employed in response to unrest,https://www.thenational.com.pg/counter-terrorism-measures-employed-in-response-to-unrest/,24/09/2025,"TWO hundred security personnel have been deployed to Nipa-Kutubu in the Southern Highlands to quell damage and blockage of the Highlands Highway by tribesmen. This followed reports that locals had dug up the highway and halted traffic flow in protest against the sidelining of Kumul Petroleum Holdings chief executive officer Wapu Sonk by the board of the entity last week. Sonk is a local of the area. Police Commissioner David Manning said: “I have authorised the use of measures available under the Counter-Terrorism Act, and approved counter-terrorism operations to remove this threat to our national security. “Two hundred law enforcement personnel are deployed in Nipa-Kutubu and adjoining areas. “These personnel are afforded the powers and protections of the Counter-Terrorism Act to undertake their duties, and do so with the full support of Government.” Yesterday police claimed calm has been restored and the Highlands Highway reopened in the Nipa-Kutubu district. Manning said: “The destruction of critical infrastructure such as a major roadway to compel government action is an act of terrorism. “The actions of this group are unacceptable and unlawful. Their actions in damaging critical infrastructure risks the lives of our communities who rely upon this roadway for goods and services as well as access to medical care. “The Prime Minister made his expectations clear, to stop lawless behaviour in Nipa-Kutubu, and under my direction the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary and PNG Defence Force have achieved this outcome. “Calm was promptly restored over the weekend and the highway repaired. “Those who sought to hold the nation to ransom are now the subject of ongoing counter-terrorism operations.” Manning said the second phase is to address any remaining threats in this region. He added that surveillance, financial analysis and targeted tactical operations were underway, and would continue throughout the operation in Southern Highlands. “These targeted operations not only address those responsible for these acts of terrorism, but also form part of our operations to provide a secure environment for our communities ahead of the 2027 general elections. “This is part of a long-term commitment by police and PNGDF to remove from our communities those that present a threat to the rule of law. “This operation will continue over the coming months.” The Police Commissioner commended frontline members for the swift response and said now is the time for targeted operations to be implemented against those who sought to terrorise and hold to ransom the nation and those who supported such acts.",Politics,Anger,Nill,The National

Kikori MP and Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs Minister Soroi Eoe said: “About 80 per cent of people in the rural areas deserve the same rights as those in urban areas and when leaders are in a positon to help, then do so. “Over the last five years, there have been so many deaths of locals travelling the River Rhine along the West Coast just to get out to access basic services and in search of markets for their produce,” he said. Eoe and his staff and other passengers set sail on MV IBK (Ihu, Baimuru and Kikori) yesterday on her maiden trip to the west Gulf areas. The landing barge is named after the three local level Government areas of West Gulf and is operating under the Kikori District Development Authority (DDA). It was purchased mid-this year to improve sea transport for passengers and cargo, including market produce between Port Moresby and Gulf. The transport system in Kikori, Ihu, Baimuru and other parts of Gulf, is primarily reliant on water due to the district’s riverine and coastal geography. However, recent initiatives are improving road access and sea transport options. “The west coast’s extensive river system necessitates reliance on boats and dinghies for movement in the district and to access other areas. “It is also a coastal area, requiring boats for travel to and from other coastal communities and potentially for accessing markets in Port Moresby,” Eoe said. When commissioning the barge last month, Prime Minster James Marape said this was a start in bringing Kikori and other parts of Gulf up to par in line with other districts around the country. He said western Gulf was an important strategic part of PNG and had been marginalised but despite this called for patience.",Politics,Trust,"James Marape, Soroi Eoe",The National

The airstrip, once serviced by Tropic Air through Kokopo’s Tokua Airport, has not had flights since Sept 2023. This was after the Tokua Airport terminal was vandalised and looted by criminals, destroying computers, which in turn forced the suspension of flights to Jacquinot Bay. Before its closure, charter flights from Tokua landed at Jacquinot Bay three times a week. Pomio MP Elias Kapavore toldThe Nationalthat since the incident at Tokua, the people of Pomio had faced many challenges. “From Tokua to here is 45 minutes,” he said. “In the past, it was easier and faster to travel to Pomio, by plane.Now we only travel here by ship.” Kapavore said that the district had to compromise by buying two ships to help people travel. Travel delays also affected public servants, prompting the district to buy a 500-horsepower boat to make trips faster. Kapavore said the upgraded Jacquinot Bay Airstrip runway will be 1.7km long. The airstrip, previously managed by the Rural Airstrip Agency (RAA) would now operate under the National Airports Corporation (NAC). The contractor for the project is Niugini Engineering and Procurement Services (NEPS) Construction and K1.4 million from provincial services improvement programme (PSIP) funds was released for early work, with more support expected from the national government under the Civil Aviation Development Improvement Programme (Cadip 2). Kapavore said the Pomio development authority (DDA) had approved and allocated K1. 5 million for the upgrading of the Jacquinot Bay Airstrip. The K1.5 million funding comes from the Pomio services improvement programme (DSIP) funds. “Pomio will make available K1.5 million and it will be presented to the company,” Kapavore said. He noted that the upgrade would allow bigger planes to use the runway. “Generally, this place will be sealed up to pavement, right across the runaway and even the carpark area, and the terminal will be upgraded,” he said. Kapavore said that Pomio had more than four airstrips. Two had already been opened, and work will continue with RAA to upgrade and maintain all of them.

However, like any country, our journey has not been without its trials. Today, as we celebrate half a century of independence, we are reminded of both the achievements and the challenges that have shaped our nation’s story. Over the past five decades, Papua New Guinea has made significant strides in development. From advancements in education and healthcare to improvements in infrastructure, our nation has risen from the ashes of colonial rule to establish its own identity. Yet, we cannot ignore the shadows that linger in the form of corruption, social inequality, and a system that at times feels disconnected from the needs of the people. These challenges – some deeply ingrained in our society – have hindered progress, slowed economic growth and created division among us. But this is not the time to dwell solely on the negatives. It is the time to look forward with hope and resolve. It is the time to recognise that change starts with us. Every citizen, every community, every individual has a role to play in building a better future for PNG. We must be united in our vision for the future. While our nation’s problems are complex, they are not insurmountable – Unity is the key. Our diverse cultures, languages, and traditions are not a barrier, but rather a strength that sets us apart from the world. We must celebrate this diversity and harness it as a tool for progress. It is time for all of us to come together – not as individuals or political parties, but as one united nation, driven by a shared vision of a prosperous future. We must reject corruption. Corruption has plagued our institutions for far too long. It has robbed us of opportunities, trust, and the future we deserve. But change is possible, and it starts with us holding ourselves accountable. By demanding transparency and integrity, by choosing leaders who prioritise the people over personal gain, we can begin to reclaim our nation’s future. We must invest in education and the youth. The next 50 years will be defined by the generations we nurture today. Our youth are our most precious resource, and it is crucial that we invest in their education, skills and aspirations. They are the builders of tomorrow, the ones who will carry forward the mantle of leadership. Let us ensure they have the tools they need to succeed – be it through access to quality education, opportunities for employment, or platforms for their voices to be heard. We must protect our environment. Our land, our seas, our resources – Papua New Guinea’s natural beauty is unparalleled. But with this beauty comes a responsibility to protect and preserve it for future generations. Sustainable development is the only path forward. We must balance progress with preservation, ensuring that our environment remains a source of prosperity for all. As we celebrate 50 years of independence, let us also pledge to work together for a better tomorrow. The road ahead may be challenging, but we are resilient. We are capable. And we are united in our love for this land we call home. Papua New Guinea is not defined by its past; it is defined by what we choose to make of its future. Let this 50th anniversary be a moment of awakening, a moment of action, and a moment of unity. We all have a role to play in the story of PNG – let us write it with integrity, hope, and a shared commitment to a brighter future for all. Happy 50th Independence Day, Papua New Guinea! Let us celebrate the strength, resilience and potential that lies within us all. John Wadidika",Nation,Trust,Nill,The National
"Handshakes, trade and Palestine as PM takes world stage",https://www.thenational.com.pg/handshakes-trade-and-palestine-as-pm-takes-world-stage/,24/09/2025,"Canberra: Australia has used a United Nations meeting to try to revive a long-stalled major trade deal, after formally recognising Palestine as a state. Anthony Albanese met with French President Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly for a 40-minute sit-down in New York on Tuesday, Australian time. In an address to the summit of world leaders, the prime minister reiterated Australia’s support for an end to the war between Israel and Hamas, and a two-state solution. Albanese compared the plight of Palestinians to that of the Jews before the creation of Israel. “In recognising Palestine, Australia recognises the legitimate and long-held aspirations of the Palestinian people,” he said. “It means real hope for a place they can call home. “This is the same hope that sustained generations of Jewish people.” Albanese and Macron also discussed progress on the previously stalled free trade agreement negotiations with the EU, and Australia’s bid to jointly co-host the COP31 climate conference with Pacific countries. The pair also talked about their nations’ co-operation on issues including support for Ukraine, the renewable energy transition and the Indo-Pacific. The prime minister met with other leaders including his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and European Council President Antonio Costa. During the two-state solution conference at the UN, Albanese urged the Israeli government to “accept its share of responsibility” for the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. France was among a swathe of other countries that used the UN General Assembly session to recognise Palestine including the UK, Canada, Portugal, Malta and Andorra. More than 150 UN states, or more than three-quarters of the global body’s membership now recognise Palestinian statehood. But Australia faces pushback from 25 US Republicans who suggest “punitive measures” could be imposed on countries that have moved forward with recognition. The grouping of Israel supporters, including former presidential candidate Ted Cruz, said countries choosing to recognise Palestine were “rewarding terrorism”.

Trump calls climate change the ‘greatest con job’,https://www.thenational.com.pg/trump-calls-climate-change-the-greatest-con-job/,24/09/2025,"New York City: President Donald Trump dismissed climate change as “the greatest con job” in the world during his address to the United Nations General Assembly, doubling down on his scepticism of global environmental initiatives and multilateral institutions. Scientists say climate change is real, mostly caused by humans, and getting worse. They point to rising temperatures, stronger storms, and melting ice as clear signs. Groups like the UN have warned that waiting too long to act could cause serious damage to the planet and people. Trump spoke for several minutes out of his near-hour speech on Tuesday on climate change during his address to the United Nations General Assembly, criticising the European Union for reducing its carbon footprint, which he claimed has taken a toll on its economy, and warning countries that have invested heavily in renewable energy that their economies will suffer. “It’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” Trump told the General Assembly. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong.” He added: “They were made by stupid people that have cost their country’s fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success.” Once Trump took office in January, the US submitted its withdrawal for a second time from the Paris Agreement, a 2015 pact agreed by 195 countries to strive to keep global temperatures from rising beyond 1.5 C, leaving it in the company of only Yemen, Iran and Libya. His administration is carrying out an “energy dominance” agenda that focuses on producing and exporting oil, gas and coal, as well as nuclear, while sidelining renewable energy, which has become cost-competitive. “We have the most oil of any nation anywhere, oil and gas in the world, and if you add coal, we have the most of any nation in the world,” he said. His remarks come a day before UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hosts a climate summit at the UN that will focus on countries’ new climate action plans. Guterres has tried to keep the world focused on continuing a global transition away from fossil fuels towards clean energy. “Just follow the money,” Guterres said in June, adding that US$2 trillion (about K8 trillion) flowed into clean energy last year, US$800 billion (about K3.3 trillion) more than fossil fuels and up almost 70 per cent in a decade.

"Super Typhoon Ragasa lashes HK, 14 dead in Taiwan",https://www.thenational.com.pg/super-typhoon-ragasa-lashes-hk-14-dead-in-taiwan/,24/09/2025,"Hong Kong: Super Typhoon Ragasa, the world’s most powerful tropical cyclone this year, is lashing Hong Kong with hurricane-force winds and torrential rain, while heavy downpours in Taiwan resulted in the deaths of 14 people. A barrier lake in Taiwan’s eastern Hualien county overflowed and sent a wall of water into a town, as heavy rains from Ragasa battered the island, the Taiwan fire department said on Wednesday. Since Monday, Taiwan has been hit by the outer rim of Ragasa, which has brought torrential rains to the island. In Hong Kong, roads were deserted as authorities instructed people to stay indoors and surging waves crashed over parts of the Asian financial hub’s eastern and southern shoreline. “Areas which were previously sheltered may become exposed … seas will be phenomenal with swells,” the observatory said. Ragasa, packing winds of up to 200km/h, will be closest to the city in the next few hours, around 100km south of the densely populated territory. It is expected to maintain super typhoon intensity as it moves toward the coast of China’s Guangdong province, home to more than 125 million people, where it is expected to make landfall from midday to late on Wednesday. Ragasa swept through the northern Philippines on Monday and Taiwan on Tuesday. The typhoon sparked panic buying this week in Hong Kong, with people crowding into supermarkets, leaving little on the shelves and in some cases queuing for hours to purchase goods amid fears that shops could be closed for two days. As the typhoon approached, residents taped their windows in the hope of reducing the risk of injury from shattered glass. Hong Kong issued the typhoon signal 10, its highest warning, early on Wednesday, which urges businesses and transport services to shut down. Authorities also issued the Amber rainstorm signal, as heavy rain was expected to continue, with some streets already partially flooded, according to the South China Morning Post. Authorities have warned of rising sea levels, saying they could be similar to those seen during Typhoon Hato in 2017 and Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018, both of which caused billions of dollars in damage. “The water level will reach the maximum around noon (2pm AEST),” generally to around four metres,” the observatory said. A woman and her five-year-old son were swept into the ocean on Tuesday after watching the typhoon from the waterfront, according to the SCMP, which said they were now in intensive care after being rescued. The government said it had opened 49 temporary shelters in various districts and 727 people have sought refuge at the shelters. Hong Kong’s Stock Exchange will remain open. It changed its policy late last year to continue trading whatever the weather. Guangdong authorities have evacuated over 770,000 people, state broadcaster CCTV said. In the gambling hub of Macau next to Hong Kong, authorities also issued the No. 10 warning signal early on Wednesday. Source: Reuters",Weather,Fear,Nill,The National
NATO warns Russia to stop ‘escalatory’ actions,https://www.thenational.com.pg/nato-warns-russia-to-stop-escalatory-actions/,24/09/2025,"Brussels: Nato has warned Russia it will use “all necessary military and non-military tools” to defend itself as it condemned Moscow for violating Estonian airspace in a “pattern of increasingly irresponsible behaviour”. The warning came after Estonia said on Friday that three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes before Nato Italian fighter jets escorted them out. The week before, some 20 Russian drones entered Polish airspace, prompting Nato jets to shoot some of them down and the alliance to beef up the defence of Europe’s eastern flank. US President Donald Trump appeared to come out in favour of a robust Nato response to any future incursions as he spoke to reporters at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday. Asked whether Nato countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their airspace, he told reporters: “Yes, I do”. The Nato statement followed a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, made up of ambassadors from the alliance’s 32 member countries, which was called after Estonia invoked Article 4 of Nato’s founding treaty. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth held a call with Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur on Tuesday and told him that Washington “stands with all Nato allies and that any incursion into Nato airspace is unacceptable”, the Pentagon said in a statement. Hegseth “commended the quick response by European allies’ air defences”, the Pentagon said, adding he told his Estonian counterpart that Washington was closely tracking the situation. “Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives. They must stop,” the council said in a statement. Source: Reuters",Politics,Fear,Nill,The National
Who stopped the UN escalator? Likely a Trump staffer,https://www.thenational.com.pg/who-stopped-the-un-escalator-likely-a-trump-staffer/,24/09/2025,"UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations believes it has solved the mystery of why an escalator abruptly stopped shortly after US President Donald Trump stepped onto it – his videographer may have accidentally triggered a safety mechanism. Trump jokingly complained about the incident during his speech to world leaders earlier on Tuesday after the teleprompter also didn’t work. “These are the two things I got from the United Nations – a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,” he told the 193-member assembly, to some laughter. However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wasn’t so lighthearted about it. “If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately,” she posted on X after the incident. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said a readout of the escalator’s central processing unit indicated it “had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator”. He said Trump’s videographer had been travelling backwards up the escalator to capture his arrival with First Lady Melania Trump. “The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function,” Dujarric said in a statement. “The safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the UN findings. On the teleprompter, Trump told the General Assembly: “I can only say that whoever’s operating this teleprompter is in big trouble.” However, a UN official said the White House had operated its own teleprompter. After Trump finished speaking, UN General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock said: “The UN teleprompters are working perfectly”. Source: Reuters",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National
"Trump unleashes at UN, countries are ‘going to hell’",https://www.thenational.com.pg/trump-unleashes-at-un-countries-are-going-to-hell/,24/09/2025,"New York City: President Donald Trump has castigated the United Nations as a feckless institution in a speech to world leaders, praising America under his leadership while warning Europe will be ruined if it doesn’t turn away from a “double-tailed monster” of ill-conceived migration and green energy policies. His roughly hour-long speech before the UN General Assembly on Tuesday was both grievance-filled and self-congratulatory as he used the platform to applaud his second-term achievements and lament that some of his fellow world leaders’ countries were “going to hell”. The address was the latest reminder for US allies and foes that the United States has returned to an unapologetically “America First” posture with an antagonistic view toward the United Nations. Trump also sharply criticised the global body for inaction, saying it was filled with “empty words” that “don’t solve wars”. “What is the purpose of the United Nations?” Trump asked. “The UN has such tremendous potential. I’ve always said it. It has such tremendous, tremendous potential. But it’s not even coming close to living up to that potential.” Afterward, Trump attempted to assuage fears from some diplomats by assuring the top UN leader that the US remained “100 per cent” supportive of the global body despite his earlier criticism. “I may disagree with it sometimes, but I am so behind it because the potential for peace at this institution is great,” Trump told Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. It was another about-face after Trump offered a weave of jarring juxtapositions in his address to the assembly. He trumpeted himself as a peacemaker and enumerated successes of his administration’s efforts in several hotspots around the globe. At the same time, Trump heralded his decisions to order the US military to carry out strikes on Iran and more recently against alleged drug smugglers from Venezuela and argued that “globalists” are on the verge of destroying successful nations. Trump touted his administration’s policies allowing for expanded drilling for oil and natural gas and aggressively cracking down on illegal immigration. He warned that European nations that have more welcoming migration policies and commit to expensive energy projects aimed at reducing their carbon footprint were causing irreparable harm to their economies and cultures. “I’m telling you that if you don’t get away from the ‘green energy’ scam, your country is going to fail,” Trump said. “If you don’t stop people that you’ve never seen before that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail. “I love the people of Europe, and I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration. This double-tailed monster destroys everything in its wake, and they cannot let that happen any longer.” Trump also addressed Russia’s war in Ukraine, once again threatening to hit Moscow with “a very strong round of powerful tariffs” if Russian President Vladimir Putin didn’t end the war. After the speech he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to announce a dramatic shift in his position on the war: He said he now believes Ukraine, with the help of NATO, can win back all territory lost to Russia.

Asylum seeker jailed in case that sparked UK protests,https://www.thenational.com.pg/asylum-seeker-jailed-in-case-that-sparked-uk-protests/,24/09/2025,"London: An Ethiopian asylum seeker, whose arrest in July sparked angry protests outside the hotel near London where he and other migrants were being housed, has been jailed for 12 months for sexually assaulting a woman and a teenage girl. The protests outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, 30km north of the British capital, became a touchpaper for a string of country-wide demonstrations amid rising tensions over immigration. Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was convicted at Chelmsford Magistrates Court earlier in September of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman, attempting to sexually assault the girl, inciting her to engage in sexual activity and one count of harassment. Kebatu had acknowledged that he was aware of the unrest his offending had caused and that other law-abiding asylum seekers had been affected by it as it drew a response from the public not just in Epping but across the country, Judge Christopher Williams told him. “It resulted in mass demonstrations and the fear that children in the United Kingdom are not safe,” the judge said on Tuesday. Immigration has become the dominant political issue in Britain, eclipsing concerns over a faltering economy, as the country faces both a record number of asylum claims and arrivals by migrants in small boats across the Channel. Kebatu, who had arrived in Britain on a small boat and only moved to the Bell Hotel about a week before the incident, had denied all the accusations, saying he was “not a wild animal”. Just more than 32,000 migrants are housed in hotels across the country, according to figures up to the end of June. The government plans to stop the practice by the next election, due in 2029.

"Sudan cholera rate rising at ‘alarming’ rate, says UN",https://www.thenational.com.pg/sudan-cholera-rate-rising-at-alarming-rate-says-un/,24/09/2025,"Khartoum: The number of reported cholera cases is increasing in Darfur and more than 3,000 people across all of Sudan have died from the illness over the last 14 months of civil war, the UN health agency said. The current outbreak of the bacterial infection caused by contaminated food or water has spread to all 18 states in the war-torn country after erupting in Kassala in July last year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said. Hala Khudari, its deputy representative in Sudan, said the WHO has launched a vaccination campaign targeting 406,000 people in the state of North Darfur that comes “as cholera cases in Darfur continue to rise at an alarming rate – at an alarming fatality rate, to be specific”. As of Sunday, some 12,739 cases and 358 deaths have been reported in more than half of Darfur localities, she said. The outbreak reached Darfur in western Sudan in May. “Reported cases in Darfur continue to increase amid severe access constraints that are impeding the required scale of response,” Khudari told reporters in Geneva by video from Port Sudan. The conflict between the Sudanese military and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group erupted in April 2023 in Khartoum before spreading across the country. The civil war has killed at least 40,000 people and displaced as many as 12 million others, UN officials have said. Both sides have been accused of committing atrocities such as ethnic cleansing, extrajudicial killings and sexual violence against civilians, including children. Meanwhile, many people across Sudan have been pushed to the brink of famine. The conflict and increased movements of people who have fled the fighting have limited access to basic services such as clean water, food and healthcare. Overall, more than 113,600 cases and more than 3000 deaths have been reported from across the country, reaching a fatality ratio of 2.7 per cent, well above the one per cent target threshold, Khudari said.

National Court Judge Collin Makail yesterday heard the preliminary issues raised by parties and told the lawyers to ensure that peace and good order was maintained until the matter returned on Friday. “What is critical is for parties to respect the rule of law,” Judge Makail said. “Servants, agents and associates of the parties in the case should respect the rule of law and follow the due court process in order for the issue to be duly resolved,” he told representatives of both sides. Sonk filed the case against Registrar of Companies David Kil, recently-appointed KPHL board chairman Gerea Aopi and members Jacob Anga, George Gware and Sundaram Srinivasan. The amended originating summons was filed on Saturday. Sonk was represented by lawyers from Baniyamai Lawyers and Jonathan Holingu from Holingu Lawyers. Judge Makail said that the case was urgent but lawyers involved in the case should advise their clients, agents, associates and servants to respect the rule of law and maintain good order until the case was heard. “Any application for joinder shall be filed by Sept 24 and served to parties,” he said. Meanwhile, lawyer Dane Mel from Mel and Henry’s Lawyers also told the court that Prime Minister James Marape, in his capacity as the KPHL trustee, needed to be named as a party in the proceeding. Lawyer Robert Bradshaw representing chairman Aopi and the KPHL board told the court that Sonk was suspended on full pay and the court should consider not granting the relief sought in the interim after the leave was granted. Sonk is seeking a declaration that Kil has no power under the Companies Act to alter or amend the records of KPHL in the Companies Register with the Investment Promotion Authority (IPA), unless and until it is authorised to do so by the management of the company or its board secretary, and that the following decisions and actions of Kil are null and void and of no-effect.

Mirisim pushes for Frieda to start sooner,https://www.thenational.com.pg/mirisim-pushes-for-frieda-to-start-sooner/,23/09/2025,"ONE government minister is adamant that the Frieda River Copper and Gold project gets under way soonest. Telefomin MP and Works and Highways Minister Solan Mirisim says the project would drive development and progress for his remote district. “This is a major opportunity to overcome Telefomin’s long-standing isolation and with the town plan in place, the new roads and airport will connect the remote district to the northern coastal area, allowing for greater public transport and business activities for the people,” he said. He said landowner communities will also benefit from statutory payments such as royalties and compensation. Mirisim said he put this proposal to Prime Minister James Marape when launching the Telefomin township plan and the Tabubil to Telefomin highway on Sept 12. The township plan includes a new business development centre, a new runway for the Telefomin air strip, sealing of roads, introduction of postal services, building of office complex, new police office and public servants housing. This plan is set to cater for future investment opportunities should the government take on resource development, such as the Frieda project. Telefomin is bordered along the Hindenburg ridge which divides the OK Tedi mine along the star mountains of Western and Telefomin district. Mirisim said as parts of the mountain range had shown rich mineralization, it stood to reason to drive further exploration in the area. A 2018 feasibility study projected a long mine life of over 30 years for the Frieda river project. This facilitates a broader regional development for the Sepik region in bringing in the much-needed services and infrastructure to isolated communities, he said. PanAust Ltd acquired the project from Highylands Pacific in 2014 and proposes to operate the mine through its subsidiary Frieda River Ltd (FRL). It is a open cast mine and associated infrastructure will straddle both Sandaun and East Sepik provinces. “The project will establish infrastructure for power transmission, potentially providing electricity and fiber optic cable access to communities. “The people will benefit from direct and indirect employment opportunities, providing income and opportunities for skills development for local residents and improved access to markets via new infrastructure,” Mirisim said. He said this would foster the growth of local businesses, trading, and cash cropping.",Business,Anticipation,"James Marape, Solan Mirisim",The National

Peter ToRot to be canonised next month,https://www.thenational.com.pg/peter-torot-to-be-canonised-next-month/,23/09/2025,"THE Catholic Church is expected to canonise Blessed Peter ToRot next month, making him Papua New Guinea’s first saint. According to a recent edition of the Vatican News, Fr Tomas Ravaioli, IVE, an Argentine missionary and the vice postulator of the canonisation of Peter ToRot, serving in PNG for 15 years, said the people of PNG were “very excited”. “It all happened so fast it feels like a gift, the last present of Pope Francis to our beloved country,” he said. Pope Francis visited PNG in September 2024 and expressed his desire to canonize Peter ToRot. In March 2025, he signed the decree, paving the way for the October ceremony in Rome. “This canonisation is not only new but also historic,” Ravaioli explained. “Papua New Guinea has never had a canonised saint. “Next month, we will have our first.” Peter ToRot was born in 1912, the son of a village chief. He was a husband and father of three children, a humble catechist, living an ordinary life deeply rooted in faith. Trained as a catechist, he assumed pastoral responsibilities when missionaries were imprisoned during World War II. Despite Japanese restrictions on Christian practices, he secretly organised catechism classes, prepared couples for marriage, taught children, visited the sick, and distributed Holy Communion across villages, often walking for five to six hours to reach them. He offered himself for the service of the church, and in 1945, he was arrested and martyred for opposing polygamy, following an order executed by the Japanese authorities that wanted to reintroduce the practice. His defense of Christian marriage and morality cost him his life at just 33 years old. “ToRot was like John the Baptist,” Ravioli said. “He openly told people that it was not lawful to take multiple wives. For this, he was imprisoned and eventually killed. He defended the sanctity of marriage and died for the truth.”",Religion,Joy,Nill,The National

Uguro, the son of the late Usino-Bundi MP Jimmy Uguro, through lawyer Tony Waisi, filed the election petition in the National Court in Waigani on Sept 12. The petition is challenging the 278 votes which Kumura won by – 14,649 votes to 14,416. Included in the petition are allegations of “significant errors and omissions” by polling officials in villages in wards six, seven and eight of the Usino local level government. The petition claims that the presiding officer failed to use the official ward roll to verify the voters’ identities. Instead of calling names from the roll, officials allegedly instructed voters to form two separate lines, one for men and one for women, and distributed around 3,600 ballot papers without proper checks. Uguro argued that it allowed for a voting process that violated constitutional and electoral requirements. The number of ballots allegedly cast without proper verification of 3,600 was larger than the final vote margin. Uguro’s petition does not seek a new by-election but instead asks the court to order a recount of all votes while excluding the two ballot boxes from the wards where the alleged irregularities occurred. The Usino-Bundi by-election writ was issued on April 24. It was conducted under the Limited Preferential Voting (LPV) system where a voter picked three candidates in the order of first, second and third.

Narawec said the station, when Garaina Valley Tea was still in production in the late ‘80s, was the home of Garaina Tea and during its production, many people from around the country lived and worked there. A pilot track has been cut through the Garaina Valley and has reached the station but Narawec said more work was still needed to make the road accessible by vehicles. Wau Waria district development is now setting its roadwork machines on this Northern Highway which will link Wau, Biaru, Waria, Garaina Valley and on to some parts of Sohe district in Northern. Narawec estimated that by the end of this year or early next year, the road reaching Garaina Station should be ready. For many villages in the valley, establishment of a road network has been their dream for the past 50 years. Many have died while waiting for this vital service to reach them until Wau Waria DDA, under the chairmanship of MP Narawec, decided to give priority to the road link. Speaking to people in the valley at Garaina Station, Narawec told them to take ownership and help the district Works division to ensure the track is upgraded well. “When this road link is completed, it will make way for other services to reach you people,” he told them. “This Garaina Station will then be revived and we are also looking at reviving the Garaina Tea Plantation as well.” Narawec urged community leaders, youths and the people in Garaina Valley to look after public servants serving at the station as well as schools and health posts. “Look after these public servants as they sacrifice their lives, their families, time and resources to come here and serve you people in the Waria local level government,” he said. Narawec also urged the public servants in the LLG to serve the people diligently and work in partnership to revive Garaina Station to what it was like in the past. He added that the DDA will give its best to build a police station and other government facilities once better roads reaching the station are upgraded.",Development,Anticipation,Marsh Narawec,The National
Researcher calls for PNG-Bougainville pact,https://www.thenational.com.pg/researcher-calls-for-png-bougainville-pact/,23/09/2025,"THE Papua New Guinea and Bougainville governments should consider framing both governments’ relationship into the future as a new item in the Joint Supervisory Body agenda, according to a researcher. Lowy Institute senior researcher Oliver Nobetau, in his September edition, titled Bougainville’s future, drew a roadmap for development proposes actionable reforms to be undertaken by both governments for socio-economic development. “A separate agreement should be drawn up to provide certainty on development,” he said. “The Bougainville Peace Agreement’s ambiguity on the post-referendum process extends to what the PNG and Bougainville relationship will look like following the ratification vote in Parliament.” Nobetau said despite the Melanesian agreement where both governments committed to maintaining a close, peaceful and enduring relationship, the new agreement should focus on a partnership that states how PNG can also benefit in Bougainville’s development. The recommendations laid out include: “The idea to create a special purposes authority is not new as in 2006, Bougainville’s House of Representatives passed legislation for the creation of a Bougainville Restoration and Development Authority (BRDA), repealed in 2012,” Nobetau said. “Similarly, in 2021 a review of the National Coordination Office of Bougainville Affairs recommended the establishment of an authority responsible for the management and delivery of projects agreed by both governments. “Ideally, such an undertaking should be made prior to the PNG parliament’s vote on ratification of the Bougainville referendum and the 2027 independence deadline set by Bougainville leaders. “The timing for this proposal is also fitting with Bougainville and PNG at political and generational crossroads. “With PNG celebrating its 50th anniversary, and half of Bougainville’s population born post-conflict, the scene is set for a revitalisation and rebranding of the relationship.” Nobetau said with the political and parliamentary deadlines of 2027 fast approaching, proposed reforms should be undertaken by both governments sooner.",Politics,Anticipation,Nill,The National
Sulka tribe celebrates World Indigenous Day,https://www.thenational.com.pg/sulka-tribe-celebrates-world-indigenous-day/,23/09/2025,"THE Sulkas, an indigenous tribe in Kokopo’s Bitapaka local level government (LLG) area in East New Britain, celebrated the World Indigenous Day with tribes from other parts of the world on Sept 11. The four wards in Bitapaka LLG belong to the Sulka tribe. They are Ganai, Mope, Watwat and Vunabaur. People from the wards gathered at Ganai to commemorate the day. Ward member for Ganai, Augustine Alois, said they celebrated Sept 11 as an affiliate to the World Indigenous Convention Organisation. Alois said this was the second time they had celebrated the World Indigenous Day. The first was last year and they planned to celebrate every year from here on. He said World Indigenous had given them certain requirements and once they meet all of them, they will be certified as an indigenous tribe in ENB. Alois said the requirements include: Alois said the Sulka tribe existed more than 300 years. He said white men came into contact with them in the 1500s and they have records of all this information. “In this province we have different ethnic groups and we the Sulka tribe are one of those marginalised ethnic groups,” he said. “The ENB provincial government has been suppressing some of our rights. “Our land rights, our development and services. “These lack of services and development are obvious when you travel down. “You can see that the good part of the road ends where the Tolais are, the electricity ends where they are, the water supply ends where they are and the good communication network ends where they are. “So, if we have existed for this long, what makes us different from the rest of ENB? “We deserve a fair treatment as well, fair distribution of developments and services. “We contributed so much to the economy of this province as well as into the nation’s purse, because most of the coconut and cocoa plantations were established by the white men on Sulka tribe’s land. “But in return, we get nothing.

Woman freed from murder charge,https://www.thenational.com.pg/woman-freed-from-murder-charge/,23/09/2025,"THE National Court in Minj has freed a woman who was charged with the murder of her husband three years ago, upholding her no case to answer application. National Court Judge Joseph Crowley when handing down his decision in the case of Janet Kund Malu, from North Waghi’s Kuspa village in Jiwaka, said the State produced no evidence on elements necessary to provide a charge of murder. “Therefore, I uphold the application of the defence and declare Malu has no case to answer and she is discharged in relation to indictment 2127 of 2023,” he said. The court heard that on June 17, 2022, between 8am and 9am, Malu and her husband, Gilma Kolngo were allegedly fighting inside their house. During the fight, she allegedly used a tree branch to hit her husband. The State further alleged that she struck him on the right side of his neck which resulted in his death. However, when the trial started, the prosecutor informed the court that three of the four prosecution witnesses were not in court and police were unable to locate them. The prosecutor said the family of the accused had paid compensation to the family and as such the witnesses (who were from the same village) were reluctant to give evidence. On the first day, only one witness gave evidence and on the second day, only one other could be located and brought to court.

Warding off spirits. Bridge opened with ritual,https://www.thenational.com.pg/warding-off-spirits-bridge-opened-with-ritual/,23/09/2025,"A PIG’s head was cut off and thrown into the Tolo river in East New Britain’s Pomio in a traditional gesture to ward off the spirits of the river as a 204-meter bridge was unveiled on Sept 17. The new Tolo Bridge connects villages in Pomio’s Mamusi-Yana local level government (LLG) area to Palmalmal government station, and locals with access to services from Pomio’s main commercial hub. The bridge is the result of a collaborative effort between Gilford Limited and the Pomio administration. Construction was carried out by Gilford’s subsidiary company, Vision Engineering and Construction Limited. After six months of work, the bridge is now complete and is expected to last longer than the two previous bridges that were washed away by the Tolo River. General Manager of Gilford Limited, Mok-Chow Kheng, said the teamwork had created something durable that would improve the lives of the people. “The bridge will make travel and business easier, especially during the rainy season, when theriver was once a big problem,” he said. Pomio MP Elias Kapavore, speaking at the opening, praised the company for the timely completion of the bridge. Kapavore said the opening of the bridge also marked the beginning of the country’s 50th year of independence. “Today is the first day of our 50th year as an independent nation,” he said. “This bridge took only six months to complete. “It was constructed on time and within budget.” Kapavore urged the people to make good use of the bridge and other services available to them. “We have two ships,” he said. “It was my responsibility to buy the ships, and it is now your responsibility to fill them with cocoa, copra, and coffee. “I challenge you today, you have roads now. Make sure you work the land and get your cash crops to the market.” Kapavore also highlighted the importance of respecting cultural traditions.

PNG has special significance for New Zealand army colonel George Duncan,https://www.thenational.com.pg/png-has-special-significance-for-new-zealand-army-colonel-george-duncan/,23/09/2025,"PAPUA New Guinea holds a special place in the heart of New Zealand army Col Duncan George, who recently oversaw a successful PNG Defence Force (PNGDF) celebration of the country’s 50th anniversary of independence. George was born in Christchurch and attended Riccarton High School, but for three years from the age of eight, he lived in PNG, learning the language and experiencing the nation’s rich culture. His father, Squadron Leader (Rtd) Chris George was posted as one of the New Zealand Defence Force instructors to the local defence academy and the family lived in Igam Barracks in Lae. In February, George was appointed the Joint Task Force Commander to plan and support the week-long anniversary celebrations. This included a military tattoo attended by military bands from Australia, Fiji, France, India, Japan, New Zealand, Tonga, United Kingdom, United States and Vanuatu. There was also a fleet review of Navy vessels, an air shows over Ela Beach and a static display of visiting and PNG aircraft. “I’m relieved that it went well, but also very proud of PNG, the PNG Defence Force and of course, the New Zealand and Australian Defence Forces that helped out,” George said. The week also provided opportunities for visiting aircraft from Australia, France and New Zealand to deliver supplies such as medical equipment, books and mosquito netting, to remote areas around the country. “There were a whole bunch of countries that came over to help celebrate, which was fantastic and it was great the majority of them were from around the Pacific region,” George said. George has been embedded in the PNGDF since December 2023 as the Deputy Chief of Staff, so has a unique insight into why this celebration was so significant for the country. “PNG is the most populous nation in Oceania. From a strategic geographic point of view, it straddles Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It’s a leading nation within the Pacific Islands Forum in terms of its size, geography and natural resources,” he said. “It was important to reflect on the positive aspects of the country, because all too often governance, the economy and law and order were the focal point from international observers. “PNG is a proud nation with uninterrupted parliamentary democracy, a growing middle class, and it’s a nation that has a big voice in the Pacific.” George’s family ties to the area remain to this day. His father was known for his professional skills but also his ability to train, mentor and encourage young Papua New Guinean aviators. Last month, George’s father Chris was presented with a commendation by PNGDF deputy chief Brig-Gen Lari Opa. “The great memories I have of being in PNG during the 80s were so strong that I always wanted to come back, I just wasn’t sure when or how. Having three kids (two teenagers) meant that I was a little hesitant to do it so late in my career, but my wife told me that it was now or never, so we took the plunge,” he said. George is the sixth deputy chief of staff to come from the NZDF since the appointment was created in 2009. “PNG and the PNGDF can be challenging places to live and work, but the people are the key to being here. They have different ways of doing things, but I’m lucky in the sense that I grew up here for a while, I’ve retained much of my Tok Pisin (Pidgin) and I feel comfortable and accepted here as one of the Defence Force’s own. “My wife has taken to scuba diving and my children are having a great experience at their respective schools,” he said. George, who finishes his posting in December, said he saw PNG as becoming increasingly important for New Zealand in the coming years. “I encourage anyone who is passionate about the Pacific and our place in it to consider a posting here. You need an adventurous spirit, but serving here will be a highlight in anyone’s career.”",Business,Trust,Nill,The National
Deputy secretary of state Landau commends US-PNG partnership,https://www.thenational.com.pg/deputy-secretary-of-state-landau-commends-us-png-partnership/,23/09/2025,"THE United States (US) has congratulated Papua New Guinea on its 50th Independence anniversary, marking five decades of partnership and shared progress. Deputy secretary of state Christopher Landau and Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, visited Port Moresby to commemorate this historic milestone, reaffirming the continuous relationship between the two countries. During the visit, Landau emphasised the US’ commitment to strengthening economic ties, enhancing infrastructure development, and deepening defence cooperation with PNG. Prime Minister James Marape and Landau signed a framework for strategic cooperation, formalising mutual priorities for the future of the bilateral relationship. The framework encompasses economic, commercial and digital collaboration, as well as critical minerals and infrastructure development. At the same time, the framework reaffirms existing mechanisms, like the Strategic Partnership Dialogue and the 2023 Defence Cooperation Agreement. “US engagement in the Pacific is broad,” Deputy Secretary Landau said. “From unexploded ordnance remediation programmes in PNG, to recent capacity building, infrastructure, and security programmes across the region,” he added. The visit also included key events such as the groundbreaking of DGCI’s US$498 million (about K2.08 billion) US-funded fuel storage facility, facilitated through the 2023 Defence Cooperation Agreement. These initiatives underscore the US’s commitment to supporting PNG’s economic growth, resilience, and regional security. USINDOPACOM’s Centre for Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance (CFE-DM) has updated its disaster management handbook to mark 50 years of US-PNG relations on Sept 16. The handbook builds local crisis response capacity, fosters civil-military relationships, provides a vital tool for US-PNG cooperation during a crisis, strengthens the resilience of PNG, and supports US’s shared vision for a secure and open Indo-Pacific. The US Department of State is using US$11 million (about K46 million) in foreign military financing to enhance PNG’s capabilities in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and military professionalisation is underway.

‘Capable operator’ flew drones at Copenhagen Airport,https://www.thenational.com.pg/capable-operator-flew-drones-at-copenhagen-airport/,23/09/2025,"Copenhagen: Drones that shut the Denmark’s main airport appear to have been flown by “a capable operator”, police say, adding that no suspects have been identified. The airports in Copenhagen and Oslo, the two busiest in the Nordic region, were shut for hours after drones were observed in their airspace late on Monday, leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded as flights were diverted. “We have concluded that this was what we would call a capable operator,” Danish police Chief Superintendent Jens Jespersen told reporters on Tuesday, referring to the drones observed in Copenhagen. “It’s an actor who has the capabilities, the will and the tools to show off in this way,” Jespersen said, adding it was too early to say if the incidents in Denmark and Norway were linked. Copenhagen Airport was closed for four hours when two or three large drones were seen flying in its immediate vicinity, officials said, while the Oslo Airport was closed for three hours following two sightings, according to local police. Jespersen said the drones in Denmark came from several different directions, turning their lights on and off, before eventually disappearing after several hours. Copenhagen diverted 31 flights to other airports, causing ripple effects that delayed or cancelled around 100 flights and affected some 20,000 passengers, a spokesperson told reporters on Tuesday. The airport shutdowns came after a string of disruptions at European airports in recent days. A cyberattack last Friday knocked out check-in and boarding systems supplied by Collins Aerospace, a unit of RTX, affecting operations at London’s Heathrow and the Berlin and Brussels airports.

Trump targets antifa as a ‘terrorist organisation’,https://www.thenational.com.pg/trump-targets-antifa-as-a-terrorist-organisation/,23/09/2025,"Washington: US President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling the antifa movement a “terrorist organisation”, the White House says, after promising actions targeting left-wing groups following Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Kirk, a prominent conservative activist with close ties to Trump, was assassinated on Sept 10 while speaking on a college campus in Utah. A 22-year-old technical college student has been charged with Kirk’s murder. Investigators are still looking for a motive and have not said the suspect operated in concert with any groups. But the Trump administration has used the killing as a pretext to revive years-old plans to target left-wing groups they regard as being hostile to conservative views. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a “decentralised, leaderless movement composed of loose collections of groups, networks and individuals”, according to the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks extremists. “While some extreme actors who claim to be affiliated with antifa do engage in violence or vandalism at rallies and events, this is not the norm,” it says on its website. Trump’s 370-word executive order on Monday directs “all relevant executive departments and agencies” to “investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations” conducted by antifa or anyone who funds such actions, according to the White House. “Individuals associated with and acting on behalf of Antifa further co-ordinate with other organisations and entities for the purpose of spreading, fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful political speech.” Federal law enforcement officials already investigate violent and organised crime associated with a variety of hate groups and ideological movements. The US government does not officially designate solely domestic groups as terrorist organisations in large part because of constitutional protections. But a Justice Department official with knowledge of discussions on the issue said Trump’s order would unlock expansive investigative and surveillance authorities and powers. The person, who declined to be named, said the designation would allow the US government to more closely track the finances and movements of US citizens and to investigate any foreign ties of the loose network of groups and non-profits the Trump administration views as antifa. It was not clear which individuals would be the target of such a probe. Critics of the administration have warned it might pursue an attack on free speech and opponents of the Republican president. Political violence experts and US law enforcement officials have previously identified far-right attacks as the leading source of domestic violent extremism. Trump administration officials have sought to portray left-wing groups as the main drivers of political violence in their remarks since Kirk’s death. Legal experts have said the domestic terrorism designation might be legally and constitutionally dubious, hard to execute and raise free-speech concerns, given that subscription to an ideology is not generally considered criminal under US law. During the first Trump administration there were at least two failed efforts to designate antifa a terrorist organisation. Source: Reuters",Politics,Fear,Nill,The National
ICC charges Duterte with crimes against humanity,https://www.thenational.com.pg/icc-charges-duterte-with-crimes-against-humanity/,23/09/2025,"The Hague: Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has been charged with crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The 80-year-old is accused of being criminally responsible for dozens of murders that allegedly took place as part of his so-called war on drugs, during which thousands of small-time drug dealers, users and others were killed without trial. Duterte is the first Asian former head of state to be indicted by the ICC. ICC deputy prosecutor Mame Mandiaye Niang said Duterte was an “indirect co-perpetrator” in the killings, which the court alleges were carried out by others, including police. A redacted version of the ICC’s charge sheet was only made public on Tuesday. The first count against Duterte relates to his alleged indirect co-perpetration in the murders of 19 people between 2013 and 2016 when he was mayor of Davao City. It was in this southern stronghold, which Duterte ruled for decades, that he tested his war on drugs, which he later implemented nationwide during his presidency from 2016 to 2022. “During the mayoral period, Duterte, [redacted] and the above-mentioned law enforcement officials used police from Davao City and non-police hitmen (together, the DDS) to kill alleged criminals,” the document said, without revealing the names of the former president’s accomplices. It added the former president headed the so-called Davao Death Squad (DDS). The other two counts relate to the murders of 57 people. Fourteen of them were classified by the ICC as “high-value targets,” some of whom appeared on a list that offered financial incentives to police officers. These 57 murders took place from the beginning of Duterte’s presidency in 2016 until 2019, when he withdrew the Philippines from the Rome Statute that governs the ICC, fearing prosecution. “Duterte and his co-perpetrators shared a common plan or agreement to ‘neutralise’ alleged criminals in the Philippines (including those perceived or alleged to be associated with drug use, sale or production) through violent crimes including murder,” the document said. The ICC ordered Duterte’s arrest in March, accusing him of murder as a crime against humanity in the context of his war on drugs which, during his term, killed some 6000 people, police say. NGOs put the figure at around 30,000. He surrendered to the ICC on March 12 in response to the arrest warrant, and appeared before the judges in The Hague for the first time two days later. Duterte’s supporters allege the ICC is being used as a political tool by the Philippines’ current president Ferdinand Marcos, who had publicly fallen out with the powerful Duterte family. The ICC effectively has no power to arrest people without the co-operation of the countries they are in, which is most often refused – and Marcos had previously dismissed the idea of co-operating with the ICC.

Palestine statehood a ‘point of contention’ in US ties,https://www.thenational.com.pg/palestine-statehood-a-point-of-contention-in-us-ties/,23/09/2025,"Sydney: Australia has been urged not to ignore threats of “punitive measures” from top Republicans, as the prime minister lands in the US for one of his most important diplomatic ventures. Anthony Albanese arrived in New York City on Sunday morning Australian time ahead of a long-awaited United Nations General Assembly meeting where Australia, Canada, France and the UK will recognise the state of Palestine. But hours before touchdown, a group of top Republican congress members and allies of Donald Trump issued an open letter to the leaders of those nations warning recognition “may invite punitive measures”. “This is something that very well could be a point of contention between the Albanese government and the Trump administration,” United States Studies Centre director Jared Mondschein told AAP. “It should not be ignored.” But that doesn’t mean Australia cannot stand its ground. The UK’s foreign policy – like Australia’s – has begun to diverge from the US after decades of generally moving in lock step with the world power. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has been able to work through his differences with the US president. “I would not be surprised if Prime Minister Albanese and President Trump are able to overcome their differences of opinion on this matter too,” Mondschein said. Albanese is hoping to secure his first face-to-face meeting with Trump, though talks have not yet been scheduled. Some speculated the two could hold discussions on the weekend before the UN event, but this was dispelled when the president announced he would attend the funeral of right-wing American commentator Charlie Kirk on Sunday in Arizona. The prime minister was due to meet with the US president in June during the G7 summit, but was left wanting when Trump departed the event early to intervene in escalating Middle East violence. In the months since, a bilateral meeting has arguably become a lesser priority for Albanese. The US in August spared Australian goods from a tariff hike, leaving its products at the baseline 10 per cent – which is the lowest rate levied against any American trading partner. But there is still much to discuss that extends beyond the bilateral US-Australia relationship, like the security environment and strategic competition in the Pacific. “If Australia and the United States – who are the closest of allies – are able to get aligned on this, then that will give momentum to other allies in the region,” Mondschein said. Stepping onto the tarmac at John F Kennedy International Airport in New York, Albanese emphasised the importance of Australia’s role on the world stage. “What we want to see is increased peace and security and stability around the world,” he told reporters. “We are a country that play a positive role in our region, in the Pacific, as well as of course … our traditional allies such as our Five-Eyes partners including the United States and the United Kingdom.” Source: AAP",Politics,Anticipation,Nill,The National
Vanuatu flags China policing deal after Australia snub,https://www.thenational.com.pg/vanuatu-flags-china-policing-deal-after-australia-snub/,23/09/2025,"Canberra: Australia’s attempt to net a security pact with Vanuatu has hit a major snag as one of the Pacific nation’s ministers flags expanded policing co-operation with China. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his Vanuatu counterpart Jotham Napat were scheduled to sign a transformational security deal ahead of Pacific leaders meeting in the Solomon Islands this month. The AU$500 million (about K1.4b) deal – the second attempt by Albanese to formalise an agreement with Port Vila – fell over at the last minute after Vanuatu raised concerns it could inhibit assistance from third nations. Napat said there were issues around it potentially blocking other nations being able to fund the nation’s critical infrastructure projects. Australia has been working to sign exclusivity agreements across the Pacific to lock China out of critical infrastructure and security, and has struck similar deals with Tuvalu, Nauru and Papua New Guinea. But Vanuatu has effectively been playing Australia and China off against each other to bolster its own aid. China donated policing equipment including drones to Vanuatu after Chinese State Councillor and Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong met with Internal Affairs Minister Andrew Solomon Napuat. The Vanuatu Daily Post reported Napuat said Vanuatu had already finalised memorandums of understanding and co-operation agreements with other nations like Australia, and China was the only nation with which it still needed to formalise a pact. “Our two governments wish to formalise a police MoU similar to existing MoUs with Australia, New Zealand, France, the UK, and PNG, to better co-ordinate and manage different areas of partnership in the policing sector with all of our partners,” he is quoted as saying. He said the agreement was not the same as the Nakamal security agreement being negotiated with Australia. The Nakamal agreement is the pact under which Australia seeks to bolster Vanuatu’s economic and developmental needs in exchange for security co-operation. While the text hasn’t been made public, similar agreements Australia has struck include an effective veto of third nations providing assistance for security or critical infrastructure. Napuat said international media had exaggerated and misrepresented discussions about its security partnerships “which have very specific meanings in Vanuatu’s context”. Vanuatu’s interest wasn’t in militarisation but on security issues such as climate change, crime and general policing, he said. “This is why we must define our own security challenges and determine our security and policing needs,” he said. “Climate change is the biggest security threat in Vanuatu.” Prior to this month’s stalled deal, Australia and Vanuatu agreed a security agreement in 2022 that expressed a “family first approach to peace and security in our region”. The rhetoric is used by the Australian government to denote that security needs should be met by Pacific nations and not outside countries, namely China which is working to secure its only foothold in the region. The 2022 pact – Albanese’s first attempt at deal-making after coming to office – was never ratified by Vanuatu’s parliament due to concerns it breached the nation’s non-alignment foreign policy and had greater implications for its sovereignty.

France joins Western allies in recognising Palestine,https://www.thenational.com.pg/france-joins-western-allies-in-recognising-palestine/,23/09/2025,"UNITED NATIONS: France has recognised a Palestinian state at a world summit in New York, nearly two years into the war in Gaza, joining Western allies such as Britain and Australia, which already made the same historic move and were rebuked by Israel. “We must pave the way for peace,” the summit host, French President Emmanuel Macron, said on Monday. “Today, France, recognises the state of Palestine.” While the event, convened by France and Saudi Arabia, could boost the morale of Palestinians in their long search for statehood, it is not expected to deliver change on the ground. The most far-right government in Israel’s history has declared there will be no Palestinian state as it pushes on with its fight against militant group Hamas in Gaza following the Oct 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed some 1200 people. Israel has become increasingly isolated and drawn global condemnation over its military conduct in Gaza, where more than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to local health authorities. In recent weeks, Israel has begun a long-threatened ground assault on Gaza City with few prospects for a ceasefire. Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg and San Marino were also expected to recognise a Palestinian state on Monday ahead of this week’s UN General Assembly, after Canada, Portugal and others did so at the weekend. Malta made the announcement earlier on Monday. Israel has said such moves will undermine the prospects of a peaceful ending to the conflict in Gaza. The two-state solution was the bedrock of the US-backed peace process ushered in by the 1993 Oslo Accords. The process suffered heavy pushback from both sides and has all but died. No such negotiations over a two-state solution have been held since 2014. The United States and Israel boycotted Monday’s meeting. Israel’s UN Ambassador Danny Danon said Israel would discuss what action to take in response to the announcements of recognition after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returns to Israel next week. “Those issues were supposed to be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians in the future,” he told reporters ahead of the meeting. The United States has told other countries that Palestinian recognition will create more problems, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier this month. Amid Israel’s intensified Gaza offensive and escalating violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, there is a growing sense of urgency among some nations to act now before the idea of a two-state solution vanishes forever. France has driven the move, hoping that Macron’s announcement in July that he would recognise a Palestinian state would give greater momentum to a movement hitherto dominated by smaller nations that are generally more critical of Israel. A delegation representing the State of Palestine has observer status at the United Nations – but no voting rights. No matter how many countries recognise Palestinian independence, full UN membership would require approval by the Security Council, where the US has a veto.

Canberra has teamed up with the Pacific countries in a proposal to jointly hold the 2026 United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP31. Turkey has also expressed an interest in hosting the summit and neither bidder has so far backed away from the chance to hold the talks on home soil. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is preparing to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York to try to convince the leader to withdraw Ankara’s bid. Albanese said he would advocate for Australia’s case in good faith, and he had already held discussions with Turkey’s leaders. “It’s a joint bid and there’ll be a range of Pacific leaders here this week who will be advocating as well,” he told reporters on Monday. “If we’re going to see our way through to a common position, it is highly likely there will be a need to be compromise.” The prime minister will be hoping to emerge from the UN with a diplomatic victory on the world stage after failing to land formal deals with Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea in his last two overseas trips. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said Australia “shouldn’t be cowering and letting Turkey win this battle”. “Adelaide should be the host city and we should get on with showing leadership around the world,” she said. “If the prime minister doesn’t bring COP home … that’ll be a fail.” The conference will be held in the German city of Bonn under COP rules if an agreement can’t be reached between the two bidders. The impasse must be solved before the latest climate conference, in Brazil, concludes in November. The negotiations follow the federal government’s announcement of its 2035 emissions reduction target on Thursday. Greenhouse gas emissions would need to be reduced by between 62 and 70 per cent from 2005 levels to reach the goal. Source: AAP",Politics,Anticipation,Nill,The National
Race to save Solomons’ history as radio reigns supreme,https://www.thenational.com.pg/race-to-save-solomons-history-as-radio-reigns-supreme/,23/09/2025,"Honiara: The historical soundtrack of one of Australia’s near-neighbours is at risk of being forever lost. In a small room lined with shelves brimming with chronicles and recordings at the rear of the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation in Honiara, sits Salei Rukasi. She has been working there since 1984. The veteran archivist is painstakingly undertaking the digitisation of thousands of hours of audio tapes to ensure the Pacific nation’s unique legacy lives on as time begins to ravage some of the material. The process, as it applies to the most extensive audio archive in the Solomons, began in the early 2000s in a tiny studio and with a single reel-to-reel machine. However the equipment is now faulty and the tapes are being sent to Australia to be converted as part of the Pacific Media Assistance Scheme managed by the ABC and supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Solomon Islanders still rely heavily on radio given the remoteness of some of its communities, which are scattered across an archipelago of almost a thousand volcanic islands and low-lying coral atolls to Queensland’s northeast. “It is very important because that’s the only audio you can have of them,” Rukasi recently told AAP in Honiara about the families that routinely visit her studio in search of recordings documenting the lives of their loved ones. “Maybe they’re published in books and all that but to hear somebody’s voice … actually, I think that is very important. “It can be maybe be traditional chants or things like that,” she explained. The archives include recordings, interviews and speeches from the Solomons’ long fight for independence granted in 1978. Periods of national upheaval which followed and other major political moments, as well as cultural events and local music from the station’s old recording studio, also feature. Relatives, children and even grandchildren have come searching for links to their forebears, Rukasi said. The Solomon Islands has been through tribulation and turbulence aplenty since gaining self government in 1976. Ethnic conflict between 1998 and 2003 tore apart the nation and collapsed its economy. However a regional peacekeeping force spearheaded by Australia arrived in 2003 to help restore peace and order. For better or worse, the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation has been there through all of it following its creation by one of the nation’s first acts of parliament upon severing administrative ties with Britain. It now proudly broadcasts across more than 28,000 square kilometres, reaching the archipelago’s far flung corners. Video may have killed the radio star but hasn’t yet caught up with Rukasi.

Pacific snags could follow Albanese to Trump meeting,https://www.thenational.com.pg/pacific-snags-could-follow-albanese-to-trump-meeting/,23/09/2025,"Darwin: Anthony Albanese is being accused of prioritising “photo ops” over diplomacy after his failure to seal two major deals with Pacific nations risked derailing an upcoming meeting with Donald Trump. Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said the prime minister had misrepresented the status of defence agreements with Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu by saying they were done deals before returning home empty-handed. Albanese left Port Moresby on Wednesday without a hoped-for defence pact with PNG after its prime minister, James Marape, failed to convene his cabinet to sign off on the landmark agreement in time. Instead, the leaders only managed to put their signatures to a communique laying out the key tenets of the pact, which Marape insists will be approved by cabinet shortly. “With every piece of diplomacy, agreement making, you just have to do the work. And clearly that hasn’t been done because he announced that it was all achieved and when he got there it clearly wasn’t,” Ley told Nine’s Today programme. Albanese insists the delay in signing the defence treaty has “no downside”, brushing aside claims it’s an embarrassment for the government. But the delay comes just more than a week after Albanese also returned empty-handed from a visit to Vanuatu, failing to land an AU$500 million (about 1.4b) deal that would have given Australia veto power over Chinese investment in critical infrastructure. “For the prime minister to rush over there and to use this just as a photo op, I think tells us that he isn’t doing the work, and it’s a real foreign policy failure, not just with PNG but with the $500 million deal with Vanuatu,” Ley said. The timing is unfortunate, given Albanese is preparing to visit the United States this week for an expected first face-to-face meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. The Albanese government risks being seen as having dropped the ball in Australia’s role as the US’s deputy sheriff in the Pacific. The Trump administration has been leaning on Australia to boost its security presence as a bulwark against Chinese influence in the region. The US expected Australia to maintain a strong security presence in the Pacific and the failure of its PNG and Vanuatu deals meant missed potential, Lowy Institute research fellow Oliver Nobetau told AAP. “This could have demonstrated that Australia and Papua New Guinea – it sees itself as a big brother – can maintain regional stability within the Pacific,” he said. The stalled agreements were probably going to reinforce US perceptions that Australia could do more when it came to security in the Pacific, Nobetau said. The government needed to go back to the drawing board to find a different diplomatic approach to instil confidence, especially among Melanesian nations, to sign on to such agreements, Nobetau said.

New Zealand loosens path to residency for some migrants,https://www.thenational.com.pg/new-zealand-loosens-path-to-residency-for-some-migrants/,23/09/2025,"Wellington: The New Zealand government says it is introducing two new pathways for migrants to gain residency as part of their efforts to boost the country’s economy. Economic Growth Minister Nicola Willis said in the statement that skilled and experienced migrants play an important role in plugging workforce gaps, and in turn help businesses to grow. “Businesses told us it was too hard for some migrants to gain residence, even when they had crucial skills and significant experience that was not available in the existing workforce. We’re fixing it,” she said. The new pathways are for skilled workers and tradespeople and technicians, and require them to have relevant experience both overseas and in New Zealand and to meet salary thresholds, the statement said. New Zealand’s economy has been struggling having seen negative growth in three of the last five quarters and the government has been introducing a number of policies aimed at supporting it, including boosting foreign investment. While the Pacific nation’s net migration has remained positive, it has come off the highs seen following the reopening of the borders in 2022 as a historically high number of New Zealanders leave. Government coalition partner New Zealand First said it does not support the policy. Source: Reuters",Business,Anticipation,Nill,The National
Tongan royal visit a return to familiar territory,https://www.thenational.com.pg/tongan-royal-visit-a-return-to-familiar-territory/,23/09/2025,"Canberra: While not quite a homecoming, Tongan royalty has returned to familiar territory on a visit to Australia’s bush capital. King Tupou VI and Queen Nanasipau’u have been welcomed by Governor-General Sam Mostyn and the Federation Guard with a smoking ceremony at Government House in Canberra on Friday. The royals are also due to visit Sydney as part of their week-long trip – the first official visit by a Tongan head of state to Australia in 46 years. The king’s welcome to Government House included a signing ceremony between Australia and Tonga for a statement of intent to lift the countries’ bilateral relationship. The statement committed to lifting the partnership with an agreement known as Kaume’a Ofi, which means close friends. Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the visit would strengthen bonds between Australia and Tonga. “Their majesties’ visit to Australia demonstrates the importance of our bilateral relationship and depth of the cultural and personal connections between our two countries spanning 200 years,” she said in a statement. “The visit will celebrate our strong defence ties, scientific innovation in heath and rich connections across faith.” The ceremonial visit is not the first time Tonga’s head of state has been in Canberra on official business. King Tupou VI became Tonga’s first high commissioner to Australia in 2008 and lived in Canberra for four years before ascending to the throne upon the death of his elder brother, King Tupou V. The king’s daughter, Princess Angelika Latufuipeka Tuku’aho, then held the role until 2023, when she stood down to complete doctoral studies at the Australian National University’s Department of Pacific Affairs. The Tongan royals will take part in an investiture ceremony in Sydney for Tongans living in Australia who assisted in the aftermath of the 2022 Hunga Ha’apai volcano disaster. It will be followed by a church service on Sunday, with members of the Tongan diaspora invited to attend. The Pacific nation will celebrate 150 years as a constitutional monarchy in November.

Power outage in Port Moresby due to substation fire: PPL,https://www.thenational.com.pg/power-outage-in-port-moresby-due-to-substation-fire-ppl/,22/09/2025,"PARTS of Port Moresby experienced power outages over the weekend following a fire at the Konedobu substation on Friday night. A PNG Power Limited statement said that the fire severely damaged the 12-year-old 11kv control panel and burnt out insulation on several feeder cables. The affected areas included Down Town, parts of Korobosea, Hohola and Waigani. The statement said: “The damaged equipment requires a replacement that must be sourced from overseas. “In the interim, our engineers are executing a careful strategy to transfer your power supply to other operational substations. “This is a complex and dangerous process. We must balance the electrical load precisely to avoid overloading other feeders and causing further outages.” PPL urged consumers in the affected Kone feeders to be patient. “Our teams are handling high-voltage equipment and managing loads to ensure the safety of our personnel and the integrity of the entire grid. Rushing this process could risk further extended outages,” it said. Meanwhile parts of Port Moresby were without water on Saturday.

O’Neill cautions government about meddling with state agencies,https://www.thenational.com.pg/oneill-cautions-government-about-meddling-with-state-agencies/,22/09/2025,"IALIBU-Pangia MP and former prime minister Peter O’Neill has warned the Government to stop interfering with important public institutions. In a Facebook post, O’Neill claimed that the recent interference in public institutions by the James Marape-led Government was a deliberate attempt to access public funds without the transparency and accountability needed. “The lack of transparency and accountability promotes corruption and allows politicians with dirty fingers to access billions of Kina. “This is eroding public trust,” he said. O’Neill claimed that the Government seems to be moving its focus from public accounts in Treasury and Finance to State-owned entities and public institutions such as the Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited and the National Banking Corporation. “Where is the respect for the constitutions of public institutions to protect them from political interference?” O’Neill said. He said that it was clear (Prime Minister Marape) had no commercial acumen or business experience to manage these important public institutions. “As a result, over the last six years, we have gone from one Marape-made mistake to another followed by more false promises,” he added. “Marape is calling for public officials to be tested by the courts but he and many in his government refuse to submit themselves to the same process. “We cannot blame the citizens for smelling a rat.” In response yesterday, Marape described O’Neill’s sentiments as “misleading, hypocritical, and unworthy of someone who presided over the worst era of economic mismanagement” in the nation’s history. “It baffles me that Mr O’Neill can talk about transparency and accountability when his own record speaks volumes of the opposite,” Marape said. “As an accountant and self-styled economic manager, he should recall the disastrous state in which he left this country when his government collapsed in 2019.”",Politics,Anger,James Marape,The National

Sonk is a highly respected professional, known locally and internationally and any actions such as roadblocks, kidnappings, destruction or harassment in his name will only tarnish his reputation. “He has not been terminated, but merely suspended to respond to allegations – a normal process that any managing director, chief executive officer or department head may go through.”",Politics,Trust,James Marape,The National

China issues statement on security agreement,https://www.thenational.com.pg/china-issues-statement-on-security-agreement/,22/09/2025,"PAPUA New Guinea is tangled up over a security agreement with its closest neighbour Australia as China warned that the agreement should not restrict third parties and undermine the sovereignty of PNG. The Chinese Embassy in Port Moresby said that the Joint Communiqué between Papua New Guinea and Australia on a Mutual Defence Treaty should not be exclusive in nature, nor should it restrict or prevent a sovereign country from cooperating with a third party for any reason. It said that the Chinese side adheres to the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs, and respect PNG’s right to conclude a bilateral treaty with other countries on a voluntary basis. However, such a treaty should also refrain from targeting any third party or undermining its legitimate rights and interests. China is hoping that the government would continue to uphold independence and self-reliance, properly handle issues bearing on its sovereignty and long-term interests, and work with China to maintain the sound development of China-PNG relations and mutually beneficial cooperation. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Wednesday said that the treaty was seen as strengthening Canberra’s push to curb China’s influence in the region. “Pacific Island countries (PICs), including Papua New Guinea, face top challenges of tackling climate change and accelerating development. China welcomes closer cooperation between PICs and other countries,” he said. “We actively help PICs grow the economy and deliver better lives for their people. “That being said, we believe that cooperation between PICs and any country should put the independence and development of PICs first, uphold openness and inclusiveness, and not target any third party.”",Politics,Fear,Nill,The National

Kalinoe said given the vast land and sea areas, security of PNG’s borders and threats against illegal cross-border activities and cybersecurity as well as the potential of domestic and international terrorism need to be stepped up. He warned, however, that the Government needs to ensure that the purpose and intent of the proposed Defence Treaty is clearly defined and is aligned to PNG’s foreign policy. Further, Papua New Guinea’s national interests and international obligations must be given priority, consideration and context. Kalinoe said the Government recently completed a review of PNG’s foreign policy and the status of the document is not yet known. “Currently, however, the basic thrust of the PNG Foreign Policy is based on the general principle of friends to all and enemy to none which was adopted at independence in 1975,” he said. “This policy thrust was later harmonised to Selective Engagement.” He said if the Pukpuk Defence Treaty is based on the current foreign policy of selective engagement then the proposed treaty is consistent with this policy. “However, given the potential impact the treaty will have on PNG’s national interests and international obligations, it should follow a thorough domestic review and consultative process, including for consistency and compliance with the national Constitution and Parliamentary procedures.”",Security,Trust,Nill,The National

Caution over importation of explosives,https://www.thenational.com.pg/caution-over-importation-of-explosives/,22/09/2025,"POLICE commissioner David Manning has issued a caution to any person or business seeking to import fireworks, flares and other explosive items without required legal clearance. Manning said police, working with the Papua New Guinea Customs Service, has received numerous applications for the import and movement of explosive items that could potentially be misused if not properly controlled and safeguarded. “If not professionally transported, stored and managed, fireworks pose a risk to public safety, and in the wrong hands can be used to kill people or attack property,” Manning said in a statement. “The number of applications to import fireworks, flares and other explosive devices has increased substantially over the past year. “Police will not rubberstamp applications for civilian explosives that can easily end up in tribal conflicts and criminal activities. “There are also issues of overall public safety in the way that these explosives are safely transported and stored so as to reduce risk to public safety and potential theft. “We cannot run the risk of explosives being transported improperly through public spaces, or stored in where they could incidentally be set off or stolen.” Manning has provided standardised policy guidance for applicants seeking endorsement to import pyrotechnics (fireworks). “To enhance public safety and ensure pyrotechnics are imported for appropriate purposes only, and are properly handled, a heightened level of due diligence is in effect. “To ensure efficient consideration, applicants are advised to have the right documentation submitted for consideration,” Manning said. “There must be a fully completed import application form submitted before the explosives arrive in the country. “We must have copies of necessary licences and permits issued in accordance with the Explosives Act. “Information must be provided with details as to whether pyrotechnics are intended for a specific event or programme, and details of that event. “Further, there must be evidence of training for the applicant or their staff in the safe handling and use of pyrotechnics, and suitable insurance arrangements in place. “The provision of complete documentation will assist in the assessment of applications. “Upon receipt of completed request information, applications will be reviewed for endorsement by the RPNGC and PNG Customs. “The bottom line is that fireworks are explosive devices, and should only be managed by properly trained individuals in the interests of public safety.”",Security,Fear,Nill,The National
Police get assets funded through special infrastructure initiatives,https://www.thenational.com.pg/police-get-assets-funded-through-special-infrastructure-initiatives/,22/09/2025,"DEPUTY police commissioner (special operations) Donald Yamasombi yesterday received keys to two houses and an armoury from Arepesh Construction for the Dog Unit at Bomana. Yamasombi said for the houses it was a token of appreciation from the contractor who has worked alongside the force. “Over the years and in many projects that we have in the organisation, we don’t have people who come forward with such token of appreciation. “It’s something that will stay with us for years to come,” Yamasombi said. He said the constabulary had a programme called the Special Police Assistance programme (Spap) which caters for funding for police infrastructure. The two houses were renovated at a cost of K150,000 by the contractor. The fencing and armoury were funded under the Spap. He said so far they have rolled out some programmes at the outside centres to rehabilitate infrastructure for the police force. “For the National Capital District in 2023, the police headquarters gave funding for the fencing to secure the barracks, but out of their own pockets, the contractor changed the design of the fencing and did a better one. “It’s costly and it’s secure. With the fencing comes the armoury. “We have the firearms and ammunition we carry around but we don’t secure them properly.” Yamasombi said the dog unit is privileged to have such assets which also includes three new vehicles that were recently presented to them. “Look after these assets, they don’t come easy,” he said. “Receive the things with a good heart and take good care of them.”",Business,Trust,Nill,The National
Patient safety is everyone’s business: WHO,https://www.thenational.com.pg/patient-safety-is-everyones-business-who/,22/09/2025,"PATIENT safety is the business of everyone in the health practice and should begin at birth and continue every step of the way, an official says. World Health Organisation (WHO) PNG acting representative Dr Josaia Tiko said this during the Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH) Independence celebrations in conjunction with World Patient Safety Day in Port Moresby on Friday. “Children are some of the most vulnerable patients in any health system as their small bodies developing immune systems and complete dependency on adults, mean that any small mistake in care can have devastating consequences as you observe from day to day,” he said. “We also know that social factors such as poverty, lack of education or living in remote areas can increase the risks children face in getting safe and timely care.” Tiko said unfortunately adverse events still happen far too often in patient care. He said these events include diagnostic errors, medication mistakes, delays in treatment and breakdown in communication between providers and families. “Therefore, WHO calls on all of us, governments, policy makers, health care workers, facility managers, parents and teachers to take action in terms of patient care,” he said. Tiko added that the same attention and resources must also be given to those children and adults living with disabilities. He stressed that these challenges must be addressed if everyone is serious about achieving equitable and safe healthcare for all and also healthy nation. Deputy chairman of the PMGH board Katherine Johnson, the PMGH staff that   commemorated the country’s 50th independence anniversary, they must also raise the standard in health in the hospital. “Our nation is only as strong as the health of its people, and patient safety is not just a medical concern, it is a national imperative,” she added. Johnson acknowledged all the staff and management of PMGH and their work and make patients’ safety a culture and part of their daily decision. She also challenged them to speak up for safety, encourage patients to ask questions, share concerns and be active partner on in their care.",Health,Trust,Nill,The National

"Understand constitution, public told",https://www.thenational.com.pg/understand-constitution-public-told/,22/09/2025,"PAPUA New Guineans have been reminded to turn to the Constitution to address much of the development challenges that have been affecting the country. Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) secretary Dr Mange Matui said the Constitution needed to be better understood as it was the compass for all law-making, governance and national development. “The challenges ahead for the country are immense, from globalisation, climate change, digital transformation, overpopulation and cultural changes, we all have to face these collectively as one people,” he said. “Our Independence in 1975 was not merely a political event; it was a profound act of faith. “It was a declaration that the people of Papua New Guinea had the wisdom, courage, and capacity to govern ourselves. “These values were so noble, pure and timeless that, they were what guided the creation of the Constitution and they permeated throughout the Constitution. “Today, the Constitution guides government bodies, including the CLRC, to implement their activities in alignment with the requirements of the National Goals and Directive Principles, serving as a moral and policy compass for law-making, governance, and national development,” Matui said. He made these remarks during the CLRC’s gala dinner to commemorate the country’s 50th Independence Anniversary in Port Moresby on Monday. A picture book of the commission, highlighting its achievements since its establishment in 2004, was also launched. Matui said the CLRC played an integral part in nation-building, adding that their work was similar to that of doctors saving the lives of people. “When a medical doctor begins with a patient, the first thing he or she does is feel the pulse,” he said. “From that simple act, they can tell whether the body is healthy or in need of care. “In the same way, the CLRC performs that critical role of finding the pulse of our society. “Where the law is weak, outdated or unresponsive, we prescribe treatment through reforms that restore relevance, fairness, and justice. “We will continue to feel the pulse of our society, diagnosing its needs, and prescribing reforms that keep our democracy healthy.”",Governance,Trust,Nill,The National

This is just a due process and if he rises above this and proves his innocence by suing the media organisation that revealed impropriety against him, then I am sure the board will consider his innocence, but he must take the responsibility to prove his innocence. “The integrity of the company is bigger than any individual, including myself and I can understand why the board took this position. “It is now incumbent upon him to clear his name and respond to these allegations. He said the board was appointed to look at the company, and the managing director has been in the company for a long time, so he has nothing to fear if he is totally innocent. “This process will help him clear his name once and for all as a professional son of the country,” Marape said. Marape reiterated his confidence in the independence of the board and the rule of law. “The board has done its job, and now it is up to the suspended managing director to do his part by clearing these allegations. “My government will always respect the rule of law and the independence of boards to carry out their functions. “We will never compromise governance for politics.

Papua New Guinea Banks and Financial Institutions Workers Union president Killie Sapu-Keari described the Government’s move as an attack on the integrity of PNG’s financial sector and a betrayal of the reforms instituted by the late Sir Mekere Morauta. “(They were) reforms that strengthened the economy, protected workers’ superannuation funds, and shielded the nation’s wealth from political exploitation,” she said. “This reckless move will have far-reaching consequences, with a direct impact on dividends for Nasfund shareholders, plus thousands of ordinary Papua New Guinean workers who rely on these funds for their retirement security. “The Government appears to have no appreciation of the economic and social fallout of its decision. “Rather than building financial stability, private sector growth, and employment creation, this action undermines investor confidence and jeopardises the health of PNG’s financial ecosystem.” Sapu-Keari said that BSP, through its rural banking network and community-based agents, had already taken steps to reach the unbanked population. “The claim that this decision will solve issues of financial inclusion and high fees is a dangerous pretence. “Instead of empowering SMEs – the backbone of job creation – government policies have imposed excessive IPA fees, uncompetitive tax regimes, and burdensome compliance costs that actively discourage entrepreneurship. “The very manufacturers and businesses employing Papua New Guineans are also being squeezed, threatening jobs and economic growth.” Sapu-Keari said investor confidence had already been shaken when PNG faced the possibility of being grey-listed due to its lack of effective and technical compliance with international Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) standards. “If the Government is serious about financial reform, it must strengthen the policing framework for existing AML/CTF policies and begin holding people to account. “Policies that look good on paper but lack enforcement will not protect the nation.

It was a celebration of our people, our achievements and our future. “We showcased the talent, culture and enterprise of our communities while inspiring the next generation to contribute to the district’s growth.” The two-day show, which was hosted on Sept 16-17, featured cultural dances, agricultural displays, exhibitions and sporting activities. It also promoted small businesses, tourism, and the district’s campaign to declare Bulolo town a national heritage site. One of the highlights came on day two when the Royal Engineering Battalion from Igam Barracks staged a dramatic mock battle. The soldiers demonstrated tactical skills, discipline and teamwork in a simulated battlefield scenario that thrilled the crowd while also educating them on the vital role of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force in maintaining security.

Tomuriesa raises concerns over Australia-PNG defence treaty,https://www.thenational.com.pg/tomuriesa-raises-concerns-over-australia-png-defence-treaty/,19/09/2025,"OPPOSITION Leader Douglas Tomuriesa raised concerns about sovereignty, constitutionality, indemnities, law and order, and how a defence treaty between PNG and Australia agreement will be governed in practice. Tomuriesa, in a statement on Wednesday, said: “Any arrangement that allows foreign forces to operate on PNG soil, recruit our citizens, or integrate closely with our Defence Force has potential sovereignty implications. “Sovereignty is not just symbolic: it concerns who exercises legal authority, who is accountable when things go wrong, and whether PNG’s right to make independent decisions is preserved.” Tomuriesa said these questions must be addressed transparently and in line with PNG’s Constitution and the oversight roles of Parliament and the judiciary. “Recent coverage indicates the agreement will deepen integration and offers pathways for PNG nationals to serve in the Australian Defence Force – which makes these sovereignty questions urgent,” he said. Tomuriesa also said treaties that affect defence and domestic security raised constitutional issues. “For legitimacy and public confidence, the treaty should be tabled in Parliament, debated publicly, and if necessary referred to the Supreme Court for any constitutional questions,” he said. “We should also require clear implementing legislation so responsibilities and limits are spelled out in PNG law, not left solely to executive agreements.” Treaties sometimes create special status provisions for foreign soldiers, Tomuriesa added. “If personnel are given immunity from local prosecution, victims can be denied justice – as happened in other countries’ disputes over visiting forces arrangements,” he said. “The treaty must not create blanket immunities that undermine PNG’s criminal jurisdiction. “Examples show that immunity or unclear status arrangements can become major political flashpoints. “PNG needs strong partnerships, but not at the cost of our constitutional authority, legal protections for our citizens, or independent decision-making. “I would welcome cooperation that strengthens our Defence Force, but only with binding safeguards.”",Politics,Fear,Douglas Tomuriesa,The National
Police post burning mars celebrations,https://www.thenational.com.pg/police-post-burning-mars-celebrations/,19/09/2025,"CELEBRATIONS of the 50th independence anniversary in Kainantu, Eastern Highlands were marred by the burning of a police post and looting of two shops. Eastern Highlands provincial police commander Chief Supt John Kale said members of the public went on a rampage and burnt the police post near the Kainantu – Aiyura junction and broke into and looted two Asian shops on Wednesday. He said some opportunists who had differences with police attacked the police post amid public frustration over the funding of the staging the anniversary celebrations in Kainantu. “The Kainantu District Development Authority was accused by the public for not supporting them to stage independence celebrations and went on a rampage, causing destruction to the police post and looting of the shops,” Supt Kale said. He appealed to leaders in Kainantu to surrender suspects of the rampage. Kale said any public funding from the Government must be used to help people celebrate and enjoy the special anniversary. “I condemned the actions of the public and urged those with political interests to put aside their differences. “If you want to contest in the election, the 2027 election is around the corner, wait instead of using such situations to disturb peace and harmony,” Kale said. “Apart from these incidents, other districts had peaceful celebrations including the Goroka Show event that coincided with the independence anniversary.” Meanwhile, Kainantu MP William Hagauno said the peaceful independence anniversary celebrations in Kainantu were disturbed by drunk members of the public. “The 50th anniversary celebrations in Kainantu districts were done in village communities where the people are found most of the time, it went smoothly and ended peacefully,” he said. Hagauno said the people enjoyed the celebrations hosted by district organising committee using the money the Government allocated. “The organising committee shared the money equally to every corner of the district, they hosted peaceful celebrations like every district in PNG. “It was around 4.30pm when I came back from Ayanontu Primary School in Bilimoia area of Agarabi local level government when a fight broke out in Kainantu,” he said. Hagahauno said he waited at Three Mile near Kainantu until tensions eased before he came into town. He was assisted by the police. He said police could not do much because they were outnumbered, the rampage in town triggered at the music concert by drunken men that led to the burning of the police post and the break-in and looting of the Asian shops. He said there were two separate celebrations hosted in Kainantu town, the main programme at the Peace Park was peaceful until someone with political interest hosted a music show that attracted drunken public to caused nuisance. Hagauno named the person behind the musical concert and blamed him for being responsible for causing the mayhem. “I earlier told the police to stop the man from hosting the concert but they failed,” Hagauno said. “The violence was caused by drunken men, drug addicts and people with political intentions to disrupt the celebrations and paint a bad image of me,” he said.",Politics,Anger,Nill,The National

He said the treaty promised interoperability, shared logistics, and even recruitment pathways for PNG citizens into the ADF. While this might modernise PNG’s defence capabilities, he said it also risked: He said if Australia wanted to “lure” PNG’s cabinet into signing, it might offer: “But unless PNG’s legal framework is updated and public trust is earned, this treaty could remain stalled—or worse, signed under pressure and later unravel led,” he said.",Politics,Fear,Nill,The National

Australia and PNG sign defence communique,https://www.thenational.com.pg/australia-and-png-sign-defence-communique/,18/09/2025,"PAPUA New Guinea and Australia have agreed on the text of a Mutual Defence Treaty, which will be signed following cabinet processes in both countries. The joint communique of the Mutual Defence Treaty also known as the Pukpuk Treaty is intended to elevate defence relationship between the two countries to an alliance. Prime Minister James Marape and his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese in a joint press conference yesterday said the treaty will include a mutual defence alliance which recognised that an armed attack on Australia or PNG would be a danger to the peace and security of both countries: According to Australian Associated Press, the deal may not be as snappy as Albanese hopes because of a holdup in gaining PNG cabinet approval for the pact. Marape said the communique signed was to establish core principles of the treaty after proper process are done by both cabinets as this is a military and not a dictatorship. “Australia has a big area of huge ocean and air space and PNG is part of the land mass in those spaces, it is in our interest to have a defence focus that is mutual for two nations,” he said. “50 years on the prime minister or commander cannot defend the over 4,000sqkm of land the ocean space we have in this security is priority. This is foresight that not just secures Australia but PNG. It was upon PNG’s proposal.” Albanese added that the treaty will elevate the status to an alliance. It will be Australia’s first new alliance in more than 70 years. “The treaty will build on 50 years of cooperation between the two countries, including the defence cooperation,” he said. “Our new alliance will reflect our true commitment to each other and to a region that is peaceful, stable and prosperous. “ He said the alliance will be grounded in 50 years of cooperation as equal partners. It will build on our unique security relationship, the foundation of which is the kinship between generations of our defence personnel. “It will recognise the sacrifices our peoples have made for each other and the cause of peace and our nations’ enduring commitment to the principles of democracy and sovereignty.”",Security,Trust,James Marape,The National

Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Prime Minister James Marape signed the framework yesterday, a day after the country’s 50th Independence anniversary. The framework underscores “mutual priorities for the next 50 years of the US – PNG bilateral relationship” according to the US Embassy. US ambassador Ann Marie Yastishock said the signing of this framework reflected the enduring partnership between the two nations and highlights the wide range of sectors for collaboration. “The US has stood with PNG since day one, in 1975,” said US Ambassador Yastishock. “This framework builds on five decades of cooperation based on shared values and a shared vision of the future,” she added. Meanwhile, the US had also acknowledged its private sector investment in the extractives sector. According to the US Embassy, the framework highlighted cooperation in critical minerals extraction and processing, with a focus on sustainable development, investment competitiveness, and practices to benefit the local communities in which companies operate. Furthermore, the embassy said that existing US companies could contribute to PNG’s overall development, as the framework states both nations will work together to increase US investment in PNG, and collaborate on policies aimed to attract greater US investment, including an increased focus on the use of trusted technology and strengthened cyber-security practices. Part of the focus of the framework is to allow for research and exploration into deep sea or seabed minerals. The US is supporting advancement of deep sea science that can be used to inform seabed mineral development and responsible mining activities in the Pacific to secure access to reliable supplies of critical minerals for strategic industries, which will benefit the US industry and the region. The document reaffirmed US’s commitments, including the 2023 Defence Cooperation and Ship-rider Agreements, the reoccurring Strategic Partnership Dialogue which was first held in Washington, DC, in 2024, and existing defence, maritime security and law enforcement capacity building and training programmes. Landau said: “This Framework for Strategic Cooperation reflects the United States’ commitment to a comprehensive partnership with PNG.” “It not only strengthens our defence ties but also fosters economic growth, innovation, and shared prosperity.”",Business,Trust,James Marape,The National

PNG has not done enough: Bureaucrat,https://www.thenational.com.pg/png-has-not-done-enough-bureaucrat/,18/09/2025,"PAPUA New Guinea has not done enough in the past 50 years in its commitments to trade compliance and market access, a senior bureaucrat has said. Joshua Kalinoe, former chief secretary, department head and diplomat, told a gala dinner hosted by the Commerce and Industry Department on Sept 15 that while the country had done well in providing a strong democracy and institutions that continued to protect justice, prosperity and progress, much needed to be done on the trade front to grow the economy. He also considered as “alarming” certain imbalances between economic stimulus and consumption financing. Kalinoe, who once served as commerce and industry department secretary observed that ever since independence, PNG had signed only three free trade agreements. Kalinoe said: “Since the PNG LNG project over 10 years ago, no foreign direct investment (FDI) or a trade agreement were signed with international partners. “This is a disappointing performance. Cross-border export trade and FDI are important to stimulate and facilitate sustainable domestic economic growth.” The veteran bureaucrat said both developing and developed nations were today pursuing aggressive cross-border export trade and FDI strategies. Countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia were spending more time, money and human capital in trade and investment. Kalinoe urged PNG to adopt similar aggressive strategies and to begin by complying with the rules-based multilateral trading agreement (Bali Agreement) which imposes significant commitments for compliance and implementation. PNG also needed to coordinate implementation at political and bureaucratic levels which remain obstacles today,” he said. “Therefore, there is a pressing desire now for a realignment and harmonisation of some of our implementation mechanisms. “Such reforms should be performance and result based,” he said. On economic stimulus and consumption financing, Kalinoe said PNG had been borrowing heavily in the last five years from international financial institutions to fund its consumption budget. He said: “No economic stimulus intervention frameworks have been announced or formulated by the government. “Nothing wrong with borrowing so long as the funds are applied to value adding economic and social projects. “However, consumption borrowing to support the goods and services budget is a problem. “The debt will have be paid back by taxpayers at the expense of declining provisions for health and education services. “Further, the debt burden in the future will be paid by the coming young generations and instead of improving their standards of living, they will remain poorer. “So instead of borrowing more, the country should introduce strategic economic stimulus frameworks to facilitate domestic economic growth.  Such an approach should be based on a string of sectoral programmes and coordinated by a relevant agency of Government. “The epicenters of such a strategy should be to support existing businesses to expand as well as to facilitate increased FDI and cross-border export trade.”",Business,Sadness,Nill,The National

"Certain provisions of constitution needs changing, says Kwa",https://www.thenational.com.pg/certain-provisions-of-constitution-needs-changing-says-kwa/,18/09/2025,"JUSTICE and Attorney-General Department Secretary Dr Eric Kwa says certain provisions of the Constitution need to change with the times to allow for more development in the country. Kwa said the Constitution, including other relevant laws, needed to be subject to change through proper vetting processes. He said at least 50 amendments have been made to the Constitution since it was first adopted on Aug 15, 1975, by the Constituent Assembly and effective on Sept 16 the same year, coinciding with Independence Day. “The amendments are bound to happen,” he said. “When we look at the founding fathers and the constitution planning committee, they were developing the Constitution from an age of colonial oppression. “What was envisioned then and what we are experiencing now are very different. “Therefore, we must expect changes. “Changes are necessary to remain relevant but we must keep the foundation of the Constitution intact “Changes are necessary and there will be more in the future to sustain us as and ensure that we continue to exist a sovereign nation. “Beyond certain amendments, all the others were just to fix the edges of some of the provisions.” Kwa said constitutional amendments in 1995 which introduced the Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Government was one example of the Constitution being changed during a time when the then-leaders saw fit to do so. “However, that was one of the biggest mistakes made,” he said. “Over the years, we have seen the demise of rural service delivery being sucked back to Waigani.” Kwa added that he supported the need for reforms to me made to allow for more decentralisation of powers and functions back to the provinces. Meanwhile, Kwa said all citizens needed to appreciate the freedom granted by the Constitution since 1975. “We may not have all the roads, bridges and all the other services but we are still free in our own country,” he said. “This is a reason to celebrate. “We must honour this freedom. “Even after 50 years, we are still one country.”",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National

Education secretary Dr Uke Kombra sounded this reminder last Thursday as the Department of Education begun its two-day pre-independence celebration at Butuka Academy in Port Moresby. The celebrations ended on Friday. Thursday’s event began with flag raising witnessed by Education Minister Lucas Dekena, Higher Education Minister Kinoka Feo, Education secretary Dr Uke Kombra and education staff from both the Education Department and the Higher Education Department. Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP) 2023-2027 was also launched on the same day. Kombra reminded the teachers and department officials that as they celebrated the nation’s 50th independence day, they must remember that the country’s freedom was built on the foundation of an educated and empowered population. “The future of our community is in our hands, and it begins with our commitment to education and so let us celebrate our shared history and be inspired to create an even better future for our nation,” he urged. “For the past 50 years, the Ministry of Education has been the cornerstone of our nation’s journey since getting independence in 1975. “We were tasked with a difficult challenge and that was to unite the nation of 1,000 tribes and cultures and languages through the universal language of learning. “We built schools in remote villages and on distant islands, trained generations of local teachers and throughout the curriculum that honour our traditions and prepare our youth for a modern world.” Kombra said despite the many challenges they faced, this anniversary was a testament to the hard work and the tireless dedication of the countless teachers, administrative staff, and those who had side-shaped the lives of generations, nurtured minds that had gone on to lead government, industries, societies and communities. He highlighted that ESDP was a collaborative effort of five key agencies and aimed to provide an overarching view of our country’s development plan for education. “This is the first time ever since 1975 that we have witnessed a plan that unites the whole education sector,” he said. Kombra said the main goal of the ESDP was to implement the investment programme outlined in the Medium Term Development Plan Four (MTDP4). “The ESDP’s investment programme are linked to the key deliberate interventions programme from MTDP 4, including early childhood education, basic quality primary and secondary education, tertiary education, technical and vocation education training.”",Education,Trust,Lucas Dekena,The National

The two-day event, held at the college grounds in Kenabot, is celebrated under the theme “celebrating our silver journey and golden freedom, empowering minds and inspiring growth in education”. Events coordinator Janet Magaga said the occasion reflected the college’s long history and contribution to education in Papua New Guinea. “It’s a double celebration. It has been 25 years of existence here and of service to Papua New Guinea,” she said. KBC traces its roots to 1960 when it was established in Tavui as a secretarial college offering training for Grade 8 students. In 1975, it was moved to Rabaul but was later closed due to volcanic activity. It reopened in 1985 before being transferred to Kokopo Business College in 2000 through support from Australian Aid and the Gazelle Restoration Programme. Magaga said day one of the programme featured cultural performances, traditional food, stalls from students, alumni, SMEs, and corporate houses, as well as speeches, cake cutting, and a song competition. Day two continued with more regional and provincial performances, fun games, sales of merchandise and a fashion show to crown Mr and Miss 25th Silver Jubilee. KBC student representative council vice-president Janelle Sialis highlighted the role of student discipline and leadership in making the celebration possible. “So early in March, we the SRC decided to keep the students occupied when we have term breaks, we have mini games so that they feel involved and they avoid going out drinking or making nuisance,” she said. Sialis added that because of the students’ good behaviour and cooperation, the principal had approved the college’s graduation to be held at the end of this year rather than the following year. “I think the event is just turning out great. Everyone’s enjoying themselves,” she said. Meanwhile, Magaga has reminded KBC of its vital role in shaping future leaders. “I think KBC has contributed to nation building by educating a lot of students from all across Papua New Guinea,” she said. She added that graduates must use their skills to create opportunities. She said if they did not find employment, they should create employment from the skills that they had learned from the school. Magaga encouraged young people to be proactive. She said the school wanted to see young people doing something good for themselves. “They can create employment opportunities instead of waiting for a job offer,” she said. Magaga also explained why fundraising was part of the celebration and that was to raise funds to help the school with a lot of things that needed support. “That’s why we have put a registration fee for small table markets and SME stalls for K200, corporate stores for K250,” she said.",Education,Joy,Nill,The National

’50 years doesn’t happen twice’: Marape urges citizens to unite as country celebrates 50 years,https://www.thenational.com.pg/50-years-doesnt-happen-twice-marape-urges-citizens-to-unite-as-country-celebrates-50-years/,15/09/2025,"IN the eve of the country’s 50th Independence anniversary, Prime Minister James Marape is calling on all Papua New Guineans to stand united to see the country’s flag being hosted up for the 50th time. “I want to say to the children of Papua New Guinea, the generation that is alive today, 50 years of our nationhood, don’t happen twice,” he said. “The 50 years of a nationhood happens only once, and we are privileged to be the generation that is witnessing our nation pass through 50 years. “Never forget children of this country. There was once upon a time, certain parts of this country mostly were labeled ‘No to dogs and natives’.” He said it was against this backdrop that the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare’s generation all gravitate towards the idea that PNG can be a nation now. “We can be administrators of our own, we can run country on our own, and they moved mountains to achieve independence much faster than many would have envisioned or thought.” Marape told people to lay aside their differences in tribal, political differences, or any other issues they have in society and turn their attention towards the national flag, national anthem, and pledge tomorrow.",Politics,Trust,"James Marape, Michael Somare",The National
From back blocks to top job: Marape’s story,https://www.thenational.com.pg/from-back-blocks-to-top-job-marapes-story/,15/09/2025,"IT is a crisp September morning in Port Moresby. The streets are adorned with red, black and gold flags as Papua New Guinea counts down the hours to celebrate its 50th year of independence. From his office, the Parliament House and a monument of the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare are visible. Prime Minister James Marape watches the new Courthouse complex which his Government had allocated K401 million to complete. Marape is in his office, busy even on a Sunday, but he has made time for a chat. His story is of a young boy growing up in one of the remotest parts of the country, far from Port Moresby or the trappings of high office. That boy was born in 1971 in the rugged interior of Hela before moving to rural Western province. His journey from remote villages to the nation’s highest political office mirrors the story of PNG itself – resilience, hope and the belief that tomorrow can be better than today. Marape was only four years old when his missionary parents were stationed at Nomad in Western. The country was just weeks into independence in September 1975, but for families like the Marapes, daily realities had changed little. Remote areas with no roads and health facilities. Barefoot walking long distances to school, and often wearing traditional clothes were Marape’s lifestyle. Tragedy came early. His parents lost their first-born child to malaria, a wound that never fully healed and which gave young James a first-hand understanding of the fragility of life in rural PNG. “All my life I was educated in some of the remotest schools – from Western to West Sepik to Enga and the Eastern Highlands,” he recalls. “At 12, I became a boarding student at Paglum in remote Western Highlands, and that was when I first met students from all over PNG.” The Marape household revolved around hard work. His mother tilled the land, baked scones, and sewed clothes which James sold. “My mother was my first employer,” he said with a laugh. “I sold her products every school holiday. Whatever I earned went towards my school fees. Children today won’t understand the hardship we faced then.” Politics entered his life early. Campaign houses were part of community life in the Highlands, and by age 11, Marape was sitting cross-legged on the ground, listening to speeches and debates at the Anganmul village in Minj. “Seeing my mother’s struggle, I told myself that one day I would be a Member of Parliament,” he said. It was not bravado but a child’s vow born of hardship and observation. Like many young men of that era, he briefly considered a tradesman’s path – the promise of wages and tools was tempting. His parents refused. They saw in him the capacity to go further and insisted that he finished school. “Seeing their commitment, I buried myself in books,” Marape recalls. After Grade 10, he won a place in Grades 11 and 12 at a reduced fee of K80 – a blessing that made higher education possible. In 1990, the University of Papua New Guinea accepted him into its programme. For his tribe in Tari, it was a milestone worth celebrating. Education was still a rarity. “Attending UPNG made me the contemporary PNG man I am today. It opened my eyes to the whole country.” It was at the Waigani campus in 1991 that his ambition sharpened. Student debates, policy papers, the clash of ideas – all cemented his conviction that politics could be a vehicle for change. Marape first stood for election in 2002 for the Tari Open seat, finishing second. He returned to Port Moresby and worked as a principal research officer at the Department of Personnel Management, gaining a close-up view of how the machinery of government functioned. Yet the pull of politics did not fade. In 2007, Marape resigned from the public service to contest again. This time the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare travelled to Tari to campaign for him. It was more than political endorsement; it was a beginning of a mentorship that would shape Marape’s approach to leadership. “My loyalty lies with Sir Michael,” Marape said. He won and in 2008, Somare appointed him Minister for Education. Marape joined the Peter O’Neill Government in 2012 and rose through the ranks, serving in various ministerial posts. But in April 2019, he broke away over differences in policy and governance, a decision that set off a chain of events leading to his election as Prime Minister in May, 2019. During the tense days at the Laguna camp, when MPs huddled in hotels and alliances shifted hourly, Sir Michael paid him a visit. Marape still smiles at the memory. “He was glad when I announced my membership of Pangu Pati. Little did I know Pangu would be in power and leadership until now.” With leadership came heavy responsibilities. “What saddens me most is having to bury four former Prime Ministers while at the helm – Sir Mekere in 2020, Sir Michael Somare in 2021, Sir Rabbie Namaliu in 2023 and Sir Julius Chan in 2025. “As a child of the 70s, I had the hardest task of burying all the heavyweights.” He still remembers Sir Michael’s last words about his Karau village in the Murik Lakes, Angoram, 11 days before he passed on in 2021. Such moments remind him that the nation’s founding leaders governed with ethics and service at the forefront. “At this 50th anniversary, those of us here now must ask ourselves, what we can give or do for this great nation.” As the anniversary celebrations draws near, Marape’s speech carries both pride and urgency. “Much work remains to be done in health, education, law and order, and growing the economy. I cannot do it alone. We have not achieved all. Let’s work together. Our customs, Bible and Constitution are our guides. Leadership starts at home.” For Marape, that last point is more than a slogan. His upbringing taught him that leadership begins with discipline and care for family. It is a message he repeats to young Papua New Guineans who crowd around him at events. From the barefoot boy selling scone on dusty Highlands roads, to the man steering a complex and youthful nation, James Marape’s story is inseparable from Papua New Guinea’s own. Both are still work in progress, still grappling with distance and diversity, still seeking unity and development. As the national anthem swells at lead-up events and flags flutter, Marape turns to wave at the crowd. Somewhere in the stands, a young boy from a remote village might be watching, dreaming his own improbable dream.",Politics,Trust,"James Marape, Julius Chan, Michael Somare, Sir Julius Chan",The National
Former CJ on leadership: Constant changes have brought instability,https://www.thenational.com.pg/former-cj-on-leadership-constant-changes-have-brought-instability/,15/09/2025,"FORMER chief justice Sir Arnold Amet has highlighted the constant change in national leadership as an impediment to the country’s development. Sir Arnold said Papua New Guinea has seen the election of 10 prime ministers since 1975, adding that political instability has ensued when prime ministers were removed by a vote of no confidence (VoNC) or resignation due to the threat of one. He said that Section 145 of the Constitution, which governs the process for a VoNC, has caused much of the political instability faced by the country’s leadership at the national level. “In 50 years, we have elected 10 prime ministers following the first national general election in 1977, with seven changes of prime ministers between the elections,” he said. “We have had 10 elections, 10 prime ministers, and in between the elections, an additional seven changes of prime ministership. “Altogether, we have had 17 prime ministers during the 50 years of independence which averages out to 2.9 years of active service per prime minister. “So the critical challenges these facts raise is the apparent and considerable political instability in government as a result of far too many frequent VoNCs under Section 145 of the Constitution or threats of VoNCs resulting in resignations. “With less than three years of a national leadership turnover and changes of executive leadership, is that the formula for the development of a nation? “This leads to inconsistencies in the implementation of policies, including constant changes in priorities.” He added that too many political parties were also to blame for the instability seen in governments over the years. “There are too many political parties with at least 22 in Parliament right now of the 56 registered. “This is not a formula for consistent government and leadership.” Sir Arnold said that the country needed good governance and not more politicisation of government and leadership. He urged all Papua New Guineans to learn and understand the meaning of five National Goals and Directive Principles outlined in the Constitution. They are: “These wordings are critical and are not just mere rhetoric,” he said. “We must bring back the National Goals and Directive Principles into the conversation for practical application, policy formulation and decision-making.”",Politics,Sadness,Nill,The National
"Three generations, one journey",https://www.thenational.com.pg/three-generations-one-journey/,15/09/2025,"ON Sept 16, 1975, my mother, with thousands of Papua New Guineans, not in Port Moresby, heard of the raising of our new flag for the first time. She was pregnant with me then — just four months from bringing me out into a country that, like me, was still waiting to take its first tentative steps. She and my late father were in Lorengau, Manus, that day. There was music and tears, dancing and speeches, but above all there was a sense of hope – hope for a fresh start, hope for unity, and hope for a better life for the next generation. I was one of that next generation, not yet born, but already belonging to the story of an independent Papua New Guinea. I was born in January, 1976. My life commenced in the first chapter of PNG’s life as a Sovereign State. In some ways, my course has resembled hers, one of dreams, tribulations, lessons learned and growth. Coming of age in a new nation, I was raised as a child in a nation in the process of finding itself. The early days of independence were hopeful and fraught. We were an eclectic people that learned to walk together, considering development of the modern as well as the ancient traditions with us. I remember the slow, simple days, pre-smartphone, pre-instant communication, when I was getting letters written by hand, listening to the transistor, walking the dusty roads. But I also remember the strength of families, the strength of community and the determination to be part of something better. PNG was young, and so was I. Eventually, I found my path in the media industry — a career that has now spanned 26 years. It has been one of the great privileges of my life to tell the story of this country, to give voice to its challenges, its accomplishments and its people. In the course of my career, I have seen history being made. I’ve seen governments come and go, policies fought and protested, roads constructed, protests and celebrations held. I’ve encountered everyday Papua New Guineans involved in extraordinary acts during their daily lives, and I’ve witnessed the indomitable spirit that pushes us along, even when progress seems slow. But I’ve also witnessed the difficulties – corruption, inequality and missed opportunities. Along with many Papua New Guineans, I have asked why such a richly blessed nation with resources and talent has not yet realized its full potential. But even in the midst of these frustrations, I am hopeful — because I have seen what we can do when we are united. In parallel with PNG’s 50th independence, I’ve been doing some personal reflection about my own pending milestone. I’m 49 years old and have almost experienced every second of this nation’s story — growing, changing, learning and discovering her strength right beside her. And now, I look at my 20-year-old daughter, who will reach that milestone in December — a mere three months after our nation hits half a century. Her life embodies the future my mother hoped for on that Independence Day in 1975. I hold the same hopes for my daughter today — that she may grow up in a country where her dreams can come true, that opportunities are broader, that her generation can lead with courage, wisdom and compassion. Turning 50 is more than a number — for me and for Papua New Guinea. It’s a time to step back, take stock and decide what sort of future we want to build. What I’m hoping is simple: That the dreams of 1975, the dreams my mother harbored and the dreams I harbor today, will at long last become reality for my daughter’s generation. That we invest in our people, protect our cultures and embrace unity while we celebrate diversity. That we are responsible for our leaders, and that we – as citizens – own how we come to our collective fate. My country and I, we have travelled a long and windy road together – and we both hear the clock strike midnight on our fourth decade, I’m more convinced than ever that my country’s most exciting chapters are ahead. For just as with the child my mother bore on Independence Day, Papua New Guinea carries something valuable still — the potential. I will think of my daughter as an entering young adult and the road my daughter’s generation has ahead of its. And I will whisper the promise my mother held in her heart: “We are still here. We are still growing. And we’re just getting started.”",Country,Hope,Nill,The National

Untrained public service served well: Former kiap,https://www.thenational.com.pg/untrained-public-service-served-well-former-kiap/,15/09/2025,"A RETIRED public servant who served as akiapin the early 1970s has described how Papua New Guinea gained its independence on Sept 16, 1975. Anton Naseph Wulia, 76, of the Sulka people of Ganaii i n Kokopo’s Bitapaka, shared his experience. Wulia joined as akiapin 1971 when he was only 20 years old and was serving in Southern Highlands. When planter Jack Emmanuel was murdered at Gazelle’s Kabaira in 1971, Gough Whitlam became Prime Minister in 1975, the same year PNG gained its independence. Wulia said during Whitlam’s term as prime minister, he fast-tracked the independence for PNG and extracted all Australia senior public servants serving, leaving behind a big vacuum in all structures of the public service. “I am not afraid to say this and this is the truth, the Australians – cheated us,” Wulia said. “During my time, I was almost everything you can think about in terms of public service. “I was a policeman and also a magistrate because of the shortage of manpower in the rural areas. I exercised a public service role as akiap. “One of the things I realised as mystery is there is a letter written to all the Australian public servants to leave the country and anyone who wanted to stay back will lose their gratuity payment. “They threatened all Australian public servants leaving behind under-trained national staff,” Wulia said. He claims that the education level today is very low or poor compared with the past, before independence. As akiap, Wulia served in Southern Highlands, Manus and in his home province ENB. He resigned from public service after 22 years of service. After leaving public service, Wulia started his own consultancy service in land matters. “I am very happy that I am still around to celebrate and witness this 50 years’ anniversary, my only regret is our generation now are not prepared to take this nation forward,” he said.",History,Sadness,Nill,The National

Moving into the next 50 years,https://www.thenational.com.pg/moving-into-the-next-50-years/,15/09/2025,"PARENTS, teachers, lecturers and everyone have been told to invest well in education as the country moved into the next 50 years. Higher Education Minister Kinoka Feo made this announcement on Thursday during the launching of the Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP) 2023-2027 for the Education Department. “Fifty years ago, our fathers rose to their feet and declared, we are one people, one nation, under God, free and independent,” he said. “Today, we do not just look back, we look forward and we ask what will the next 50 years look like?” Feo said the answer is clear, the future will be written in classrooms, the lecture halls, the workshops and the research labs of Papua New Guinea, the future will be written in the minds of the children. He said the plan that was launched was not just any plan but a national contract with the future. “This plan carries K4.19 billion of investment where it invests in early childhood education because the child who starts well, finishes strong. “It strengthens primary and secondary schools because literacy and numeracy are the foundation and cornerstones of every nation,” Feo said. “It expands technical and vocational training because not every child must wear a tie but every child must have a skill.” He said this plan raises the standard in teacher training and accreditation because a teacher who is empowered would empower a generation.” “The plan also builds the bridges to universities, to science, to research, to innovation because this is the age of knowledge and knowledge is power, therefore this plan needs support from everyone to make it work,” Feo said. He stressed that a plan cannot teach a child, cannot inspire a classroom and cannot raise a nation. “It is only when we together, government, teachers, churches, parents, private sector, students, development partners – only when we rise together and implement this plan, then and only then will it become life and light to Papua New Guinea,” Feo said. “Teachers, you must teach with passion, not just for a salary but for the soul of a nation, parents must value your child’s education and we leaders must resource this plan, not just promise, but we must deliver.”",Education,Anticipation,Nill,The National

Give more powers to provinces,https://www.thenational.com.pg/give-more-powers-to-provinces/,15/09/2025,"PAPUA New Guinea has spent nearly 50 years talking about giving power to the people. The problem is, it rarely follows through. Decentralisation wasn’t a policy bolt-on – it was baked into the country’s founding logic. But the way it’s been handled since independence? That’s a different story. One of hesitation, sabotage, and a slow bleed of local agency. That drift must end. Decentralisation shouldn’t just be an idea to be tossed around or mulled over in every other Parliament sitting. It is an urgent necessity. Before independence, the Constitutional Planning Committee (CPC) laid out a vision. In its 1973 interim reports, the CPC made it clear: most people wanted district governments with real teeth. Bougainville, already pushing for autonomy, submitted its own draft model. The CPC responded by proposing a three-way meeting – national leaders, CPC members, Bougainville reps – to hash out interim arrangements. These weren’t vague aspirations. They were structural demands, laid out before the ink dried on the Constitution. The CPC didn’t want decentralisation to be a bureaucratic gesture. It wanted political decentralisation – actual legislative and executive power at the local level. That vision led to the 1976 Organic Law on Provincial Government. Provinces got elected assemblies, premiers, and control over education, health, infrastructure. It looked promising. But it didn’t last. Assemblies were underfunded, lacked capacity, and couldn’t deliver. Public trust eroded. Between 1983 and 1995, most provincial governments were suspended for “non-performance”. The national government kept the power to intervene, and it used it. In the early ’90s, the 1995 Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments (OLPGLLG) changed everything. Direct provincial elections were gone. Governors became national MPs. Assemblies were filled with Open MPs, LLG reps, and appointed members. LLGs – over 300 of them – were formally recognised, but their powers were limited. It looks like power-sharing, but it’s not. Since then, PNG has tried autonomy in patches. Bougainville, after a decade-long war, got autonomous status in 2001 under the Bougainville Peace Agreement. Its government controls policing, education, taxation. It’s the most advanced model in PNG, but it’s fragile – dependent on national funding and political goodwill. The 2019 referendum, where 97.7 per cent voted for independence, still hangs in limbo. Other provinces – East New Britain, Enga, New Ireland – have pushed for more autonomy under the OLPGLLG. But the national government has been slow to respond. Legal ambiguities persist The CLRC’s 2014 review of the OLPGLLG said it plainly: the law doesn’t clearly define who does what. A centralised government allows for uniform policy implementation across all provinces, like a one-size-fits-all deal, but some of these policies don’t work everywhere. Provinces are not developing at the same rate – some lag behind but would not have to if all provinces managed their own finances and affairs. And where centralised financial control may reduce mismanagement at sub-national levels, that only depends on enforcement and transparency. If there is no transparency, the risk of misuse goes up. Meanwhile, the provinces, districts and LLGs remain under or unevenly funded, which leads to service delivery breakdown, eroded trust and political alienation. Bougainville’s referendum wasn’t symbolic; it was a direct response to decades of neglect. New Ireland, under former Governor Late Sir Julius Chan, was making strides in their push for autonomy with their efforts to be a self-sufficient province. But here’s the thing: decentralisation was never optional for PNG. With over 800 languages and communities scattered across mountains and islands, centralised governance isn’t just inefficient, it’s impossible. Local governments aren’t just closer to the people. They’re the only ones who can respond to their needs. When they’re underfunded, undertrained, and politically neutered, the consequences are obvious: broken clinics, failing schools and roads that vanish in the wet season. This is even more so when provinces are met with natural disasters. In the time the national government takes to consolidate its resources to help, local leadership could be able to step up. The stakes couldn’t be higher. Decentralisation could bring political stability, especially in places like Bougainville. It could also unlock development solutions tailored to local realities. But that takes more than lip service. It demands legal clarity, financial transparency, and a real commitment to sharing power. The OLPGLLG needs fixing. Revenue-sharing must be streamlined. Local officials need training, resources, and authority. And national leaders need to stop treating local governance like a threat, and start treating it like the foundation it was meant to be. Right now, PNG’s decentralisation is a half-kept promise. The structures are there. The substance isn’t.

Vanimo Primary School celebrates with cultural dances,https://www.thenational.com.pg/vanimo-primary-school-celebrates-with-cultural-dances/,15/09/2025,"VANIMO Primary School (VPS) in West Sepik kicked off Papua New Guinea’s 50th Independence Anniversary celebrations on Wednesday, thrilling the crowd with vibrant student cultural dances. The opening gathering drew key figures including Vanimo-Green MP Belden Namah and acting provincial administrator Eric Sakin, sparking joy among the school community. Namah donated K20,000 to the school to support the anniversary programmes, paving the way for a series of memorable events. VPS headmaster Paul Pohu welcomed the guests and thanked them for the backing that made the programmes possible. “Our students are thrilled to showcase PNG’s diverse traditions,” he said. “These activities build their understanding of our hard-won independence.” Young dancers, adorned in grass skirts and feathers, moved to traditional tunes representing cultures from across the nation. Families and locals watched in delight as the performers twirled and stomped in perfect rhythm. Namah stressed education’s key role in building the country and also calling for greater community engagement. “We need to support our schools for a brighter PNG,” he told parents and everyone who gathered there. Sakin supported the message, applauding the school’s push for unity. Other notable guests included Miss Bird of Paradise of Sandaun Carol Hwena and West Sepik acting police commander Senior Insp Silas Kuaino, who were also part of the programme. The celebrations had set the tone for a week of fun and education, building up to anniversary day tomorrow.

The West Sepik authorities were encouraging locals to join upcoming activities and reflect on PNG’s progress since 1975.",Celebration,Joy,Belden Namah,The National
Fun and games from 50 years ago,https://www.thenational.com.pg/fun-and-games-from-50-years-ago/,15/09/2025,"SMALL boys missed a few opportunities for play 50 years ago. Shrieks of laughter and shouting would often reveal the whereabouts of a group of small boys sliding down a steep slope on a section of banana-stem or cardboard carton. Pig bladders became “soccer balls”, and games were soon underway between groups of small boys, while waiting for food to cook during feasts. Children in coastal areas had the sea as their playground. Beautifully made model sailing boats were also raced by children from many coastal villages. Girls had much less time to play. At an early age, they had their energy channelled into practical activities. Tiny girls were often given miniature digging sticks to play with. Older girls became responsible for looking after younger children and family piglets. However, many girls were able to turn that work into play. In some parts of Papua New Guinea, older girls and women entertained themselves and others during their limited leisure times with almost endless numbers of string-figure patterns, often accompanied by stories. Not all games were “just for fun”. Some traditional boy’s games developed skills that would be needed in adulthood, such as quick reflexes required to dodge arrows in tribal battles. Others were to encourage crop growth. For a few weeks each year, ritual spinning-top games were played by men and boys in both the highlands and lowland parts of Papua New Guinea. In the Highlands, the games were played to encourage the development of karuka nuts. In lowland areas, where yams were an important crop, such as the Sepik, spinning-top games were played to encourage the growth of large tubers. Traditionally, with each spin of a top, special words were said to encourage crop growth. Various wheeled toys, wilkas (wheel-cars), that were pushed by a stick or pulled on a string were popular in many parts of Papua New Guinea 50 years ago. The range of ‘wheels’ was almost infinite from cotton-reels to truck tyres, and included discs cut from tree-trunks and fig-fruit. One type resembled a modern grand prix racing car. It was made by attaching between four and eight fig-fruit wheels to a section of banana-leaf midrib. The midrib had a notch cut into it to receive the combined steering and pushing stick. Wheeled toys that were pushed and steered by a stick or length of pitpit cane were most common. As excited small boys pushed them along narrow winding footpaths, they were often accompanied by realistic sounds of a truck double-declutching (‘double-im’) and changing gears. Wheeled toys that were pulled along by string were less common than ‘pusher’ types. Another ‘wheel’ variation was a hoop that could be an old bicycle wheel-rim or cane bent to form a circle that was pushed and steered by hitting with a ‘paddle’, often made from the base of a palm leaf. A ‘game’ that was definitely not for children were greasy-pole competitions. They generally took place at non-traditional gatherings; often to celebrate the completion of a project. Young men formed teams in an attempt to get one of their members to the top of the pole and collect the prizes. The prizes often included money, cooking utensils and tools. Greasy-pole competitions were a great spectator sport. In addition to rugby league, many games were introduced to Papua New Guinea by Australians. Local versions of volleyball, soccer, basketball and cards (‘laki’) were played throughout the country. One of those games, Trobriand cricket, has become truly New Guinean and bears little resemblance to the original.",Culture,Trust,Nill,The National
‘Unseen’ hands that built a nation,https://www.thenational.com.pg/unseen-hands-that-built-a-nation/,15/09/2025,"FOR 50 years, the stitches and the stone, Were set by hands that worked to build a home. Not just of bricks, but of a nation’s soul, A quiet strength that made the different parts whole. They faced the shadows, the anger, and the pain, Weathered the storm and the silent, falling rain. They stood their ground through all the violence they knew, Their spirits brave, and resolute, and true. The bird of paradise, with wings of red and gold, Soared over hills from which of no turning back. A future painted on a tapa, With hopeful yellow and the white of things to last. They learned to wear trousers and the grass skirts too, A testament to what their hands could do. They built a nation from a blend of lands,tok plesand cultures, With courage in their hearts and in their hands. With skilful hands, they’d sew and weave a newbilum, For the silent victories they carry in it. They roll the dough and lovingly knead, And pick the harvest to sow the future’s seed. They carry burdens and they learned to drive, They massage weary souls and keep them strong. In quiet moments, there were tears and kisses too, And moments filled with laughter, bold and new. The stop and cry for all the hopes they’d lost, But carried on, no matter what the cost. From the womb, held the nation’s future child, Their backbone strong, their spirits light. They bore the weight upon their sturdy shoulders, The silent architects, the nation’s steadfast holders. With shells and tusks, and feathers bright and grand, They sang the stories of the troubled land. The rhythm of thekundu, a sacred beat, The mightykumul, rising from defeat. With folded hands and bowed heads in quiet prayers, They found the strength to bear their heavy cares. The pages of the Bible, worn and thin, Held the quiet faith that helped the work begin. They rocked the babies, holding futures in their arms, The hands gave voice to the silent. They cared for health, with skill and mind. In every humble kitchen, warm and bright, They stirred the soup and worked from day to night. And in the morning, brewed the steaming coffee strong, For all the ones who needed to belong. They wove the strongest baskets from the vine, A symbol of a sacred, shared design. Their work, a quiet fire, burning ever deep, The promises their generations had to keep. The bedrock built on quiet, endless love, A nation lifted by the strength of the hands. Their legacy is etched against the stars in the sky, The nation-builders whose work will never end.

The Somare legacy: Leave PNG in a better state than when you received it,https://www.thenational.com.pg/the-somare-legacy-leave-png-in-a-better-state-than-when-you-received-it/,15/09/2025,"SIR Michael led Papua New Guin­ea, together with many eminent and many more unnamed and faceless Papua New Guineans from across the country, to lay the foun­dations of our political independ­ence. They gave us the opportunity to use our immeasurable resources to sustain our sovereignty. It was a time when the winds of political change were sweeping across the South Pacific, South­east Asia, and the Indochina re­gion. Across our wider region, the forces of socialism, communism, and military rule were also rising, shaping and influencing nations in profound ways. Papua New Guinea, however, gained independence without bloodshed or military domination. Our forefathers guided this country into nationhood while protecting our cultural identity and indig­enous rights, embedding those rights firmly within our Constitu­tion. Our Constitution became the framework that created and shaped the laws which regulate and man­age life in our society. In less than 50 years – stretch­ing across four generations – my grandfather, my father, myself and now my son, have each lived under this system. Each generation has been ex­posed to a foreign framework of governance and society, adapting and contributing something new to Papua New Guinea’s growth. The knowledge and wisdom car­ried from one generation to the next have multiplied, strengthen­ing the foundation for the future. Today, I am standing in my son’s generation, just as my father once stood before mine. The knowledge and experiences I have gathered; I will pass on to him. My expectation, just as my fathers was of me, is that each gen­eration should leave Papua New Guinea in a better state than when we inherited it. This is the legacy that I bring to you, the legacy of Sir Michael So­mare, my father. I want to share my reflections about his patience, wisdom, and vision, and why I believe he left Papua New Guinea a better place, filled with opportunities for my generation. It is also why I feel obligated to ensure that my own children in­herit a country where they can live with dignity, hope and pride. The story of Sir Michael stretches across these four generations. He lived for 86 years, and his presence, leadership and values have pro­foundly shaped the chapters of our nation’s journey. I have cited publicly available data from independent institutions that have observed Papua New Guinea’s development over three of these four generations. The World BankFigure 1(below) from Trade Economics, provide a glimpse of Papua New Guinea’s growth. I have taken this opportunity to superimpose Sir Michael’s final nine-year tenure as Prime Minis­ter to show that he did leave PNG, in an economic sense, far better off than when he entered in 2002. Figure 1below shows the GDP of Papua New Guinea, courtesy of Trade Economics, (link pro­vided) I have not plotted his time­line on the graph but you can follow from his political life as I have summarised here. Sir Michael Somare served as Papua New Guinea’s Chief Minister from 1972 (when self-government began) until independence in 1975, then became the nation’s first Prime Minister from 1975 to 1980. He returned as Prime Minister from 1982 to 1985 and again from 2002 to 2011. His official retirement from poli­tics was in 2017, and he spent a total of 17 years as Prime Minister across these separate terms. Sir Michael played a pivotal role through eras of major change, leading PNG to political independ­ence and guiding its political devel­opment over multiple generations. But, he did more than that, he prepared PNG for economic inde­pendence as well, as seen inFig­ure 1where 2002 to 2011 showed the largest GDP growth ever achieved by a government under a single Prime Minister. Figure 2, below (BPNG Data, link provided) shows the external pub­lic debt, andFigure 3, (BPNG Data, link provided) the domestic public debt andFigure 4, the combined data for external and domestic debt. 2002 saw the highest level of debt seen by PNG, Sir Michael took ownership and designed the eco­nomic solutions, reduced level of external debt and borrowing. The economic turnaround was immediate and sustained as debt was curtailed and he designed gov­ernment policy that spurred on the largest wave of investor confidence PNG has ever seen. We have had two successive Gov­ernments that we can now meas­ure and compare how government policy initiatives, legislative and fiscal stability and resource utilisa­tion has impacted the economy. Figure 3 shows the maintenance of legislative and fiscal policy stability and the separation of responsibilities with BPNG management of monetary policy reflecting sustained linear growth in domestic debt under Sir Michael’s political leadership. 2011 to 2019 saw record exponential growth in both domestic and external public debt being achieved and that carried forward past 2019 to today. Figure 4is plotted from data from the Bank of PNG from “the Quarterly Economic Bulletin” (QEB). The QEB provides a very interesting read including data and provides Papua New Guineas the visibility to make an independent assessment of economic conditions. Sir Michael’s journey encapsulates this theme of leaving our country in better stead than what we inherited is best depicted in the first graph, “PNG GDP” this is best read, keeping in mind that he did not stay for consecutive terms until 2002 where he was Prime Minister for just short of two terms. He envisaged the “Sovereign Wealth Fund” for PNG that was tied to the development of the largest resource projects PNG has ever seen PNG LNG and paved the way forward for economic expansion. In 2014, the first gas from PNG LNG left PNG shores and now, 11 years have passed with two successive governments and proceeds from PNG LNG have not entered the Sovereign Wealth Fund. Figure 5(below) is a challenge to Papua New Guineans to take ownership of what we inherit reflect on it and find the solutions for us to leave a better future for our children to grow up in. In summary, the blue line was our economic trajectory under leadership of Sir Michael; the purple line represents where we are today and the green line is Papua New Guinea back on track for economic prosperity. The challenge for us today is to raise the purple curve back to the green curve to get Papua New Guinea back on track for a prosperous nation for our future generations.",Politics,Trust,Michael Somare,The National
The little known story of Kina,https://www.thenational.com.pg/the-little-known-story-of-kina/,15/09/2025,"WHEN a team from the Central Bank of Papua New Guinea looked into redesigning some of the banknotes to commemorate the golden jubilee of the Kina and Toea, PNG’s national currency, they traced back history and stumbled upon Kagua, Southern Highlands. Much is known about Southern Highlands but little is known about Porane village in the Kagua local level government where Kina, Papua New Guinea’s upper unit of its national currency, was born. The story of Kina began with Sir Yano Belo on Saturday, April 19, 1975. Sir Yano was the member for Kagua-Erave and minister for works in the Michael Somare government in the soon-to-be Independent State of Papua New Guinea. During the first cabinet meeting on April 19, 1975, when names for PNG’s currency were proposed and tossed around, Sir Yano threw in the name “Kina”, for the higher denomination, and surprisingly it was unanimously accepted. Finance minister Sir Julius Chan proposed Toea, for the lower denomination. The rest, like they say, is history. But when reflecting on the birth of the currency, Sir Yano recalls that the names proposed and came to cabinet were chosen with careful deliberation, embodying the spirit, identity and dignity of the people. To make this legacy personal, Sir Yano revealed that, the Kina and Toea were also names given to his and Sir Julius’ respective sons, linking the family’s identity to that of the nation itself. Initially, “kina” is the name of the shell money from the coast which people hung around their necks as something valuable. Back then, it was highly valued and respected widely in the Highlands. According toThe National, the word “kina” means, according to a language of Western Highlands, “a store of wealth”. Kina, and of course Toea, as medium of exchange among our people dates back to prehistory and resembles a colourful aesthetic in unity in the transition from prehistory to colonialism as these valuables shells exchanges hands from the villages in the coast to highlands in time. The emergence of the Kina and Toea on the morning after independence came with its own jurisdiction defined and sanctioned primarily by the appearance of our national sovereignty, says Dr Andrew Moutu in his articleMore than a medium of exchange(The National, Sept 20, 2024). Kina and Toea are defined by jurisdiction and legitimised existence meaning it is an authority on its own. On Aug 28, 2025, Prime Minister James Marape unveiled the new K50 note and 50 toea coin at the currency commemorative launching at the Stanley Hotel & Suites in Port Moresby. Sir Yano was invited as a guest of honour at this historic event, which also announced the upcoming new K100 note, set for release on Jan 30, 2026, to commemorate the late Sir Julius Chan, whose vision had shaped the financial destiny of Papua New Guinea. When called up to speak at the event, Sir Yano paid homage to the late Sir Michael Somare, Sir Julius, and all founding fathers and stressed that the strength of a nation lay not only in its institutions but also in the character, integrity and vision of its leaders. He called upon all Papua New Guineans to respect the law, uphold the Constitution and protect the values instilled by the forefathers, reminding the audience that the blueprint of sovereignty, prosperity and divine destiny is embedded in the Constitution. Sir Yano concluded by declaring that the true power of the Kina and Toea would be realised through authentic leadership – leaders who serve, protect and honour the Constitution. The Kina and Toea continue to serve as a poignant reminder of the nation’s journey, its leaders’ vision, and the enduring spirit of Papua New Guineans as they celebrate 50 years of freedom and sovereignty. While Sir Julius, whose image may appear on the new K100 note, and immortalised across generations to come the story of Sir Yano Belo and Kina may hatch in the living memory of every Papua New Guinea.",History,Trust,"James Marape, Julius Chan, Michael Somare, Sir Julius Chan",The National
A personal recollection: PNG’s 50 years,https://www.thenational.com.pg/a-personal-recollection-pngs-50-years/,15/09/2025,"ON the eve of celebrating Papua New Guinea’s 50th Independence anniversary, I wish to reflect on the challenges, experiences, and hopes that shaped our nation’s journey – particularly from the early 1970s leading up to that historic day on Sept 16, 1975. Beginnings: Education and early career Looking back 55 years ago, in 1970, I had just completed Form 4 (Grade 10) at Bugandi High School in Lae. After spending an extended holiday in my home village of Lelefiru, Gulf, I unfortunately missed the opportunity to continue further education at Sogeri National High School. What seemed like a setback at the time turned into an opportunity. In 1971, I secured employment with Trans Australian Airlines (TAA). Back story: I walked in dressed rugged and the expatriate said to me, young man, go get cleaned up, long white socks and come back. Long story short, I quickly cleaned myself up and went back the next day, and there began my career as a trainee traffic officer in Lae at the age of 17. After three weeks of in-house training and three months of practical work in Port Moresby, I was well prepared to join Air Niugini when it began operations on Nov 1, 1973. Growing with Air Niugini From those beginnings, my career grew with the airline. Over 23 years, I held several key management positions in Mt Hagen, Rabaul, Popondetta, Madang, and later internationally in Singapore and Manila. I served as airport manager in Port Moresby, then as commercial director/marketing manager, and ultimately deputy general manager until my early retirement in 1996 due to medical reasons. During this period, Air Niugini became not just an airline, but a symbol of PNG’s identity. It established a training centre to upskill Papua New Guineans, replacing expatriates as their contracts expired. Many of us were sent overseas for specialised training, equipping us with the knowledge to lead in aviation and management. Mood before Independence – the excitement, the uncertainty… In the early 1970s, under the foresight and vision of our founding leaders – most notably the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare – PNG moved toward self-government in 1973. This laid the foundation for truly national institutions: Air Niugini, the PNG Banking Corporation, the Bank of PNG, theNational Broadcasting Corporation, and many others. There was, however, a sense of uncertainty. Many Australians working alongside us were leaving, convinced independence would bring chaos and bloodshed. Yet others stayed, and together we proved those fears unfounded. Sept 16, 1975: A nation is born I will never forget the day at Sir Hubert Murray Stadium when the Australian flag was lowered and the PNG flag was raised in its place. On Sept 16, 1975, independence was declared – and the world saw a young nation stand tall. There was no chaos. No bloodshed. Instead, there was joy, pride, and a deep sense of belonging. For me, the celebrations continued as I marked my 21st birthday the following month, on Oct 24, 1975, at the old Four-Mile Social Club in Port Moresby. A nation at 50 Fifty years on, I remain proud to have witnessed our country’s journey from colony to independent nation. I am proud to have played a small part in building Air Niugini into one of the Pacific’s most successful airlines, which itself celebrated its 50th anniversary in November 2023. Most of all, I am proud to be a Papua New Guinean. Congratulations, PNG, on your 50th Independence anniversary!",Politics,Joy,Michael Somare,The National
Queensland’s PNG community marks 50 years of independence,https://www.thenational.com.pg/queenslands-png-community-marks-50-years-of-independence/,15/09/2025,"Thousands of members of Queensland’s Papua New Guinean community have celebrated half a century of the country’s independence with traditional music, dancing, art, and food. PNG was an Australian territory until Sept 16, 1975, when the country gained independence. To mark the country’s globally significant milestone, the PNG community in Queensland hosted a major festival on Saturday in Logan, south of Brisbane. About 5,000 persons were expected to attend the event, with people travelling from across Queensland, interstate and PNG. Papua New Guinea Federation Queensland Incorporated’s Veronica Henderson said the day was a celebration of culture and independence. She said there had been an “overwhelming response” from the community wanting to participate in this year’s annual event. “We’ve had to assist some of our provincial community groups because they’ve needed to bring people from PNG, not just people also the traditional wear that they needed to bring,” she said. Shanea Fletcher had a stall with handmade grass skirts and flower crowns at the event and said she was proud to share the colourful side of her culture. “The flower crowns are a statement piece,” she said. “They help us feel beautiful. “Independence is a celebration of my country, a coming together. “It’s a lovely warm community and just a wonderful celebration.” Henderson said Queensland also had a bigger PNG population than other states in Australia. The latest census data, from 2021, showed that 17,085 persons in Queensland said they were born in Papua New Guinea. PNG is made up of many different provinces that speak more than 800 languages. Henderson said the festival celebrated each group and their cultural identity through dance, and said they needed to add an extra stage to this year’s event to accommodate performers. “We haven’t turned anyone away,” she said. “We decided that we’d let everyone participate, and we created two stages.” The festival featured around 130 stalls, with a diverse array of traditional food on offer. “Food and celebration of the culture goes together,” Henderson said. “That’s what a lot of Papua New Guineans look forward to – eating food that has been cooked reminds them of home. “It taps into that sense of belonging to PNG.” Michael William Gorogo, from Central, was cooking traditional dishes and said the day meant celebrating his culture in his home away from home. “We’re never going to see this (anniversary) again, so for me 50 years is big,” he said. “We miss everything back home, so the food and dance means a lot to us.” Stall holder Emilia Taatu said it was a special celebration. “It means a lot to me and PNG has come a long way since 1975,” she said. “There’s a wonderful feeling of unity and oneness, we all live in different suburbs and this event brings us together.” – ABC",Culture,Joy,Nill,The National

People will be biggest losers: O’Neill,https://www.thenational.com.pg/people-will-be-biggest-losers-oneill/,12/09/2025,"FORMER Prime Minister, Peter O’Neill says Papua New Guineans will be the “biggest losers” in regards to the Government’s decision to switch banks. O’Neill said: “The decision by Government to switch its banking arrangements from a publicly-owned, dual stock exchange-listed, and well-known bank established in PNG for nearly 70 years, to a government-controlled, freshly-formed bank licenced only eight months ago, is having a devastating impact on Papua New Guineans. “86 per cent of all shares in Bank South Pacific are owned by Papua New Guineans. “Yesterday the value of these shares was wiped out as the sensitive markets, already on high alert due to PNG’s massive corruption and certain grey-listing, reacted negatively to the news the Government was moving all government accounts to the National Banking Corporation. “The workers, retirees, landowners and everyday Papua New Guineans have been dealt a cruel blow. “Papua New Guineans own 86 per cent of BSP and thus, with the stroke of his pen, Marape has cost Papua New Guineans over two billion Kina (K2, 236,000,000) in one single day. “Markets will continue to punish the BSP share price in coming days as the full fallout from the government meddling is felt.” O’Neill said the impact of the decision on landowners would be “massive and unjustified” with Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC) owning 15 per cent of all BSP shares. Just two months ago, MRDC, an institution mandated to invest landowners’ equity, an institution with the Prime Minister acting as the sole trustee shareholder, confirmed they had purchased 70 per cent of the BSP shares held by MVIL taking MRDCs total shareholding to 15 per cent of BSP, making MRDC the second largest shareholder. The MRDC managing director rightly said on July 18, 2025: “BSP is the best performing blue-chip company and recognised financial institution in the Pacific region, providing consistent shareholder returns.” “The landowner companies stated by MRDC as having bought the shares, namely Gobe, Moran, Kutubu, Gigira, Hides No.4, Juha; Angore, PNG LNG Pipeline, PNG LNG Plant Site, and three landowner companies from Ok Tedi, must be absolutely horrified and angry at what the Marape government has done to the value of their recent investment. “The Government would have known at the time that the MVIL shares were sold to these landowners that the value would be wiped out in less than two months. “This is a massive breach of trust and most likely insider-trading to deliberately bring down the value of BSP. “Workers and retirees – the holders of superannuation funds – have seen their investments crumble. “Our Pacific neighbours – the workers of the Solomon Island Islands and Fiji – have also suffered the same fate with their own super funds having invested in BSP has a safe, prudent company. “The timing of this decision could not be worse as PNG faces the tightening grip of the IMF; the Kina slides; jobs evaporate; public debt climbs, and the grey listing seems certain. “The negative impact on our country’s reputation is going to take decades to restore.”",Business,Anger,Nill,The National

"Competition in banking is essential for growth, prosperity, says Minister",https://www.thenational.com.pg/competition-in-banking-is-essential-for-growth-prosperity-says-minister/,12/09/2025,"STATE Enterprises Minister William Duma has welcomed the completion of the first tranche of the private equity raising by the National Banking Corporation (NBC). Duma said that the Government had backed the development of NBC so that the country could have real competition in the local banking system. “As our economy grows, competition between leading banks is essential,” Duma said. “The media have been talking about BSP, but the NEC decision is very clear in that there was absolutely no mention of BSP. “If BSP had consulted its biggest shareholder, Kumul Consolidated Holdings about the impact of the NEC decision prior to releasing its statement to the stock exchange, these issues would have been managed better. “But BSP, unfortunately, did not do so. “Having competition might not sit well with some who have had it good for too long, but that is the reality of economy becoming stronger.” He described the comments by the former prime minister Peter O’Neill on the matter as “mostly incorrect and reflect misunderstanding of the facts”. “This alarmist rhetoric can undermine investor confidence in Papua New Guinea, and ultimately deprive workers of their incomes, if we are not careful,” Duma said. “BSP is one of the most important business institutions in our country and around the Pacific, and this does not change. “As a businessman, (O’Neill) knows that competition is healthy for the economy, and this is what is happening. “So he should get behind positive change instead of talking it down. “Look at our neighbours like Australia. “There is real competition between banks (which) is a good thing. “Our PNG is one of the largest depositors of funds, so it is in the interests of our people and our Government to have options, because with competition, the customer can expect better value when it comes to banks handling money.” Duma said the private equity raising was part of plans to reduce Government ownership of the bank after the initial public offering when NBC was listed on the Port Moresby Stock Exchange. He added: “When BPNG granted a commercial banking license in December 2024 to NBC, one of the conditions was for the Government to reduce its ownership from 100 per cent to a minority stake. “This is underway with more than 50 PNG-owned businesses and citizens investing K100 million in the National Banking Corporation. “We anticipate that NBC will raise of up to K300 million, further diluting the Government’s share.” He said that the other large banks in PNG were dominated by foreign shareholders. “NBC is the people’s bank in PNG, and shares will be sold to Papua New Guineans.”",Business,Trust,William Duma,The National

We wish to be an additional banker to the SOEs (State-owned enterprises) and over time by providing good customer service and product delivery, we hope to be their bank of choice.” “One of the reasons for additional banking licences being issued last year was to create competition. “Sometimes competition can look to be chaotic, but in the end, competition provides customers with genuine choice. “NBC is looking to provide the people of Papua New Guinea with that choice.”",Business,Trust,Nill,The National

Somare-Brash said against the backdrop of 50 years of nationhood, PNG is the living testament to the resilience and adaptability of her father and founding fathers and mothers of this nation. She also mentioned that the recent civil unrest and conflict cast a shadow over the country’s progress, underscoring the urgent need for unity as country the moved forward, “Now, more than ever, there is an urgent need for robust commercial study and principal negotiations that reflect PNG’s dynamic landscape and ensure truly equitable outcomes for our people,” she said. “Recognising the urgency of transformative change is imperative that we prioritise bold, macroeconomic reforms alongside microeconomic strategies that directly enhance household incomes, especially in the informal sectors, SMEs, and MSME.” Somare-Brash added that time has come to demand transparent access to the nation’s vast resources and to renegotiate terms that empower communities and secure economic future.

Ndrou told the students that regardless of political challenges, citizens must respect their leaders, believing that such reverence ultimately honoured God. He highlighted that Papua New Guinea’s true foundation lies not in political figures but in divine guidance. “You must always respect your leaders. You need to understand when you respect them, God will honour you,” he said. “God is the God of our nation. It is not our prime minister; it is not all the members.” Ndrou noted that God establishes and dismantles kingdoms according to His divine will. He encouraged students to discipline themselves, pray daily and remain faithful, asserting that God is the ultimate architect of nations. “Your job is to discipline yourself, study every day and let God take care of you,” he said. The daily events, which included a devotion discussion on leadership, a quiz, fun games and a symbolic cake-cutting ceremony celebrating the birth of PNG as an independent nation, provided a vibrant backdrop to thechairman’s inspirational message.

Rebutting doubts on sovereignty,https://www.thenational.com.pg/rebutting-doubts-on-sovereignty/,12/09/2025,"AS Papua New Guinea prepares to mark its 50th Independence Jubilee on Sept16, a troubling flare of doubt has emerged—questioning the legality and authenticity of our nationhood. This skepticism is fuelled by a curious coalition: Segments of civil society, fringe academics, and the usual chorus of Australian media voices. Among them is Martin Korokan Lomeyari, a former senior civil servant with the Department of Prime Minister and NEC. Korokan’s academic journey spans Sopas School of Nursing (now Innovative University of Enga), Divine Word University, Peking University in Beijing, and currently, a PhD candidacy at Deakin University, Melbourne. He hails from Yaramanda Village, Ambum LLG, Enga. Korokan positions himself as a provocative legal and cultural revisionist—challenging the foundational narrative of PNG’s independence through constitutional law, ancestral heritage, and historical oversight. Here’s a more nuanced breakdown of his stance: I respectfully differ. Let us dissect and rebut each claim with precision and pride. Claim 1: PNG’s independence breached Section 128 of the Australian Constitution.Rebuttal: Claim 2: PNG’s separation lacked indigenous consent and erased Aboriginal sovereignty.Rebuttal: Claim 3: PNG’s independence violated international norms of decolonisation.Rebuttal: Claim 4: PNG’s independence erased ancestral unity and indigenous justice.Rebuttal: – Nationhood is not defined by colonial cartography but by the moral will of a people to govern themselves. PNG chose freedom—not fragmentation. Claim 5: PNG’s separation disrupted shared spiritual cosmologies.Rebuttal: Dignity, legitimacy, and civic soul The anti-PNG critique may be intellectually provocative, but it is legally and morally flawed. Our independence was lawful, consultative, and internationally endorsed. It did not sever ancestral ties—it empowered them. It did not erase justice—it fulfilled it. Let us not allow revisionist nostalgia to undermine the dignity of our nationhood. PNG’s civic soul was born not in breach, but in boldness.

Nawaeb MP Theo Pelgen in a statement said the district development authority had activated emergency road restoration in the LLG to connect the 14 wards to vital government services. “Nabak LLG is also a rugged area in the province and we are trying our best at the district level to ensure people are connected so that service providers like the government and non-government organisations can bring services to the people,” he said. Currently earth-moving machines are on site as work started to upgrade the main Nabak Highway which will end at Bambok to provide access to wards close to Saruwaged Range. Pelgen said the road link will allow accessibility of cash crops such as coffee, cocoa and garden produce, which the people of Nabak, have been producing over the years. Despite funding shortages, the DDA is doing emergency road repairs to access roads as well as the main LLG road link. Pelgen said the Bambok health post which serves a population of over 5,000 people has never been serving the people since it was built under previous MP Kennedy Wenge. “Plans and funds have been earmarked to ensure the Bambok Health Post is up and running.

He called on larger nations to respect the autonomy of PIF countries. “I urge all large countries to respect our right to decide our own relationships and not create disunity within the PIF,” he added. He believes the ongoing review of the PIF’s framework will provide a guide for how the region can engage with development partners and civil society.

The ongoing human rights crisis in West Papua, marked by rising numbers of internally displaced people and increasing violence against civilians, demand urgent attention. Oxfam in the Pacific calls on Pacific leaders to support the appeal for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to be granted unimpeded access to investigate these concerns. “There is precedent for these calls,” said Oxfam in the Pacific executive director Eunice Wotene. “Pacific Island Forum leaders have previously committed to fact-finding missions into West Papua, but accountability for this has been lacking,” she said. “It’s time to honour those commitments and to carry them out with full accountability and transparency.” At the same time, the climate crisis continues to devastate frontline communities across the Pacific. Rising seas, extreme weather and loss of livelihoods are compounding people’s vulnerabilities – particularly in places where human rights are already under threat. Oxfam urged Australia, as a major polluter, to take accountability and increase their share of climate finance to the region, ensuring that Pacific communities have the resources they need to adapt, particularly as Australia bids to host COP31 in partnership with the Pacific.",Politics,Concern,Nill,The National

The Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP) plays an important role in implementing the decisions of leaders in the PIF, Manele said.

Said Nii: “It is about time the Government should amend the current maximum penalty of sexual penetration from 25 years to death penalty and let all the child sexual predators die and rot in hell. “If evidence suggests that the victim was harassed by her own dad then any other male relatives are not to be trusted. “ “The society is rotten causing of people’s attitude and minds to act abnormally, hence the defendant in this case.” The no-nonsense magistrate, while ruling on sufficiency of evidence, said every young female should be loved and taken good care of at all times and should not be sexually abused by someone they look up to for help and shelter. Police alleged that between 2021 to Aug 2023, at Mautana settlement in Port Moresby’s NCD, the accused, of Nondugul village in Jiwaka’s North Waghi, had allegedly engaged in the act of sexual penetration with his daughter who was nine at that time.

He submitted that the charge was defective as there was no evidence in the police file, and asked the court to dismiss the case. The court assessed the accused’s submissions and the police evidence and found that the alleged victim’s own statement is destructive (damaging) and intact and the evidence was overwhelming. “In my conclusion, it is my view that police evidence and facts connects the defendant to the charge. “The allegation should be sustained.” he said The accused was remanded in custody.

Dr Ambi’s corruption-related charges dismissed,https://www.thenational.com.pg/dr-ambis-corruption-related-charges-dismissed/,10/09/2025,"A COMMITTAL Court has dismissed the case of Dr Umadevi Ambihaipahar, better known as Dr Ambi, for failure by police to produce evidence in court. Committal Court Magistrate Paul Puri Nii, in Waigani yesterday, dismissed the case after prosecutor Sgt Sandra Holland informed the court that the arresting officer had not been communicating with her on the progress of the case since Ambi’s arrest. The prosecution asked for an adjournment. Ambi’s lawyer, Jerry Siki, objected and made a verbal application to have the matter dismissed for want of police files. The court refused the prosecution’s application on the basis that police did not show interest in the case. “In my view, although there is no time computation devoted to Section 37(3) of the Constitution on the commonly used phrase ‘reasonable time’, all matters should be dealt with distinctively on their own merit and on a case-by-case basis,” Magistrate Nii said. He said there was also no evidence based documentation explaining the progress of the case and the need for an adjournment if there were any investigations underway. Magistrate Nii said this drew the court into confusion on what the prospects and guarantee would be if the matter was adjourned for police to corroborate the charge. The court upheld the Ambi’s application. She was discharged of the allegations of misappropriation, abuse of office, official corruption, and dealing with criminal property. Ambi toldThe Nationaloutside court that she was happy with the court’s decision. Police alleged that between 2021 and 2023, Ambi – former acting director of the Directorate of Social Change and Mental Health Services – had allegedly abused and misused funds belonging to the Mental Health Hospital worth K1,355,393.08.",Business,Joy,Nill,The National

Buimo remandees raise concern over hearing delays,https://www.thenational.com.pg/buimo-remandees-raise-concern-over-hearing-delays/,10/09/2025,"REMANDEES at Buimo Correctional Service (CS) outside Lae have raised concern over prolonged delay in their court hearings, saying justice is being denied. Alfred Lua Manak, for example, has been on remand for seven years and says it feels like he’s serving sentence. Speaking on behalf of the remanded, Manak said many prisoners similarly have waiting for years without trial, creating a heavy burden on both inmates and the facility. “I am wearing a blue uniform which means I am still waiting for court,” Manak said. “We have not yet been convicted, but for me, being in here for seven years now feels like I am already serving a sentence. For us, delaying justice means our justice has been denied.” He explained that the long wait has left many remandees in limbo, uncertain about their future while separated from their families. Buimo CS commander, Chief Superintendent Michael Wundia, confirmed the concerns, and pointed out that several detainees had been waiting for extended periods. “Four remandees have been in custody for over four years now,” he said. “The others are new, waiting for court or their hearing, but only four have waited for over five years.” He added that the backlog of cases places significant strain on the prison. “Delayed hearing also puts pressure on us in the facility given that the number of prisoners keeps growing every year,” he said. “We try to provide for their shelter and food rations, which is hard. “Keeping them in here for too long without being convicted is indeed unjust.” The remandees are calling on the courts to fast-track hearings to ensure that remandees are given timely access to justice. Their plea reflects the growing challenge in the justice system, where overcrowding, resource constraints, and case backlogs continue to test the country’s commitment to fair and efficient trials.",Justice,Sadness,Nill,The National

The West Taraka community also asked for an outside independent investigation team to investigate what transpired on Sept 6 when two youths were shot and killed and eight others injured allegedly by members of the PNG Defence Force from the Engineering Battalion at Igam Barracks. Community youth leader Ismael Paindo Serum while speaking on behalf of the citizens at West Taraka said the people were asking if the Government could explain to the people why they were being attacked allegedly by the soldiers. “The way they attacked us that fateful morning when everyone were still asleep is like they were trying to attack their enemies in wartime,” Serum said. He said the three disciplinary forces of the Government were meant to protect lives and properties but why did they use arms against the armless citizens when there was no threats leveled at them at that time. “Now, we want nothing but justice to be done by the authorities in relation to the deaths, the injured and the properties that were lost in the fire and by theft,” she said. The community claimed that they knew nothing about the death of a soldier (also on Saturday), and were innocent but were allegedly targeted by the PNGDF personnel. Mother of a student at a primary school that was shot and killed, Kayline Kesna, said she struggled over the years to look after the child only to find her child being shot recklessly with no reason. The tearful mother said that her child was a primary school student who was innocently and brutally killed.

Head teacher Andrew Nasongan said the school had been facing overcrowding, lack of furniture and poor infrastructure. “With almost 50 students per class, four or five students would use one desk,” he said. “Our Tuition Fee Free grant is not much, usually around K32,000-K39,000. “We could only do single purchases upon specific request by teachers depending on their priority.” Nasongan said schools had become dependent on donations from business houses to ease their burden. He participated in a survey questionnaire by the City Pharmacy Limited Group of Companies, landing Bowali as a lucky recipient of the donation, made possible through a partnership with the Swire Shipping. “We only wanted furniture for grades one to three but they’ve given us enough to cater for all grades, even the library and staff room,” he said. “Our students returning from their holidays can now sit on good chairs in term four.” Nasongan said Bowali was a pre-independence school, established in 1963 and received its primary status in 1966. He said some classrooms built then were still being used today. “A school this old should already been transformed to a different level by now,” he said. “We have a big landmass that’s unused, the school still looks the same.” Nasongan said they had a 4-in-1 classroom, water tank and fence built through a donation from the National Fisheries.

The K20.5 million was allocated three years ago for the rehabilitation of the Waghi Mek Plantation by the Marape government. The money has been sitting in the provincial government account until last week. Bando, on behalf of the Coffee Industry Corporation (CIC), presented K500,000 as seed capital to WMP. Kaiwi told the capacity crowd in Banz, the five directors of the board, CIC officials and the Minister that he released the K20 million which was in the provincial account for three years. Kaiwi said it took him that long because the process of getting Waghi Mek back meant it had to go through the process of re-registrations, meeting tax compliance processes, reorganising shareholders, appointing directors, putting in the board and getting the management in place. He said now that the processes are being met and satisfactory for WMP to operate as a company, the fund was deposited into the company’s account.

The centre, funded by the Royal Australian Air Force, was first established two years after independence in 1977 and stands today as the living testament to the two countries’ close relationship. But really the aircraft involves a triangle because a third country is included in the saga. The Douglas A-20 Havoc bomber belonged to the United States Air Force. The opening of the building starts with the aircraft, nicknamed Hell’N Pelican II. “During World War Two, it was in service in Papua New Guinea with 388th bomber squadron before it crash-landed in Madang 81 years ago when it found itself in the firing lines of Japanese Zeros,” Chappell said In 2022, then Air Marshall Mel Hupfeld set the wheels in motion to make sure the aircraft in PNG has a home. Construction of the centre started in April 2023 Chappell said the defence treaty between PNG and Australia, once signed, will further elevate the partnership, and serve to strengthen strategic trust and people to people links fostered between the two countries. “The three qualities that we share are the shared history or experiences, showing up for each other, and mutual respect.” NMAG president Terence Moka said it was conceived through the foresight of the founding father and first prime minister, the late grand chief sir Michael Somare who recognised that PNG’s rich culture and traditions were the existence of the people.",History,Trust,Michael Somare,The National
"Country’s literacy rate improving, says Kombra",https://www.thenational.com.pg/countrys-literacy-rate-improving-says-kombra/,10/09/2025,"EDUCATION Department Secretary Dr Uke Kombra says literacy rate in the country has improved over the years, from 56 per cent in 2000 to 67 per cent in 2010. Kombra said the gains reflected efforts made through formal education as well as non-formal education programmes, run in partnership with churches, non-governmental organisations and Correctional Services. With the release of the 2024 census results soon, the country will then have a clearer picture of the current literacy levels, he said. But Kombra said there was still much to do. “With 2.7 million children in school today, we want to make sure that everyone going to school is able to read and write,” he said. “But those who miss school for one reason or another, we must also reach them through different modes of education,” he said. The secretary called for renewed national commitment to literacy as Papua New Guinea had launched National Literacy Week in Lae this week. He stressed that every citizen must be given the chance to read and write as the country goes into celebrating its 50th anniversary. Kombra reminded the nation that literacy is not only about children in schools but also about adults and young people who missed out on formal education. “Non-formal education is a very important part of our system where we advocate for those who are not literate to be literate,” he said. “We work in partnership with churches, Correctional Services, and non-governmental organisations to make sure no one is left behind in terms of learning how to read and write.” He said literacy remained both a challenge and a national responsibility. “The challenge is still there for us. In the next 50 years, as our education system grows, we must ensure literacy reaches every corner of Papua New Guinea,” he said.",Education,Trust,Nill,The National
Eliminate illiteracy. Minister says 2.3 million remain illiterate in PNG,https://www.thenational.com.pg/eliminate-illiteracy-minister-says-2-3-million-remain-illiterate-in-png/,10/09/2025,"EDUCATION Minister Lucas Dekena says 4.9 million Papua New Guineans can read and write, while 2.3 million remain illiterate out of a population of 7.3 million. The statistics are based on the 2000-2010 national census. Dekena made the statement during the launch of the 30th National Literacy Week in Lae on Monday. He said although 11 provinces had already reached the 70 per cent literacy target, millions of adults and more than 600,000 children still lack basic reading, writing, and numeracy skills. “Tackling illiteracy and innumeracy is a collective responsibility,’ he said. “It is crucial that we support the over 2 million adults and more than 600,000 children in Papua New Guinea who lack these skills. Dekena said the country has set its sights on eliminating illiteracy within the next 50 years. As part of this, the government has declared free education from early childhood to Grade 12 and is creating alternative pathways for adults who missed out on schooling. He said the Government had introduced direct interventions through policy reforms. “If school fees are a problem that keeps our children away from going to school, the government is making education free from elementary, early childhood, all the way to Grade 12. “From now, going into the future, there is no reason for our children not to go to school. Parents, it is your responsibility to ensure that your kids attend because you are not paying any school fees at all.” He noted that the national literacy rate had improved from 56.2 percent in 1980 to 67.6 percent by 2010, representing 4.9 million literate people out of a population of 7.3 million. “The way forward in literacy is to reduce poverty, combat social issues, and improve living standards.

Defence Week ends with airshow,https://www.thenational.com.pg/defence-week-ends-with-airshow/,10/09/2025,"PART of the static air display at the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) Air Transport Wing (ATW) at Eight-Mile was to inspire the younger generation to become pilots and aircraft engineers. ATW commanding officer Lt Col Douglas Vavar said they will need to retire and rest at some point. “We won’t be here for too long, and among the crowd I hope there are children inspired to become pilots and engineers,” he said. The airshow was open to the public between 9am and 3pm on Sunday. The aircraft on display were from  the United States Air Force, Royal Australian Air Force, New Zealand, King Air 350 from Australia’s 32 squadron, C27J Spartan from Australia’s 35 squadron, and PNGDF helicopter Bell 412 that is contracted  under the defence cooperation programme to support operations and three PAC 750 and two CASA aircraft. Vavar said France CASA CN-235 left on Saturday afternoon. “We are the people’s defence force, so we’re very happy that we have given the opportunity for the public to come out here to see the aircraft,” he said. Air movement commanding officer Lt Masonga Yapsie said New Zealand and Australia personnel displayed disaster rescue operations as well as capabilities for conduct of elections. He said during the week they were busy moving cargoes to provinces outside the National Capital District as part of the Planti Balus operation. “We’ve reached about 18 to 20 provinces, moving educational, medical and building materials. Most of the celebration is in the city, but through the operation, we reached other centres of the country,” he said. The display concluded all activities for the PNGDF Week. National flag carrier, Air Niugini, also participated in the spectacular airshow in Port Moresby on Saturday as part of the historic celebrations marking PNG’s 50th Independence anniversary. It joined the PNGDF and international partners in presenting a memorable showcase of aviation skill, pride and unity. Its Boeing 767, P2-PXW, bearing the national colours, was operated by three Papua New Guinean pilots – Captain Maurice Rondeau, Captain Esmond Yasi, and Captain Samiu Taufa. Flying under the call sign Niugini 8050, the aircraft performed controlled manoeuvres, including spectacular “go-around” to the delight of thousands of citizens watching from Ela Beach. Taufa, who is also Air Niugini’s officer-in-charge and acting chief operating officer, expressed his pride in the airline’s participation. “This was more than just a flyover – it was a proud moment for our nation,” he said. “To have Papua New Guinean pilots at the controls of our own national airline’s aircraft, flying over our capital city on such an important milestone, is deeply symbolic. “We thank the PNG Defence Force for including Air Niugini in this historic airshow, and we dedicate this participation to the people of PNG. The people saw their own sons in the cockpit, representing the skills, dreams, and pride of our country.”",Sports,Joy,Nill,The National
Pano ousted. Court orders by-election for Kagua-Erave,https://www.thenational.com.pg/pano-ousted-court-orders-by-election-for-kagua-erave/,09/09/2025,"THE National Court has ordered a by-election for the Kagua-Erave seat in Southern Highlands after finding that MP Maina Pano’s victory in the 2022 General Election was null and void. Judge Colin Makail yesterday upheld the petition filed by Emmanuel Loma Pamea who claimed allegations of illegal practices at polling and hijacking of ballot boxes. Pamea filed the petition based on the allegations claiming that the total number of votes were affected by the illegal practices more than the winning margin. Pano and the Electoral Commission had argued that Pamea’s arguments grounds be dismissed for being incompetent. The court dismissed them on errors at polling and grounds on errors at counting. But it ruled that the grounds on illegal practices at polling (hijacking and stuffing of ballot-boxes) were valid. The court heard that 17 ballot boxes were excluded from counting by the Returning Officer because they were hijacked and contained ballot papers that were not marked by voters. The court found that during the trial, the respondents did not cross-examine the witnesses’ accounts in relation to the hijacking and stuffing of these ballot boxes for the 17 wards in the Erave LLG. “I am satisfied that the total number of votes affected by the illegal practices is 13,561, representing 11,097 votes from the 17 hijacked ballot boxes, and 2,464 votes from two ballot boxes set on fire at the Kagua police station, as the winning margin was 4,550 votes. “The total number of votes affected was more than the winning margin. I am further satisfied that the result of the election was likely to be affected.” He also ordered that the people engaged in the illegal practices be referred to the police for further investigation and prosecution for hijacking and stuffing of ballot boxes with illegally marked ballot papers.",Politics,Anger,Nill,The National

If you look at the plaque under the DC3 aircraft, it mentions that the aircraft was hoisted onto its pedestal on Feb 23, 1979, by Paias Wingti, then the Minister for Transport under the Somare government. Wingti said of that occasion: “This was the last DC 3 to come off the sky. “I asked Air Niugini to put that aircraft up for young Papua New Guineans to know of the history of this hard-working DC 3s. “We bought the first F28s from Nauru Airlines in 1979. “We slowly replaced all TAA and Anett small Fokkers and the DC3s. “Bruce Jeffcott was the first transport minister. I was the second. Okuk was the third.” Their tenure in office was rudely interrupted in March 1980 when Sir Julius Chan overthrew the government in the first successful motion of no confidence.

In his Father’s Day message, Marape paid tribute to the invaluable role that fathers and male figures play in shaping strong families, resilient communities and a united nation. “Our National Anthem begins with the powerful call, ‘O arise all you sons of this land’,” he said. “This is not just a lyric – it is a national responsibility. “As we prepare to celebrate 50 years of Independence, I urge every man and father in Papua New Guinea to arise, take your rightful place in society, and be the role models our children can look up to.” Marape emphasised that the call to arise is more than physical. It is a spiritual and moral duty, rooted in faith, integrity and service. “We must live according to God’s Word,” Marape said. “We must lead by example in our homes, communities, churches, and workplaces. “The country needs men who are grounded in faith, strong in character and respectful in conduct.” Marape also appealed for respect and protection of women and girls, saying that the strength of the nation depends on the well-being and safety of all its people. “To the fathers and men of Papua New Guinea: We are called not just to lead, but to serve with humility, to protect with courage and to love with compassion,” he said. “Let us teach our sons to honour women and girls. “Let us build a culture where respect is the foundation of every relationship.” As the country counts down to its Golden Jubilee of Independence, Marape stated that the future of Papua New Guinea lies in the hands of its families – and the fathers who lead them. “A strong nation is built on strong families. And strong families are built by responsible fathers,” he said. “Let us rise to the occasion, build up our homes, guide our children, and work together for a better and brighter future.” Marape thanked all fathers, grandfathers, uncles, brothers, and male mentors who are standing tall in their communities. “On this Father’s Day, I honour all the men who are doing their part, quietly and faithfully, to raise good children, support their partners, and make a difference,” he said. “Your role is sacred. “You are needed now more than ever. “Happy Father’s Day to all the Fathers in our country today. “May God bless you all and may God bless Papua New Guinea.”",Politics,Trust,James Marape,The National

Justice Minister and Attorney-General Pila Niningi said that many people died without leaving a will, which left their families fighting over their assets through the Office of Public Trustee. He said the Office of Public Trustee, an independent statutory body that acts as the custodian of a deceased person without a will, had come across many cases of people dying without leaving a will on how their assets should be distributed among family members. “This is a very important office that all citizens must know about,” he said. “It is our responsibility to educate the people because many people have left properties without saying anything in a will. “Therefore, I call upon Papua New Guineans to ensure their will expressly states how their properties and assets will be distributed after their death. “No matter how small it may be, there must be a will to ensure that your family can have a fair share of your assets. ‘This will make it easier for the Office of Public Trustee to administrate.” Niningi was at the launching of the Office of Public Trustee’s website in Port Moresby on Friday. “The new website promotes awareness, transparency and efficiency of the Office of Public Trustee services to the people,” Niningi said. “This launch is far more than a simple technical upgrade; it is about our commitment to good governance, transparency, decentralisation and the connecting with our people.”",Law,Trust,Pila Niningi,The National

Teenage pregnancy a factor in school dropouts: Study,https://www.thenational.com.pg/teenage-pregnancy-a-factor-in-school-dropouts-study/,09/09/2025,"A NEW national study has identified pregnancy as a significant factor causing girls to leave school early in PNG, highlighting a critical need for targeted sexual and reproductive health and support services for the country’s massive youth population. The 2024 National Youth Baseline Study, conducted by the Papua New Guinea National Research Institute (PNGNRI), reveals the challenges facing a demographic where young people under 25 make up about 60 per cent of the population—about 7.3 million people. This group is projected to grow rapidly, with the national population expected to reach 13 million by 2032. The study, which surveyed 9,029 youths, found a critically high education dropout rate, with six out of every 10 youths having left the education system prematurely. This aligns with the country’s low literacy rate, where only one in three children complete their basic education. Among the key reasons for discontinuing education, the study found that pregnancy accounted for 4.6 per cent of all dropouts. This figure, representing 309 individuals in the study sample, highlights a specific barrier to education faced by young women and is consistent with data showing that one in six women in PNG gives birth to her first child before the age of 18. The research also indicates that broader family instability directly impacts school attendance. The data shows that 3.7 per cent of youths left school due to their parents splitting up, which often places additional domestic and financial burdens on young women. The consequences of dropping out are severe and contribute to a cycle of disadvantage. The study found that 86 per cent of youths are unemployed, with a lack of qualifications being a primary barrier. This situation is exacerbated by inadequate access to formal education, a lack of job training opportunities and a high unemployment rate, which often leaves young people disengaged and can lead to increased vulnerability and social issues. Furthermore, the environment for young people is challenging. Children and youths in PNG are exposed to the highest rate of violence in the East Asia and Pacific Region, with a large number suffering physical, verbal and sexual abuse. The formal justice system remains inaccessible to most, with less than 20 per cent of child victims having access to courts. The study’s findings point to the necessity of integrated policy interventions. Addressing barriers specific to girls, such as pregnancy through sexual and reproductive health education and family planning, is essential. More broadly, investments in the health, education and employability of this large youth cohort are not just a social imperative but an economic one. Without these investments, the potential of this generation to contribute positively to the nation’s future will not be realised.",Education,Sadness,Nill,The National

Manning, in a report released on Sunday, stated that what happened on Saturday morning was unacceptable. The report states that initial investigations confirmed that those involved in the attack at West Taraka were military personnel.

O’Neill: IMF now admits true state of economy,https://www.thenational.com.pg/oneill-imf-now-admits-true-state-of-economy/,08/09/2025,"FORMER prime minister Peter O’Neill says that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a recent report admitted that the country’s economy is 20 per cent smaller than it should be. “The IMF’s resident representative Sohrab Rafiq has handed down his organisation’s latest economic update plainly admitting (that) the economy is essentially 20 percent smaller than it otherwise would have been if it had continued to grow at its pre-Covid, pre-2019 trend,” the Ialibu-Pangia MP said in a statement. “Despite all the talking from this Government and their proxy controllers of Treasury, the IMF, it is quite something to see this backhanded compliment from the head of the IMF that the heavily criticised economic management under my watch has been recognised as not too bad after all. “The headline numbers cannot be denied – the facts are that in 2011 the total Gross Domestic Product was just under K30 billion and in 2019, when the leadership changed to (James) Marape, the economy was nearly three times bigger at K85 billion. “Gold price, a major influence on PNG’s GDP, was on average US$1,250 (about K5,922) per ounce during my term, compared to US$2,500 (about K11,845) from 2019 to 2025 during the Marape government.” O’Neill said that in simple terms, Marape and Treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey “and their friends at the IMF have enjoyed the benefits of a doubling of the average gold price and yet have failed to translate these upswings in the economy to improvements in our peoples’ lives”. “Instead, we are much worse off with rampant crime and corruption and a cost-of-living crisis, over indebtedness and a chronic shortage of medicines, sliding currency and a drought on jobs,” he said. “It was not perfect during my leadership, but even the IMF now admits the economy would be 20 per cent bigger today if our strategy of managing the economy had continued.” O’Neill, the leader of the People’s National Congress Party said that he did not hold the IMF up as a shining light of economic truth-telling or expertise. “(I) prefer to assess our economy based on how families are getting on, how businesses are investing and how many young people are in good jobs,” he said.",Business,Anger,Ian Ling-Stuckey,The National

First message, a message of gratitude. We are extremely grateful because of the forest that you are preserving for the world. Such a beautiful group of people in such a beautiful landscape, keeping this forest that benefits the whole world. “You have heard about climate change. You know the temperatures are rising. And in the Pacific, there are islands that are sinking. There are droughts that are making life impossible for farmers. There are floods that destroy houses and properties. All this because of climate change. So, thank you very much in the name of the world for the way you preserve this beautiful forest.” Guterres said. Guterres in his second message spoke about solidarity. “I spoke with the Prime Minister (James Marape). He has great plans for this country. To have much more roads, to have much more schools, to have much more health centres. But this is a huge country, full of mountains with certain remote areas. “It’s a very difficult job that he has. And I want to express here a very strong appeal, an appeal to the international community to support the Government and the people of Papua New Guinea, for the people and the Government of Papua New Guinea to be able to accelerate the progress in roads, the progress in schools, the progress in health centres to the benefit of everybody. And the United Nations will be at your side, and will be loud and clear, telling the international community that these beautiful people deserve solidarity, because you are giving the world an enormous gift with your forest.

Guterres said the international finance architecture created in 1975 was outdated. Those institutions with benefit from the presence of PNG when created and therefore there is a need for reforms in international Financial system for country’s like PNG to have a stronger voice and make the right decisions and a much higher access to resources that are essential to the development of country. “PNG has enormous challenges but because it is a middle income country has no access to concessional funding. “This is injustice that must be corrected and therefore international communities must respond to the generosity of PNG and its contribution to fight climate change from its wonderful forests and oceans. “PNG does not contribute to climate change, it has a negative emission record, therefore it needs all the support it can get,” he said.

Urame said this celebration was not for those achievements, but for their contribution to nation building. “Churches worked independently from the government and laid the foundation for social and economic development of the country, many of which are still standing today through church schools and church heath facilities, airstrips, roads and other infrastructures built by the churches,” he said.  “The churches contributed immensely to the human resource capacity of the country and continue to do so, creating an enabling environment for character formation and disciplined life, forming, molding, shaping and grooming Christian citizens and Christian leaders for this country.”",Celebration,Joy,Nill,The National

Other partners in the tattoo were the United States, Tonga, Fiji, Vanuatu, Japan, India and the United Kingdom. “We are privileged to be here and help and be part of Papua New Guinea Defence Force Week and 50th (anniversary) celebrations,” King said. “The 45 persons includes the New Zealand army band that has members from the air force and the Navy. “They will be participating in the military tattoo.” King said they had a C130J Super Hercules aircraft and two NH90 helicopters that were to provide air force support in regards to supplies to a number of parts across PNG, whether it’s medical, educational, or building supplies. The military tattoo consisted of the Royal Pacific Islands Regiment pipes and drums that was raised in 1952. To open the tattoo, Australian Defence Force parachute school personnel and the bands led the event. PNGDF deputy chief Brig-Gen Lari Opa said the New Zealand government, through the NZDF, had over the years been responsive to PNG’s request for help in many of its special occasions and this particular event was no different. “We’re grateful for their helicopters that have done a lot of air movement during the week,” he said.",Diplomacy,Trust,Nill,The National
Military tattoo ends with fireworks,https://www.thenational.com.pg/military-tattoo-ends-with-fireworks/,08/09/2025,"THE two- day military tattoo event ended with fireworks last night at the Sir Hubert Murray Stadium in Port Moresby. The tattoo was part of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) Week celebrations that featured partners from nine different countries. PNGDF’s chief warrant officer Donald Yalom said military tattoos came together to perform only for special occasions like this. “For PNG, we are about to or have started celebrating the 50th jubilee anniversary and that’s why we have the band performing,” he said. “Most of them are brass bands and pipes and drums including our own pipes and drums of PNGDF.” Australian army band music director Major Ben Bonney whose role was to bring together all the bands for rehearsals, said the show included two guards, one from the PNGDF and one from Australia. “The procession into the arena included four cultural groups from PNG and it’s really been an adventure in the last few days, bringing everyone together to do rehearsals and putting on a show for everyone,” he said. Bonney said preparations were always challenging when you have to bring together nearly 500 performers, especially from different cultures where there were always difficulties with language, understanding each other and the heat. “But all in all, we got the show done and we’re all proud, he said.” It’s a great honour and opportunity to lead and international group like this. “The Australian band has 20 members but the band sizes for other countries varies.” The smallest band is from India with 13 members and the largest was the PNGDF with 35 band members.” The bands that took part were the Royal Pacific Islands Regiments pipes and drums, Third battalion Royal Australian Regiment pipes and drums, First Battalion Scots Guard pipes and drums, Tonga, United States 25th infantry division, Indian Navy Band, Vanuatu Mobile Force Band, Australian Defence Force federation guard precision drill team, First battalion band from the Royal Australian Regiments, New Zealand army band, Fiji military forces band and Japan ground self-defence force central band.",Events,Joy,Nill,The National
Delegates arrive in Honiara for Pacific Islands Forum,https://www.thenational.com.pg/delegates-arrive-in-honiara-for-pacific-islands-forum/,08/09/2025,"DELEGATES from the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) 18-member countries are slowing arriving into Honiara, Solomon Islands for the 54th PIF Leaders Meeting (PIFLM). The meeting starts on Monday and will end on Friday with discussions and decisions to be passed on issues surrounding climate change, the Kava declaration, the Pacific Resilience Facility and the Ocean of Peace treaty. Prime Minister James Marape is expected to arrive on Monday to visit the Marine School in Honiara and departs on Tuesday. Marape said the forum was an important platform to raise concerns on the effects of climate change affecting the county and the region. He said there was an immediate need for climate action in the Pacific and Papua New Guinea has to take the lead. Leaders from the Small Island States (SIS) – Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu – met on Monday morning to discuss issues that would be raised during the meeting-proper on Wednesday when all leaders meet. Kiribati President and incoming SIS chairman Taneti Maamau said the group has been recognised by forum leaders for special attention as the most vulnerable members of the Pacific family, due to the unique characteristics of small size, isolation, limited transportation link and resources constraints. “SIS leaders acknowledged the economic, social and environmental challenges SIS face including the intensifying impact of climate change, food security due to limited agricultural potention and very small populations, connectivity challenges resulting from expensive and irregular transport links and diseconomies of scale,” Maamau said. PIF Secretariat secretary-general Baron Divavesi Waqa said the SIS group had a special place in the Forum family. “It is a calling for the expression of our solidarity as the smallest and vulnerable members” Waqa said. “It is also a reminder that our regional architecture must serve all people especially those of the least capacity.” He added that one of the agenda that would be raised in the SIS meeting was the expression of interest by Tonga government to join SIS as a member. “Relatively, there will be a review of the membership of SIS member countries to strengthen self-reliance and sovereignty in the heart of SIS,” he said ",Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,The National
Journos in the Solomon Islands to cover forum,https://www.thenational.com.pg/journos-in-the-solomon-islands-to-cover-forum/,08/09/2025,"MORE than 30 Pacific islands journalists attended a three-day workshop in Honiara, Solomon Islands in preparation for the 54th Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) Leaders Forum coverage this week. Ten of the journalists were selected by the Pacific Islands News Association (Pina) in partnership with the PIF Secretariat to attend the training with Solomon Island journalists. Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele said they were proud to host Pacific Islands leaders with shared visions for the future. “Your commitments in supporting the media across the Pacific strengthens our regionalism and ensures that the voices of our people may be heard,” he said. Manele said the 2025 Forum theme was a reminder of our heritage and a call to our collective responsibility. “In this journey, the media plays a vital role,” he said. “You are not here as observers. You are here as participants and partners in shaping the future of our region.” Manele said the forum would debate strategies and frameworks. “But our people will ask: What does this mean for me, my family or my community? “It is through your (media) work that these answers will be found. You will tell the stories and make the regional decisions meaningful for everyday Pacific Islanders. “I know your work is not easy as many of you operate with limited resources in small newsrooms often with little support.” Meanwhile, the Forum Secretary-general Baron Divavesi Waqa said media coverage in a truthful, fair, balance and accurate way would shape how the leader’s decisions were understood, debated and remembered by the Pacific people.",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National
Afghan quake survivors refuse to return to villages,https://www.thenational.com.pg/afghan-quake-survivors-refuse-to-return-to-villages/,08/09/2025,"MASUD: Haunted by fears of aftershocks bringing rocks crashing down from the mountains, the survivors of Afghan earthquakes are vowing not to return to destroyed villages but camp in fields and on riverbanks instead, even without tents to keep off the rain. “We have no shelter, not even a tent,” said 67-year-old farmer Adam Khan, leaning on a stick outside his ruined home in the village of Masud in Afghanistan’s eastern province of Kunar, devastated last week by earthquakes and subsequent aftershocks. “It rained last night, we had no place to take cover,” he added. “Our biggest fear is the big rocks that could come down at any moment.” Two earthquakes on Sept 1 killed more than 2,200 people and injured over 3,600 across the region, flattening thousands of homes, while aftershocks brought fresh landslides, leaving families trapped between unstable mountains and swollen rivers. Aid groups sped in food and supplies by helicopter, but survivors say help is patchy and slow. Afghanistan’s poverty and inadequate infrastructure maroon many villages hours from the nearest road, while most homes, build of mud and stone, crumbled instantly in the tremors. Families cluster in makeshift camps dotting the area. In the village of Shaheedan, farmer Shams-ur-Rahman, 40, said he lost six relatives and fled with his family of nine. Now they sit in the open beside a road, flanked by their few possessions. “The tents they gave us cannot even accommodate our children,” he said. “On the way down from the mountain, I had no shoes for my son, so I shared mine with him in turns as we walked down.” For some, the displacement looks set to be permanent. In the harsh glare of the sun Gul Ahmad, 51, stood beside his relatives, the women of his family crouched in the shade of a wall as their pop-up tents flapped in the dust nearby. “Even if there is no earthquake, a simple rainfall could bring rocks crashing down on us,” he said. “We will not go back. The government must provide us a place.” Without sufficient shelter, sanitation and food, the trauma will spread disease and poverty in one of the world’s poorest and most quake-prone nations, international aid agencies say. Some of the worst affected are children. Twelve-year-old Sadiq was pulled out alive after being trapped for 11 hours under rubble, in which his grandmother and a cousin were killed beside him. “I thought I would die,” he said, sitting quietly on a rope bed as cousins and uncles milled around the family’s shelter. “It felt like doomsday.” Source: Reuters ",Disaster,Fear,Nill,The National
China-Australia jockeying heightens Pacific forum mess,https://www.thenational.com.pg/china-australia-jockeying-heightens-pacific-forum-mess/,08/09/2025,"Canberra: A Sino-Australian tit-for-tat in Honiara as the two nations try to diplomatically out-muscle one another in the lead-up to this year’s Pacific Islands Forum has been described as almost comical. Australia is providing 61 security vehicles, road upgrades, cybersecurity support and AU$3 million (about K8m) in budgetary aid for the annual gathering of regional leaders in the Solomon Islands capital. China, by comparison, has gifted 27 cars for logistics and basic policing equipment for this week’s summit but the expectation is that Beijing is manoeuvring to play up its part in the proceedings. Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele insists the nation’s own law and order officers will have sole responsibility for everyone’s wellbeing. But echoing in his ears is Australia’s oft-repeated claim that there is no role for China in Pacific security. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a deal with Manele in Canberra in December in which he pledged to fund local policing in the struggling archipelagic nation in exchange for a reduced Chinese security presence there. The Department of Foreign Affairs says consultations are continuing over the expansion of the Solomons’ civilian force but it isn’t willing to talk specifics about the implementation of the agreement. According to a spokesperson, “Australia is committed to supporting Solomon Islands’ evolving security priorities.” Chinese posturing in the region is meanwhile alive and well. It’s naval vessels circumnavigated Australia in February, staging a live-fire exercise in the Tasman Sea. Beijing has also registered 26 new Pacific coastguard vessels and in 2024 conducted its first intercontinental ballistic missile test in the Pacific since 1980. Lowy Institute Pacific Islands program director Mihai Sora says the Solomons policing issue is “a domestic political football that has been kicked around”. There has been “intense and almost comical support” from both Australia and China, he says. “Manele would be under quite a bit of pressure from his Chinese government stakeholders to resist or diminish Australian support for policing.” The former diplomat says he will be looking in Honiara next week for on-the-ground progress on a joint regional policing initiative agreed to at last year’s forum hosted by Tonga. This could include a new development site or upgrades, he says. “And more information from Pacific Islands nations about how it will be deployed or implemented. “Every country was supposed to report back for this meeting. I don’t know if its for a lack of progress or if it’s been overshadowed by more dramatic events.” A diplomatic stoush separate to Australia and China’s jockeying threatened to scuttle the 2025 forum before it got under way, with Beijing pressuring the Solomons to exclude Taiwan, which is a PIF development partner.

Climate finance crunch time at Pacific leader talks,https://www.thenational.com.pg/climate-finance-crunch-time-at-pacific-leader-talks/,08/09/2025,"Canberra: Pacific leaders are set for a more intimate gathering than usual at key annual talks, but excluding some heavyweight nations may prove counterproductive to goals of luring crucial funding for the region. As a major threat to the security and prosperity of small island states, climate change typically dominates the yearly Pacific Islands Forum and the 2025 affair hosted by Solomon Islands this week should be no different. Island nations have long been pushing wealthy, high-emitting countries to help them adapt to the climate problem they did little to create, but accessing global pools of green finance has proven logistically challenging. Pacific leaders have since set up a regional fund they say will be better suited to the smaller, community-scale adaptation projects favoured by the region. Australia, one of the 18-member bloc, has already committed AU$100 million (about K273mil) to the fledgling fund. Wesley Morgan, research associate at the Institute for Climate Risk and Response at UNSW, said the regional heavyweight would be expected to chip in more. “There’ll be an expectation that Australia contributes more and works to leverage that regional fund to attract support from other nations as well,” Morgan, also a Climate Council Fellow, told AAP. But the Solomon Islands’ decision to keep out dialogue partners, including countries such as China, United States, France and Japan, might limit such opportunities. Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele made the call following pressure from Beijing to exclude Taiwan, which is a development partner for the forum. Lowy Institute Pacific Islands program director Mihai Sora said the annual talks had recently become “congested with geopolitical intrigue”, leaving important regional issues, such as health crises, struggling for airtime. On the other hand, attracting foreign climate finance – a priority of many member states – could be challenging with a more closed-off conference. Progress towards a meaningful collective security agreement could also be more difficult in such a setting, the former diplomat said. Sora said the public focus of the 54th Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ Meeting would be on celebrating unity and shared priorities but privately, real differences were starting to emerge on foreign policy. “Some Pacific leaders are leaning into western partners, others are stridently non-aligned, and others are leaning into China and accommodating China’s effective intrusion into the Pacific Islands Forum, an institution of which it’s not even a member,” he said. Sora did not expect this tension to present itself in the leaders statement issued at the end of the five-day event, a document that details key decisions and outcomes from the summit. Morgan said COP31 discussions would also be bubbling away in the background, with Australia yet to secure the rights to co-host the global climate talks with the Pacific in 2026 and muscle out a rival bid from Turkey. “The bid has not been secured, but Pacific countries want to see this happen,” he said.

‘PNGDF won’t comment’: Bougainville Government furious over ‘unauthorised’ Royal New Zealand Air Force flight to Buka as PNGDF remains silent,https://www.thenational.com.pg/pngdf-wont-comment-png-defence-force-tight-lipped-over-unauthorised-royal-new-zealand-air-force-flight-to-buka/,06/09/2025,"THE Papua New Guinea Defence Force have refused to comment on a protocol blunder that has left the Autonomous Bougainville Government fuming over the recent ‘unauthorised entry’ of a New Zealand military aircraft into Bougainville airspace. On Thursday, a Royal New Zealand Air Force Hercules C-130J delivered humanitarian supplies to Bougainville under the ‘Operation Planti Balus’, which stemmed out of the PNG Military Week celebrations. The Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) Attorney General Ezekiel Masatt condemned the unauthorised entry saying the “New Zealand and PNG governments and their military apparatus should know better”. A senior PNGDF spokesperson gave a brief response when contacted for the military’s comment. “PNGDF won’t comment. Only PM (prime minister) and FA (Foreign Affairs),” he said. Masatt said this blunder was a serious breach of the Bougainville Peace Agreement (BPA). Under the BPA, the National Government will be able to send PNGDF personnel to Bougainville for purposes of search and rescue and assistance in natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies in response to requests from the ABG, or by giving prior notice to agreed points of contact in Bougainville. “There was no prior consultation and nor authorisation given,” Masatt said. “At a sensitive time when Bougainville is going through elections, and when the high profile meeting with the UN Secretary General (Antonio Guterres) has just concluded, the unauthorised landing has caused suspicion and apprehension. “Whether the operation is for humanitarian purposes or not is irrelevant.” The Bougainville general election was conducted on Friday. The NZDF earlier said it had sent the Hercules C-130J, a Boeing B757, two NH90 helicopters and more than 40 personnel to participate in Papua New Guinea’s celebrations of its 50th anniversary. The New Zealand Defence Force have been contacted for comment.

"Draw inspiration from founding father’s, says Marape",https://www.thenational.com.pg/draw-inspiration-from-founding-fathers-says-marape/,05/09/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has urged Papua New Guineans to draw inspiration from the nation’s founding fathers as the country prepares to celebrate its 50th Independence anniversary. During the opening of the 50th Anniversary Exhibition in Port Moresby on Wednesday, Marape reminded public servants that the generation which delivered independence between 1972 and 1975 achieved monumental tasks in just three years, without the advantage of modern education or technology. “That generation moved mountains against all odds,” Marape said. “They worked quickly, they worked with dedication. And in just three years, they gave us self-government, a constitution, and independence. Their example must inspire us today.” Marape said the exhibition was a timely reminder that Papua New Guinea’s story did not begin in 1975 but stretched back thousands of years. He pointed to the Kuk Early Agricultural Site in Western Highlands, where evidence of organised agriculture dated back 7,000 to 10,000 years, and the Ambum Stone from Enga, carbon-dated to more than 4,000 years old. He also highlighted Pacific-wide cultural connections through Lapita pottery, the Hiri trade, and traditional shell money, all evidence that Papua New Guineans were part of an advanced civilisation long before modern statehood. “We are an ancient people, with history, culture, and knowledge systems that predate many parts of the world,” he said. “This exhibition must remind us of that heritage, and also inspire us to work hard for the future.”",Politics,Trust,James Marape,The National

In a dinner hosted in Port Moresby by the Prime Minister in honour of the Guterres, Marape reminded the audience of the crucial role PNG plays as the custodian of the world’s third largest tropical rainforest (shared with Indonesia), and the world’s largest ocean (shared with other Pacific Island countries) – both of which contribute largely to keeping the global warming equilibrium. Wednesday night dinner also coincided with the launch of PNG’s National Prevention Strategy (2025-30). He said Guterres’ advocacy on climate action, as high-lighted in his address given earlier that day to Parliament, was fully supported by PNG. “You have come home to a forest nation, you have come home to a marine nation,” Marape said. “Together with the other Pacific Island nations, we host the biggest ocean space on the planet. “We may be small island states in land size and population, but our contribution to global upkeep is second to none. Together with the Amazon and the Congo basins, our forest resources are second to none. “Your address today in Parliament on Climate Resilience and Climate Justice is the correct advocacy. We stand behind you. “We stand in total solidarity with you as your advocate to the Global North and G20 nations, and I speak in front of many G20 ambassadors here tonight. Keep the earth’s temperature below 1.5-degree Celsius.” Marape added that PNG was following closely the United Nations Climate Change conferences (Conference of the Parties) and is paying special attention to COP30 in Brazil this year. Since taking office in 2019, Marape has become a voice on the global scene on Climate Action and Climate Justice, demanding that developed countries do much more to live up to the Paris Agreement of 2015 where 195 countries made the treaty to keep the global temperature below 1.5 degree Celsius. Marape has taken the fight further by demanding that developed countries compensate small island states, especially those in the Pacific who have minimal carbon footprints, for damages suffered as a result of climate change. Marape insisted that PNG should be rightfully compensated for hosting tropical forests which have high economic value for development. He backed that up by not attending the last COP meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan. Earlier this year, Marape also made an appeal to United States President Donald Trump to reconsider his decision when the president withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement and global climate talks.",Politics,Trust,James Marape,The National

Peace ceremony: Bulolo ethnic groups reconcile ,https://www.thenational.com.pg/peace-ceremony-bulolo-ethnic-groups-reconcile/,05/09/2025,"A PEACE ceremony was held in Bulolo, Morobe, on Monday between ethnic groups to reconcile ahead of the country’s Independence anniversary celebrations. This brought together ethnic groups to end years of violence, bad blood, and restore harmony in the township, said project coordinator Archie Yamgar. Also a peace officer, Yamgar added that the reconciliation involved communities from Garaina, Buang, Madang and Finschhafen, who have been in conflict since around 2019. He said according to reports, the clashes, which escalated over time, resulted in killings, property damage, and widespread fear among residents and businesses in Bulolo. Bulolo Urban mayor Jason Ata confirmed that the Bulolo Development Authority (DDA), under the leadership of MP Sam Basil Jr, provided K40,000 to support the reconciliation. “This conflict has been ongoing for years and has taken many lives. “Monday’s ceremony is about ending that cycle and moving forward together.” Basil issued a strong call for the groups to make this the final reconciliation. “The Bulolo DDA has already supported peace ceremonies before, and this must be the last,” Basil said. “Funds should be used to improve schools, health services and business opportunities, not repeatedly spent on reconciliation. “The people must truly stop fighting and live in peace.” The event was coordinated under the Peace and Good Order Committee, supported by the Department of Justice and Attorney-General’s Community Justice programme. Yamgar said the reconciliation was needed in rebuilding stability. “Real peace must come from the heart,” said Yamgar. “This step shows our people are ready to change, and we will continue to extend reconciliation to other groups still in conflict.” The peace ceremony comes as Bulolo prepares to host one of only two government-funded Golden Jubilee shows on Sept 16-17, alongside Port Moresby. The celebrations will feature traditional dances, cultural exhibitions and displays from surrounding local level governments, with joint police operations to ensure safety. Authorities said the goal was for Bulolo to celebrate its independence jubilee free of fear, marking the beginning of a more peaceful future.",Society,Trust,Sam Basil,The National

Pomio installs 10 TB testing machines ,https://www.thenational.com.pg/pomio-installs-10-tb-testing-machines/,05/09/2025,"INSTALLATION of a 10-colour GeneXpert instrument and commissioning of four new tuberculosis (TB) basic management units (BMUs) in Pomio marked a first in East New Britain and Papua New Guinea’s latest against TB. For the first time, Pomio being the first district in the country to have a 10-colour GeneXpert machine now has access to world-class TB diagnostic capacity according to the Health Department. They will be able to rapidly diagnose TB, including drug-resistant TB and genotypic drug sensitivity testing for common first and second-line drugs used in PNG, a capacity only available in provincial hospitals. This innovation and the establishment of BMUs at four health facilities, means that people in Pomio can now access timely, reliable and life-saving TB services closer to home. Last week, the Health Department presented the GeneXpert machine to East New Britain health authority chief executive officer Dr Ako Yap and Pomio administrator John Liskia to help address what may be a dormant health crisis in the district. These developments follow a recent declaration of war against TB by Health Minister and Pomio MP Elias Kapavore, which represented not only a turning point for Pomio, but also a model for scaling up TB response in other remote districts in PNG. The presentation was made by the department’s senior regional medical officer for TB Dr Margaret Kal, to Yap and Liskia in Palmalmal. The installation of the GeneXpert machine was done by a team from the department and East New Britain laboratory team. The installation and commissioning of four BMUs in Pomio was supported by Path — a partner in the fight to end TB in collaboration with the ENB health authority. While thanking the Health Department and acknowledging ongoing support from partners to improve health outcomes in the province, Yap urged health workers to work together to address challenges in the province. “Our people must work together to maximise use of resources. We need to integrate our programmes – government, churches – to serve our people,” Yap said. He acknowledged the work of the churches which ran almost 80 per cent of the rural health services programmes and has eight facilities in Pomio. “At the moment, we do not have good TB services, demonstrating burden of TB in Pomio. “We only have eight BMUs in Gazelle, and we need to work together to ensure we transfer skills to our health workers,” Yap said. The GeneXpert machine was procured with the support of World Bank-funded Coronavirus emergency response project implemented by the Health Department. The machine uses an automated system to perform rapid testing for various diseases, including TB, human immuno-deficiency virus, early infant diagnosis, human papilloma virus, and Covid-19, providing diagnostic results within less than two hours and detects TB with higher sensitivity — unlike traditional labortory tests. The national and provincial TB teams, including partners, visited three facilities as part of their assessment to establish BMUs in the district by next year. “Based on our visits and assessments at the facilities, there is a likelihood of significantly high caseloads, high transmission of TB, and possible accumulation of TB in the community,” Kal said.",Health,Anticipation,Elias Kapavore,The National

‘Champion’ of Papua New Guinea soldiers,https://www.thenational.com.pg/champion-of-papua-new-guinea-soldiers/,05/09/2025,"MAJOR Jack Costelloe worked closely with Papua New Guinean soldiers, police and villagers throughout World War II. That included coordinating labour for the construction of airstrips, participating in civilian recovery operations, organising long-range reconnaissance activities and leading patrols into enemy occupied territory. He spoke highly of the skills and bravery of these soldiers and had been a strong advocate to improve their pay, conditions and status. He believed that they should have received recognition similar that of the much more famous Papuan ‘Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels’. Major Costelloe highlighted that approximately 3,500 Papuan and New Guinean volunteer soldiers, many former police, served during World War II and that members of the First Papuan Infantry Battalion were involved in the first clash with the Japanese on the Kokoda Track, on July 23, 1942. He suggested that ‘Owen guns in the hands of men who were effective fighters with bows and arrows, proved to be a deadly combination for the enemy’ but that often Papua New Guinean soldiers had not been used to their full potential by Australian officers. In 1925, as a 19-year-old, Jack Costelloe took a position as a treasury clerk at Rabaul, in the then Australian Mandated Territory of New Guinea. He later studied anthropology and became a patrol officer and worked in that capacity on Bougainville (Kieta), New Ireland (Namatanai), Morobe (Wau, Morobe and Salamaua), and in the Central Highlands of New Guinea (Chimbu/Kundiawa), until 1942. During World War II, Jack Costelloe was part of the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (Angau) that was responsible for civilian administration, and with ‘M’ Special Unit of the Allied Intelligence Bureau. ‘M’ Special Unit activities included intelligence-gathering and guerilla operations. They included Jack operating with small groups of New Guinean soldiers and police behind enemy lines. In February 1943, along with Bena Force, Costelloe assisted 90 ethnic Chinese residents of Wewak to safety, after Japanese bombing. They had fled to the Ramu Valley and were escorted into the Highlands and evacuated to Australia from Bena Bena airstrip. In June 1943, Costelloe’s long experience in New Guinea saw him carrying out the logistically complex and culturally sensitive task of recruiting and supporting several thousand villagers from the Chimbu area to assist in the maintenance of Bena Bena airstrip and the construction of an airstrip at nearby Goroka. Liaising with United States Marines to develop a strategy to help liberate New Guinea Major Costelloe’s local knowledge of much of Japanese-occupied north-eastern New Guinea, and its people, resulted in him being selected to work with the Americans and provide input to a strategy designed to liberate the area. In August 1943, he was sent to Guadalcanal in the British Solomon Islands – via Australia and New Caledonia – to liaise with the Americans. The strategy that was developed – called ‘island hopping’ – involved isolating Japanese forces in various locations and cutting their supply lines, rather than direct confrontation. The first task was to isolate the main base at Rabaul on New Britain. That would be achieved by establishing airstrips on Bougainville Island – within fighter range of Rabaul – to provide bomber protection during attacks on Japanese positions and shipping. Major Costelloe was appointed district officer of Bougainville to liaise between local residents and the Americans during the establishment of the base. On Nov 1, 1943, Major Costelloe landed along with 14,000 troops of the US Third Marine Division, First Marine Amphibious Corps, at Empress Augusta Bay on Bougainville; to establish a base and airstrips at Torokina. One of his roles as district officer was to organise long-range intelligence-gathering operations by New Guinean scouts. They reported on Japanese military installations and the results of US Fifth Air Force bombing raids. A famous long-range scout who worked with Major Costelloe wasTultulKasman. He operated behind enemy lines to locate enemy installations, assess the results of Allied bombing, and intercept Japanese runners. At times he also flew with US pilots to guide them to targets. Costelloe recommended him for a Loyal Service Medal. Its citation acknowledged that ‘without his assistance (pilots) would have had great difficulty in identifying’many targets. Major Costelloe also led patrols into enemy territory. Over 40 days, during July and August 1944, Major Costelloe led six Australian soldiers and 40 New Guinean soldiers and police from Torokina across the rugged Emperor Range of central Bougainville to attempt to liberate Sikh prisoners being held by the Japanese on the north-east coast. The patrol had several encounters with Japanese patrols on the way. New Guinean police eventually made contact with the Sikhs. However, the Sikh officers were afraid of retribution on those not fit enough to escape and declined the offer of liberation.  They sent Costelloe a note thanking him for his efforts. In July 1945, Major Costelloe was seconded to assist in the development of the newly established Pacific Islands Regiment (later Royal Pacific Islands Regiment). On the Japanese surrender in September 1945, he returned to Angau to assist with post-surrender arrangements in the Aitape area. He was then appointed to the War Crimes Commission as a Special Magistrate, which included dealing with New Guinean collaborators. He appreciated the difficult positions that they had been placed in and was lenient. In mid-1946, he returned to his pre-war role as assistant district officer at Kundiawa in the Central Highlands of New Guinea where he was responsible for the whole of what today is the densely populated Chimbu Province. He returned to Australia in 1949 to work for the NSW Housing Commission in Sydney to help coordinate the construction of thousands of houses required for returning Australian service personnel and their families.",History,Trust,Nill,The National

He told the provincial administrators and governors’ conference that it was a platform for them to assess progress, align priorities, and chart a way for improved service delivery and provincial development. “We appreciate the enormous efforts by the team of academics and technical experts led by Dr Thomas Webster, who have put together an in-depth review of the reforms and provided reports to assist decision making,” Juffa said. It aligns with the work of the bipartisan committee chaired by Governor Luther Wenge and the technical task team led by Webster who conducted a comprehensive three-phase review of PNG’s decentralisation journey. The review examined the 1977 Organic Law, the 1995 Organic Law, and the 2014 District Development Authority Act which spans decades of decentralisation efforts. The team identified systemic weaknesses in service delivery, role clarity, and institutional coordination. “The outcome of the Governor’s conference was a unanimous decision by all governors to return to the pre-1995 provincial government systems,” Juffa said. He added that functions once held at the provincial level will be restored. “The will to change has always been there,” he said. “All we needed was the systems to change.” The move is expected to empower provincial administrations, making them the “engine room of reforms”, aligning budgets with responsibilities, strengthening internal revenue generation and improving financial management. “Governors will remain in Parliament until the transition is complete to a satisfactory level,” he said. “This effort aims to build a provincial administration system that is truly responsive, resilient, and results-driven, ensuring that every Papua New Guinean, regardless of their location, has access to quality services, economic opportunity, and a dignified life, as envisioned by the conference.”",Politics,Trust,"Gary Juffa, Luther Wenge",The National

The fleet open day at the old cargo wharf gave people a chance to step aboard the ship and see daily naval life. Many came for their first look inside a major amphibious vessel. Papua New Guinea Defence Force’s Lt Col Moses Andreas (fromHMAS Tarangau) said the visit highlights how cooperation continues to grow between partners. “It’s good thatHMAS Choulesis here, we have only a few vessels alongside, so this cements our relationship,” he said. “It’s about celebrating 50 years, and looking ahead, step by step, hand in hand.” Visitors toured the vessel and the flight decks guided by Australian Defence Force personnel who explained the ship’s operations and daily life at sea. HMAS Chouleshas previously hosted PNGDF personnel at sea, supporting training and building mutual trust. This year, the ship will assist with ceremonial and accommodation activities of PNG50. Royal Australian Navy medic seaman Makayla Coulson said the day was about connecting with the community and showing the ship’s capabilities. “There were lots of friendly faces and photos.

Judiciary is no subjected to suppression: Judge,https://www.thenational.com.pg/judiciary-is-no-subjected-to-suppression-judge/,04/09/2025,"THE judiciary is not subjected to any suppression or interference from any politician as stated by the Commonwealth Latimer House principles, a judge says. Justice Dr Vergil Narokobi said this when presenting on the topic of Commonwealth Latimer House principles: the doctrine of separation of powers, parliamentary sovereignty and the independence of lawyers and the judiciary on Tuesday during the Continuing Legal Education (CLE) seminar in Port Moresby. “Parliamentarians are able to carry out the legislative and constitutional functions in accordance with the Constitution and free from unlawful interference and fear of criminal or defamation suit,” he said. He said an independent, impartial, honest and competent judiciary was integral in upholding the rule of law in maintaining public confidence and dispensing justice without interference by politicians. “Judicial appointments should be based on three identifying criteria, which should be equality of opportunities, eligibility to all to hold such office, appointment should be on merits and there should be gender equality,” he said. Narokobi said that the relationship between parliament and the judiciary should be governed by respect for parliament’s primary responsibility on the one hand and the respect for judiciary’s responsibility for the interpretation and application of the law as its functions. “They both play a critical role and the independence should be seen as complimentary and constructive and should not be compromised the independence of either one,” he said. He said the principle also talks about public officer holders which includes judges and parliamentarians. “Ministers, MPs, judicial officers and public office holders must always have appropriate guidelines for ethical conducts,” he said. Narokobi said the principle also speaks on the accountability mechanisms and the executive should be accountable to parliament and judicial review should be protected so that the decisions of government were subject of judicial scrutiny. “Government should give adequate time to examine proposed legislation and there should be public input into the legislative process before legislations are enacted,” he said.",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National

Namani said all lawyers in the country should engage in CLE for their professional growth and the society would ensure that was done in order for them to qualify to renew their practising certificates for the following year. “CLE is now in its initial trial period starting this year and next year all lawyers should take enrichment courses as it is a requirement by PNG Law Society,” he said. “In 2027, it will be a requirement for PNG lawyers in order to maintain their practising certificate, that they attend 10 hours of CLE each calendar year.” He also said that mentoring of young lawyers by senior lawyers was a necessary requirement to be taken into consideration by the society. “Mentoring is an important aspect of the legal fraternity as it is part of your contribution to the profession,” he said. “I will be reaching out to some of your senior lawyers asking you to be mentors to junior lawyers,” he said. Chief Justice Sir Gibbs Salika also said mentoring was an important part of the lawyering career as it helps to guide and shape young lawyers in their lawyering journey. “During my time, after my admission from the Legal Training Institute (LTI), I was practising as a probationary lawyer for six months under the mentorship and guidance of a senior lawyer until I could run a trial on my own and I was confirmed as a lawyer,” she said. He said the practise today was quite different with mentoring and career growth of a young graduate lawyer as they were just going into the court unprepared for “sharks like me waiting to attack”.",Law,Trust,Nill,The National

New course needed for Bougainville development,https://www.thenational.com.pg/new-course-needed-for-bougainville-development/,03/09/2025,"Canberra: The sole focus of Bougainville’s leaders to secure independence from Papua New Guinea risks failing to improve the long-term wellbeing of its people, research warns. Almost 98 per cent of people in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, located in the northeast of PNG’s territorial waters, voted for independence in 2019. The referendum was non-binding and must be ratified by PNG’s parliament. It was mandated by the Bougainville Peace Agreement, which was signed in 2001 and ended a decade of civil war between the region and PNG. Bougainville’s leaders have since committed to declaring independence from Sept 1, 2027. A Lowy Institute report by Oliver Nobetau says while the peace agreement laid the foundations for the transition from autonomy to independence, it failed to provide a road map for overcoming key challenges. These include making improvements to people’s quality of life, such as providing access to basic services, employment, infrastructure and governance. “A Bougainville that seeks to achieve independence without a meaningful foundation for development is at risk of replicating the conditions it is seeking to escape,” the report reads. It argues a new agreement is needed between Bougainville and PNG to support socio-economic development and redefine the relationship. It should focus on co-operative efforts for development, measuring improvement through quantifiable targets and outlining the roles and responsibilities of both parties in achieving them. The report says Bougainville’s public service remains “critically underdeveloped” with 400 employees spread thin across unstable and often temporary workspaces. Almost 70 per cent of Bougainville’s public servants believe their institutional set-up is ineffective to carry out mandated functions. The report notes while these issues are also found throughout PNG, they lead to a lack of overall government presence felt within society and prevent Bougainville from exercising its autonomy in any meaningful way while undermining its readiness for independence. “The roadmap for Bougainville’s future should not be singularly defined by independence but must be grounded in development and prosperity for its people,” the report says. Five years ago, former Bougainville Revolutionary Army commander Ishmael Toroama won the presidency for his region on a platform of delivering independence for its some 300,000 people. Bougainville will hold its fifth election for the house of representatives on Friday. Source: With AAP",Politics,Fear,Nill,The National
United Nations’ Guteress commends PNG and Bougainville governments for maintaining peace on Bougainville,https://www.thenational.com.pg/united-nations-guteress-commends-png-and-bougainville-governments-for-maintaining-peace-on-bougainville/,03/09/2025,"UNITED Nations (UN) Secretary General Antonio Guteress has commended the Government for maintaining peace on Bougainville by forging consensus through dialogue. For more than two decades, Papua New Guinea and Bougainville have stayed the course of peace by honouring the UN-backed Bougainville Peace Agreement (BPA). The UN’s Peacebuilding Fund has supported two pillars of the BPA – weapons disposal and the 2019 Bougainville Referendum – where 97.7 per cent of Bougainvilleans voted for independence. When the Government and the Autonomous Bougainville Government reached an impasse on a pathway to table the referendum result to Parliament for ratification, the UN stepped in to fund the work of independent moderator, Sir Jerry Mateparae, to chart a way forward. This resulted in the Melanesian Agreement signed in June which Guteress said exemplified both parties’ willingness to engage in the difficult conversations –– and the United Nations has been honoured to be a part of this process. “Last Saturday (Aug 30) marked the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Bougainville Peace Agreement. This conflict left deep scars,” Guteress said in his address to Parliament on Wednesday. “You have shown the world the path of healing –– through dialogue, perseverance and mutual respect. On Friday, Bougainvilleans will cast their votes in the fifth autonomous election since the agreement. “I would like to salute the President of Bougainville (Ishmael Toroama), the Vice President and Minister for Independence, who are with us here today,” Guteress said. “Thank you for your commitment to these noble efforts. “We are also proud to work in partnership with women, youth and civil society throughout Bougainville. “Your continued dialogue offers a model to other countries, and I am confident that the next phase will deliver a lasting resolution to the mutual benefit of all.” Meanwhile, Guteress said PNG offered a number of powerful lessons to the world despite the geopolitical tensions that has created a volatile new reality for countries around the world. “In the face of these storms, Papua New Guinea offers a number of powerful lessons to the world,” Guteress said. “The first, is the art of forging consensus through dialogue. “For the past half century, you have worked to weave a single nation out of many traditions, many islands, many tongues. “Of course, that task is not easy. But you are determined to move forward, step by step.”",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National

Graduate gets support to build laboratory for herbal medicine,https://www.thenational.com.pg/graduate-gets-support-to-build-laboratory-for-herbal-medicine/,03/09/2025,"A RECENT graduate from the Pacific Adventist University (PAU) received K130,000 from two sources to set up a laboratory to make a heart herbal medicine. K100,000 came from the Markham Development Authority and local MP Koni Iguan gave K30,000 to Allan Thomson for his Raginam Herbal Medicine laboratory last week at Raginam in Umi Markham. Raginam Herbal Medicine is made largely from goose grass. Thomson, a chemistry and biology student, is the founder of Raginam Herbal Medicine. He said goose grass was part of his final-year research project. “After completing my studies I returned to the village where one of my uncles was suffering from a heart condition,” Thomson said. He said they brought him to a health facility and found that there was no medicine to treat him. “When we got back to the village, I decided to use my final research formula and finding to make a herbal medicine from goose grass to treat his symptoms. “After taking two 500ml bottle of goose grass herb for two days, we saw that he recovered very well and then word spread to others about the herbal medicine,” Thomson said. He said he only extracted compounds from the goose grass and separated the minerals then mix with water to make the medicine. “The herbal medicine is made upon request from patients through their medical history and has a shelf life of two weeks,” Thomson said. He said two 500mls of herbal medicine dosage was 125mls taken every six hours for two days. Thompson acknowledged support from Iguan and the Markham authority for the construction of his laboratory and hopes to serve his local community. But he isn’t sure whether he’ll need a licence or clearance from the medical authorities to manufacture the medicine to sell to the public. “This is just a small support from me to our young man to continue what he has been doing,” Iguan said “Since this is my first time here in Raginam village to see what he does, I will only support him with a small amount and see where it takes him.” Iguan said venturing into such scientific practice these days was hard and took a lot of effort, but wished him well in his endeavours. Markham health manager Veronica Waffi said: “During our ancestor’s days, bush or herbal remedies were used widely for all types of illnesses. “Our elders used bark from trees, their leaves that can be boiled and some medicinal grass were taken as medicine. “Even some leaves were heated and placed on swollen parts of the body to be healed. “Now after being educated and being introduced to medical drugs and injections, we forgot about our natural remedies,” Waffi said. She said everyone wanted to take Panadol or amoxicillin for every little illness. “What our young man is doing is good but he has to go through a lot of process in order to achieve that and needs support from everyone,” Waffi said. She said the Health Department had processes and tests that needs to be done in order to be certified as a herbal medicine and urged Thomson not to give-up Waffi added that she was aware that most health facilities were having medicine shortages and were only giving prescriptions for patients to buy medicine in stores that prompted locals to use natural remedies.

Kunyanban warned the people who were issuing the threats to be careful as the threats were sure to cause panic among members of the public as well. “It is a common practice where when police get into a confrontation with criminals, people want to issue threats and now with social media, anybody who feels like making a stupid statement would do so without knowing that the statement is actually a threat,” he said. He said policemen or women were human beings just like everyone else but when their lives came under threat while executing their duties, they had laws that protected them when using firearms. Kunyanban said that what had happened was an unfortunate situation and asked people to stop issuing threats and work with police to keep Lae city peaceful for the 50th independence anniversary celebration. He said police were still investigating the robbery incidents.",Crime,Anger,Nill,The National
Tanam first primary school in Morobe to celebrate independence anniversary,https://www.thenational.com.pg/tanam-first-primary-school-in-morobe-to-celebrate-independence-anniversary/,03/09/2025,"TANAM Primary School in Huon Gulf is one of the first primary schools in Morobe to celebrate the 50th independence anniversary by reciting the speech of Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare on Sept 16, 1975. The school came to live yesterday as soldiers from the Engineering Battalion at Igam in Lae together with representatives from the Seventh-day Adventist church and students took part by reenacting the events that took place then. During the celebration at the school premises, the Australian flag was lowered and PNG flag was raised, commemorating what happened at Independence Hill in Waigini, Port Moresby on Sept 16, 1975. A 10-year-old grade six student, Aaric Jonathan Bampaf from East Sepik was appointed by the student body to recite the speech by Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare. Bampaf was led to the stage to recite the speech. He said: “The day we all have been looking forward for so long has arrived. Today is Sept 16, 1975, we have talked about this day, planned for it and looked forward to it. This country and its people can now enter independence and sovereignty and we will be counted among the family of nations.” He also recited another line of the speech, saying: “We have been lucky as we have not shed blood to gain the independence.” He then recited another line which spoke of those that were involved in ensuring PNG gained its independence like Sir Peter Simogun, Matthias Toliman and many others. The celebrations also saw performances by a women’s group from the United Church in Lae and a mock battle performance by soldiers. Tanam Primary School head teacher Otnie Omali said the purpose of the celebration was to mark the 50th independence anniversary of the country and to inform the students of what actually happened on Sept 16, 1975. He described the celebration as commemorative and informative as many of the students in schools now together with their parents, were not present when the country gained its independence. After the speeches, the 50th anniversary sculpture was unveiled to make the event.",Celebration,Joy,Michael Somare,The National
Primary school in Markham benefits from Australia government funding support,https://www.thenational.com.pg/primary-school-in-markham-benefits-from-australia-government-funding-support/,03/09/2025,"FUNDING support in K93,000 worth of essential infrastructure support from the Australian government will boost the learning of more than 300 students of Itsir Primary School in Morobe’s Markham. School board chairman John Gaif said desks, tables and bookshelves to be received today were funded through the Direct Aid Programme of the Australian High Commission, supported by Grow PNG and Australian Consulate General, Lae. He said these would unlock the potential of their community. “Markham Valley is in a strategic location for agriculture and all other developments,” he said. “Without proper education and supporting infrastructure to help our children’s learning, how sure are we that our upcoming generation is capable of sustaining farming and other business activities on our land and can impact the next generation,” he said. The school, which has only three grades, is the only school serving Itsir village and nearby hamlets of ward 14, Atzera local level government. In 2016, the community with the help of GrowPNG, a private sector partner in agriculture, initiated an early childhood school.

Grey list being monitored: PM,https://www.thenational.com.pg/grey-list-being-monitored-pm/,03/09/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has reassured the Parliament that work is in progress to get the country out of being grey listed. Marape said an inter-departmental committee involving the Department of Justice and Attorney General (DJAG) and other state bodies have been directed to get the country out of the grey list if it does happen next year. Grey listing refers to a country being under increased monitoring by international Financail Action Task Force because of presumed money laundering activities, counter financing of terrorism and other monetary restrictions. Unlike black listing, grey listing means a country is actively aware and working to improve its situation but still faces issues. “The last time we were grey listed was a period between 2014 to 2016 and we got ourselves uplifted out of it and right now in the mutual evaluation programme it is indicated that we might be put back to the grey list next year,” he said. “I want to give assurance to the Parliament that each departmental and agency team has been working for two years to avert the possibility of us going to the grey list but in any case if it does happen in 2026 then I want to give full assurance to the country that just like in 2016 when we got out of the grey list we will do our best.” He said the committee that involves the DJAG, Central Bank, Financial Analysis and Supervision Unit, Finance, Treasury, Police and other agencies. He was answering to Deputy Opposition Leader James Donald queries on how serious the Government was taking the country’s grey listing. Marape said global consciousness on terrorism financing and money laundering had been elevated since the Sept 11, 2001 terrorist attack in New York.",Politics,Trust,"James Donald, James Marape",The National
School to mark nation’s 50 years with reconciliation,https://www.thenational.com.pg/school-to-mark-nations-50-years-with-reconciliation/,03/09/2025,"YOKUA primary school in remote Bulolo will mark 50 years with a reconciliation ceremony to be held this week. The School is in Watut local level government of Bulolo district, and will mark a double celebration this month as it commemorates its 50th anniversary alongside Papua New Guinea’s Golden Jubilee. The two-day programme will not only celebrate the school’s history but also feature a reconciliation ceremony between five landowner groups and key stakeholders. Community leaders believe this symbolic step is vital to restoring the school’s future after decades of struggles. Despite being one of the oldest schools in Morobe, Yokua Primary has faced continuous setbacks since its establishment. Poor infrastructure, lack of resources, and consistently low academic performance have hindered its progress. Local beliefs attribute some of these challenges to a “curse,” linked to the community’s past mistreatment of early missionaries and explorers. Senior teacher Lenny Immanuel said reconciliation is seen as the first step towards change. “For the past five decades, the school has not been operating well, which is reflected in the poor academic results of our children and the rundown state of classrooms and teachers’ houses,” he said. “We want to reconcile with our stakeholders to pave the way forward.” Immanuel has called on the Bulolo District Development Authority, Mineral Resources Authority, Hidden Valley mine, PNG Forest Products, and church partners to support the event. “We don’t have much, but this programme is important,” he said. “We invite our stakeholders to help us, whether in cash or kind, to make this celebration a success.” Yokua Primary is a level-five school and serves students from 10 surrounding villages in Ward 8 of Watut LLG.  With limited road access making it difficult to transport materials, most school buildings are semi-permanent structures. The school acknowledged Bulolo MP Sam Basil Jnr for giving K50,000 towards build a new two-in-one classroom.",Education,Anticipation,Sam Basil,The National
Madang parade kicks off festivities,https://www.thenational.com.pg/madang-parade-kicks-off-festivities/,03/09/2025,"MADANG town saw the province’s biggest parade on Friday. It was the launching of the 50th Independence Anniversary celebration and Madang people showed up in numbers to give it a roaring start to golden jubilee. Locals and foreigners showed up at the town’s Laiwaden Oval, among them an attractive young Chinese woman. As soon as the white Ramu NiCo 25-seat white coaster bus pulled up beside the Raibus Truck which the company used to decorate for the Ramu NiCo float, Joy Deng and her friends hurried out and explored what different corporate businesses were showcasing. Joy has seen float parades in China, but not as creative as what was in front of her on Friday, she said. Even more exciting for her was the fact that her employer Ramu NiCo was the major sponsor of the event and she was actually a participant. Before joining Ramu NiCo, she used to be a spectator in similar parades in her humble Hunan province in South China. Joy was now fulfilling the meaning of her own name, “Joy”, and ventured into the crowd laughing and dancing as she was discovering the splendid display of each float at Laiwaden Oval. To the amazement of some Papua New Guineans, Joy was actually doing a two-step dance that many them were familiar with. She and her friends captured numerous photos for her fond memories PNG. When the float took off from Laiwaden Oval and hit the streets of Madang town for school children to see, Joy saw Madang town too. “I have a comprehensive view of Madang town, and I am very excited about this experience,” Joy said. She said people in Hunan are friendly and loving just like the Madang people, who promoted the friendly culture and expressed “Kagin” in the local Bel dialect. Joy said she’ll remember parade for some time, the huge shark from Talidig, PNG Power’s display, the amazing artwork of a Bird of Paradise by Madang Technical College, traditional costumes and dancing on Sigma float, Air Niugini plane, Spiderman on the police landcruiser open back and many other displays.",Celebration,Joy,Nill,The National

Bougainville marks Patriotism Day,https://www.thenational.com.pg/bougainville-marks-patriotism-day/,03/09/2025,"BOUGAINVILLEANS showed up in colour and pride to commemorate Bougainville Independence Patriotism Day on Monday. The day began with a dawn service at the Hutjena Oval, the same location in Buka, North Bougainville, where the Bougainville flag was hoisted for the first time on Sept 1, 1975. The service, led by the Bougainville council of churches, paid tribute to Bougainville’s political journey and honoured the legacy of key Bougainville leaders. The day’s event was followed by a water taxi float on the Buka passage, and a vehicle float by local taxis and government vehicles in the vicinity of Buka, culminating at Hutjena where the main programme was held. Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) Minister for Community Development Morris Opeti in delivering the keynote address at Hutjena Oval, emphasised the importance of the day and the significant meaning it held for Bougainville. “Today, we honour the meaning behind what happened on the Sept 1, 50 years ago. That day, the Bougainville flag was raised for the first time, even ahead of PNG’s independence. It was the first Universal Declaration of Independence that Bougainville made. And even though it did not receive the recognition it deserved at the time, what it did was instill a spirit of resilience, unity and strength to keep fighting for our political destiny,” Opeti said. He urged Bougainvilleans, particularly the younger generation, to embrace the spirit of patriotism and carry forward the aspirations of past leaders. “That is the spirit that we continue to celebrate today and we must ensure that generations who will come after us, keep this resilience alive. “Patriotism means we must continue to fight, continue to believe in our political destiny, even when the journey is hard,”Opeti said. He acknowledged that while ABG builds by enhancing its capacity and resources, “our target remains clear – independence by 2027”.",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National
Government committed to connecting country,https://www.thenational.com.pg/government-committed-to-connecting-country/,03/09/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to connect every corner of the country by road, electricity, ports, and information and communication technology (ICT), saying the next 20 years will be focused on ending rural isolation and unlocking the country’s full economic potential. Over the weekend, Marape travelled through Central, Gulf, Morobe, and Milne Bay, meeting communities along the new road corridors. He described the trip as “a moving experience” that underscored why the Government must prioritise connectivity for the majority of Papua New Guineans living in rural areas. “From Kupiano all the way to Gadaisu in Milne Bay, I saw almost unanimous support for the missing road link – a 300km stretch that will finally connect isolated communities to the rest of the country,” Marape said. “For the first time, vehicles can now pass from Port Moresby into Central and onwards to Milne Bay. This symbolises our intention: no one must be left behind.” Marape said the road corridor had already revealed vast opportunities in agriculture. Communities in Aroma, Amazon Bay and elsewhere in Milne Bay spoke of more than 100,000ha of land available for oil palm, rubber, coffee, and cocoa. Many of these plantations were abandoned after 1975, but could now be revived. “These roads will pay for themselves. They open up land for agriculture, fisheries, and small-to-medium enterprises (SME). They give our people the chance to move from subsistence into the formal cash economy,” Marape said. He said beyond agriculture, the Port Moresby–Alotau route is poised to boost domestic and international tourism. “This is one of the most pristine environments in PNG, with some of the friendliest people and unique cultures. We want to see guesthouses, resorts and tourism services emerge along this corridor,” he said. Marape also revealed that he was developing a new policy from his office to ensure that rural landowners benefit directly from new road links. “Our people already own land and land is an asset. But it has not been translated into cash value. I am working on a policy to register customary land properly, so that it can be used as collateral for SMEs, housing loans, and agriculture projects,” he said. The policy will link with existing SME and credit facilities, enabling landowners to build decent houses, run small businesses, and invest in commercial agriculture. Marape stressed that the new roads will not only open up markets but also uplift law and order. Police posts will be stationed along highways while laws will be passed to prevent illegal land sales and settlements. The Government also intends to expand supporting infrastructure – including electricity, jetties, airstrips, and information and communications technology services – to ensure rural communities are fully integrated into the national economy. Marape said the road opening was just the beginning of a 20-year vision to transform PNG’s connectivity. “From our 50th Independence anniversary to the 70th, we will build kilometre by kilometre until every part of our country is connected. “Whether by road, sea, air, or ICT – our people must be linked to opportunities,” Marape declared. “When I drove into Alotau and saw boys, girls, men and women celebrating, it affirmed to me that our focus is correct.” He said the other new routes now allow vehicles to travel from Port Moresby through Gulf, Morobe, Lae, and onwards to Madang and the Highlands, something unthinkable a few years ago. “Our government owes it to the rest of the country – especially the rural majority – to unbundle the full economic potential of our land. We will not be distracted by detractors,” Marape said.",Development,Trust,James Marape,The National
Milne Bay man recalls historic walk,https://www.thenational.com.pg/milne-bay-man-recalls-historic-walk/,03/09/2025,"ON Jan 19, 1973, an 18-year-old from Fergusson Island, Milne Bay, made a decision that would shape the rest of his life. Soape Josa was in Form Six at the time when he enlisted in the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, not knowing that within just two years, he would become part of history. By 1975, whispers of independence were everywhere. PNG was preparing to stand as its own nation, and questions were raised about whether its fledgling defence force was ready. “Our defence force was young at that time and there were talks if our defence force was fit or not,” Josa recalled. “They said we must walk first to prove that we are fit.” As a private in Delta Company based at Moem Barracks, Wewak, Josa was among those selected to join a symbolic march to Port Moresby. Soldiers from each company – A, B, C, D, support, and administration – were chosen. From Delta, Josa was one of the lucky few. “They kept us three months in training. After the training, some fell out, some went through, and then they made selections. Among the 16, I was selected,” he said. On May 19, 1975, the group of 16 men began their long march from Moem Barracks. For Josa, the journey came with added responsibility. He had been chosen as the batman, personal assistant and close companion to the commander of the group, Lieutenant Geoffrey Key. “As the batman, I cooked for him, made his tea, and followed him to a location when he wanted to send a message. I did all his work because he was an officer. He could have selected someone from A Company, but he chose me from Delta,” he said. The trek was not easy. Supplies were limited, and the men struggled with poor-quality footwear. “One of the challenges faced during the trekking at that time was we had no proper shoes. Our shoes were Asian made; Australia did not give us good shoes,” Josa added. “Walking through the Markham Valley was especially hard with no roads, just dust everywhere.” Yet, Josa brought more than physical strength to the group, he brought laughter. “I was the clown in the group. I cracked jokes so the soldiers would not miss their kids and families, but focus on the journey we were taking,” he said. Looking back, he shared a message for today’s soldiers: “Discipline is important. “Every Defence Force member must show good discipline to the nation. “There’s no other way to bring PNG up without discipline. “We must lead by example for the young people, including students.” After 21 years of service, Josa retired as a warrant officer. He returned to his community and helped establish the reserve police to continue promoting discipline and order. Today, he lives with his five children and five grandchildren. He will celebrate his 70th birthday next month. And though the years have passed, one nickname from that historic walk still follows him. “Lieutenant Key used to call me kindam, and I used to say, ‘Hey, I’m not a prawn!’ That name stuck with me ever since,” he laughed. From a young private carrying the hopes of a nation, to a grandfather passing wisdom to the next generation, Josa’s story is one of service, resilience, and humour which is a living reminder of the sacrifices behind PNG’s independence.",History,Trust,Nill,The National
Pacific taste of the Australian dream goes up in smoke,https://www.thenational.com.pg/pacific-taste-of-the-australian-dream-goes-up-in-smoke/,03/09/2025,"Honiara: Waltera Foxsiamanu was convinced he had a gold ticket to a better future after obtaining work in a Queensland abattoir as part of the Pacific-Australia Labour Mobility scheme. But when tragedy struck and his family home burnt down, the 32-year-old had to quit the job he’d held in Biloela for most of 2023 and rush back to Honiara to look after his mother. Cutting his stay in Australia short now means his path to resume the lucrative employment opportunity is blocked by red tape. Pacific Islanders can apply for a visa under the Palm scheme for stays up to four years, working in industries struggling with staff shortages especially in the agriculture sector. Due the interruption to his working visit, though, Foxsiamanu is stuck in limbo 2,000km away. As a cab driver, he still lives more among the haves than the have-nots within a subsistence economy that continues to use Malaitan shell-money as its traditional currency. Yet without a way to make it back to Biloela, he wonders for how long. There is a clear contrast between Solomon Islanders who can afford to build larger houses for their families due to their four years in Australia and those who have to crowd into smaller and often dilapidated ones, he says. “It’s really helped to change their life,” he said. “It’s so sad to see people just living in a small, tiny house, yeah, with no rooms, no place for the family to have dinner. “They just use the house for sleep.” Climate change has also had a notable impact on housing affordability in the Solomons, with some coastal dwellers with no choice but to uproot their lives and rebuild on higher ground on the outskirts of Honiara as sea levels relentlessly rise. Improved living standards in the predominantly Melanesian archipelagic nation is about more than just housing, with extra income often allowing families to pay higher school fees and buy better books to advance the education of their children. Poorer parents can still send their kids off to class “but they won’t go far”, Foxsiamanu laments. The more fortunate among Palm scheme workers can eventually return to various of nine participating Pacific Islands along with Timor-Lest, which is just 700km northwest of Darwin, with enough money to build a second house as a rental investment. Most of the significantly higher wages earned participating in the Australian-based arrangement is often sent home to support needy families. Without the extra income Foxsiamanu accumulated while employed in Australia, he wouldn’t be able to complete his rebuild. He says he was able to send back about AU$1,000 (about K2,715) week after deductions while he was part of the scheme, an amount that usually takes a Honiara cabbie three months to earn. His quest for a second shot isn’t hopeless but is an unlikely one for now. “It’s quite difficult, I really want to get back so I can complete the home,” he says. “When we get to Australia life seems to be easy then when we come back in the Solomon Islands, everything is quite difficult.” Australia is using the Palm scheme to spruik a better life for Solomon Islanders as it tries to build stronger people-to-people ties with its near neighbour during an era of increasing Chinese interest in the Pacific. The Solomons per-capita GDP of AU$600 (about K1,629) means it is ranked among the world’s least developed countries. Australia is one of its principal donors. Large billboards throughout Honiara promote the relationship, noting that it helped locals get jobs and support their families. However apparently well-received it is on the ground, though, Palm isn’t without criticism. United Nations special rapporteur Tomoya Obokata has singled out the scheme following a visit to Australia, saying workers are susceptible to modern slavery conditions. Strict rules about visas being tied to a single workplace also make people susceptible to abuse, he says. Workers who disengage from the scheme, where they leave their employer, “face the most significant risks of exploitation and contemporary forms of slavery”, according to his report. “The main issue among those schemes is that they create a significant power imbalance between employers and workers.” The rapporteur says he “received credible information from numerous stakeholders, including from workers themselves, revealing alarming and sometimes severe patterns of exploitation by employers, labour hire companies and migration agents”. Exploitative practices include underpayments, withheld wages, changing contracts, excessive deductions, racial discrimination, hazardous working conditions, harassment, sexual violence and being fired because of pregnancy. A tranche of briefing materials prepared for former federal employment minister Murray Watt about the scheme also reveals concerns around worker safety and treatment. Three critical car crashes in Queensland that involved the death of Pacific Islands labourers in Australia were listed under “sensitivities” in a brief prepared for Senator Watt’s meeting with Pacific high commissioners in Australia in December 2024. Addressing the safety of the visa holders while driving is a major area of concern for nations involved in the scheme. Employment Minister Amanda Rishworth says she is working with them to expand Palm and tackle issues such as disengagement. “Broadly, I get very positive feedback around the Palm scheme but of course, we’re always looking at how we refine it and improve it,” she said on Thursday. “We are working in an ongoing way with our Pacific Island country representative to look at how we can improve the scheme. “We’ll keep looking at how we can make the operation work well for both countries but importantly for the workers.” Source: AAP",Business,Sadness,Nill,The National
Hundreds of former immigration detainees to be deported,https://www.thenational.com.pg/hundreds-of-former-immigration-detainees-to-be-deported/,03/09/2025,"Canberra: Hundreds of former immigration detainees will be deported to Nauru under a controversial deal that has secured bipartisan support. The pact will cost Australian taxpayers more than AU$400 million (about K1 billion) up front and then AU$70 million (about K190m) ongoing each year. It will allow Australia to transfer about 280 former detainees including convicted criminals to the tiny Pacific island, which has a population of about 12,000. Human rights groups and the Greens have condemned the agreement, which was signed by Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke. The deal impacts several hundred people known as the NZYQ cohort, who were released from custody following a landmark High Court ruling on indefinite detention. Shadow attorney-general Julian Leeser said it was a “legitimate arrangement”. “This cohort of people have had ample opportunities to put their case,” he told the ABC on Sunday. “They have exhausted all appeal avenues and the question now is whether they can be removed to another country.” Greens immigration spokesman David Shoebridge condemned the agreement. “This is another secret deal,” he said. “This time a $400 million secret deal, that Labor signed with Nauru to literally turn Nauru into a 21st century prison colony.” The federal government must pass legislation to allow for the removals. Cabinet minister Murray Watt wants to make progress as soon as possible. “It’s not the intention to send the entire cohort in one group,” he told Sky News. “The plan is to scale the number up and allow Nauru to put in place the systems that allow for the number to increase over time.” Senator Watt rejected suggestions Australia was dumping unwanted people including criminals on Nauru. “Nauru is an independent sovereign nation,” he said. “It can make its own decisions about what it wants to do, and the fact that they have reached that agreement with Australia does solve this issue.” Source: AAP",Politics,Anger,Nill,The National

It was to deliver messages, reinforce military coordination and promote unity among the people. Polewara said that it was not only a test of endurance, discipline and teamwork but also a reminder of the spirit of resilience that defined the force and the nation. Yesterday around 4am, 19 soldiers from the Second Royal Pacific Islands Regiment, 23 from Engineering Battalion, 20 from the Long Range Reconnaissance Unit and 15 from the First Royal Pacific Island Regiment cheered each other as they arrived at Unagi Oval for a Freedom of City march to Parliament. Polewara thanked the soldiers who took part in the walk for demonstrating courage and commitment, showing that their efforts were a reminder that the strength of the defence force lay not only in training and equipment but also in the determination and character of each soldier. “They walked 1,200km through Mandi, Tring, Marienberg, Bogia, Madang, Dumpu, Wau, Garaina, and Tapini before reaching Port Moresby,” Polewara added. The exercise re-enacts the courageous trek by 15 men led by Lt Geoff Key in 1975 who walked from Moem to Port Moresby to deliver messages to the Chief Minister Michael Somare and the defence council.",Defence,Trust,Michael Somare,The National

Marape told the symposium in Port Moresby yesterday that if there was one group of professionals who had left an indelible fingerprint in the country, it was those in the medical profession. “From community health workers in the most remote villages to surgeons in our hospitals, you have carried our country for the last 50 years,” he said. Marape described healthcare as a “right, not a privilege”. He recalled his own childhood in rural PNG, where he witnessed families lose children due to a lack of health services and capacity. “As a child, I saw my parents, especially my mother, weep for the loss of her children because basic healthcare was not available,” he said. While reaffirming the Government’s commitment to strengthening basic healthcare, Marape highlighted recent breakthroughs in specialist medical services, the first successful kidney transplant and heart bypass operation. He stressed that these achievements were made possible by teamwork between doctors, anaesthetists, nurses, researchers and technicians. The Prime Minister acknowledged the high cost of delivering world-class healthcare, especially in a country with competing priorities in education, infrastructure, and law and order. Marape said the long-term solution to sustaining healthcare lies in expanding PNG’s economy.

It is part of a plan to create five new districts around country by 2027 to improve service delivery. “This is not only for the new Rabaraba district, but also for the other four new districts that will be created under our 2027 decentralisation efforts,” Marape said. “Bringing government presence to the most remote parts of our country is a key part of the Pangu-led vision to empower our people at the grassroots level.” Marape urged leaders to begin preparing for the transition. “As we allocate resources to these districts, I ask all leaders to ensure they are spread for the greater good and used wisely to truly impact the lives of our people,” the Prime Minister said.",Politics,Anticipation,James Marape,The National
Central city dream takes step forward,https://www.thenational.com.pg/central-city-dream-takes-step-forward/,02/09/2025,"THE long-awaited dream of giving Central its own identity took a major step forward with the first drawdown of K10,000 from the Central City Trust Fund. Under the leadership of Central Governor Rufina Peter, it marks the beginning of the Central city project. Walis Imbal, the provincial finance manager, said: “For too long, Central has not had a face, and I want to leave a legacy where Central has a face.” Imbal recalled the history of the trust fund at a ceremony attended by public servants from Finance and Treasury. “Because the funds remained dormant and unused, a new trust deed had to be issued by Finance,” Imbal said. “We then worked with the acting provincial administrator, Governor and the Finance Department. “We are glad that the Finance secretary approved access of the K27 million specially for the Central city development.” Deputy Finance secretary Tom Tiki said that the two major projects for Central were the Central City and the Central Hospital. Acting provincial administrator Edward Kila called on the administration to rally behind the Governor. “Money has sat there for 15 years and nothing has resulted,” he said. “Let’s use the funds for the purpose intended,” Kila said. Governor Rufina Peter revealed that one of her first tasks upon taking office in 2022 was to investigate the status of Central City. “I knew from my days in National Planning that there was a trust account with funds parked there. When I came in, I wrote quickly to Planning because K300,000 was outstanding to Snowy Mountain Engineering (SME) Company for an independent assessment of the Bautama site. “Despite writing three times with no response, we eventually funded the payment through the provincial executive council (PEC). “Once paid, SME released the report.” The drawdown of the K10,000 is for stationery and represents not just the start of physical works.",Business,Anticipation,Rufina Peter,The National

He said Port Moresby is the epicentre of the celebrations where the main activities will happen. Parkop addressed a short parade by police members from the NCD and Central command. This is the start of a two-week security operation to independence. The parade consisted of 680 members from Special Services Division, general police, policewomen, traffic, police dogs, reserves, Crime and Investigations Division and the police band. “The responsibility of making sure everything goes well rests on your shoulders as we will be having international visitors in the country before and by independence dates. “We have over the past weeks encountered ethnic clashes in the city and other crimes in the suburbs and you will have to ensure you are working nonstop to ensure we maintain peace during this time. “We know police response is not easy at this time when manpower is down, and some of you policemen and women have paid with your lives and that is equally same for the defence and Correctional Service members as well.

Councillor calls for better service delivery,https://www.thenational.com.pg/councillor-calls-for-better-service-delivery/,02/09/2025,"THE East New Britain government (ENBPG) has been urged to deliver basic government services to the rural community, especially the Bainings through its proposed ENB free trade zone. Qaqet Stewardship Council chairman Nicholas Leo issued this call recently in Kokopo. He called on the ENBPG to ensure the proposed East New Britain free trade zone delivers tangible services and benefits to rural communities, particularly in the Baining area. Leo acknowledged the recognition given to local voices in shaping the free trade zone policy, saying the concept offered potential to improve long-standing service delivery challenges. “We are celebrating 50 years of independence based on being a free country, but in terms of road access and connectivity, we still struggle,” he said. “We hope that this free trade zone concept will provide us with connectivity through road access in the next three years.” Leo stressed that the Baining people wanted to be included in the development, noting that areas such as Open Bay and Lassul had potential to become tourist hubs if supported by proper policies. He said this could also help address issues such as drug trafficking by creating regulated opportunities. While initially questioning the free trade zone concept, Leo said he now understood that local communities could still retain ownership of their resources, especially land. However, he warned of risks to culture and traditional practices if development was not carefully managed. Leo also raised concerns about the slow progress in establishing Baining as an electorate, despite its legal recognition. He urged the provincial government to begin preparations for the 2027 elections by recruiting staff for administrative roles and investing in basic infrastructure. “We would like to deliver our political voice in 2027,” he said. “That is where the concept will eventuate, on our land.”",Politics,Anticipation,Nill,The National

The message concluded with the invocation; to God, King and the Country. Joseph said this walk of more than 1,200km was more than just a test of endurance. It was a profound enduring symbol of the military’s original promise to the nation. “In 1975, when a team of soldiers walked from Wewak to Port Moresby, they presented a message of loyalty to our founding father, Grand Chief Michael Somare,” he said. “They affirmed that the new nation of PNG would have its own Defence Force ready to defend its sovereignty and serve its people.” He said for five decades the force had been the guardian of PNG’s sovereignty and a pillar of identity. Joseph said the force was a tool of statecraft through which the Government could achieve its goals, whether it was providing humanitarian assistance, securing borders, or representing PNG on international peacekeeping missions.

As part of the initiative, household solar lighting kits are being distributed and installed across four local-level government (LLG) area in South Fly: Morehead, Forecoast Kiwai, Oriomo Bituri and Fly Kiwai. By early next year, the programme aims to deliver and install more than 8,000 kits across in the district’s four LLG areas. Between May and August this year, the first 1,100 kits were installed in 29 communities in Morehead. Each kit includes a solar panel, three light-emitting diode (LED) lights, and a battery unit equipped with USB charging ports. The introduction of solar energy has been warmly received by the remote communities, providing a cleaner, more affordable and sustainable source of lighting for areas that previously had limited or no access to reliable electricity. Community chief of Morehead Station and Morehead High School chairman Thomas Sumari said the kits do more than provide a source of electricity. “I am grateful that this service has been rendered to my people,” he said. “Seeing their homes light up at night is a reminder of the positive changes that are underway in our region. “With these lights installed in households, our day students can study more effectively at night in the comfort of their homes.” The rollout of household solar lighting kits in South Fly is the result of a collaborative effort involving the Western Province Partnership, the provincial administration, LLG leaders, South Fly Rangers and local communities. These stakeholders are represented in a local steering committee chaired by South Fly administrator Wasewa Saebi. The South Fly Rangers are responsible for on-the-ground delivery and community engagement.

Pomaleu: Time to take stock of projects delivered by the government,https://www.thenational.com.pg/pomaleu-time-to-take-stock-of-projects-delivered-by-the-government/,01/09/2025,"CHIEF Secretary Ivan Pomaleu says leaders should take stock of what has been done over the last 50 years in terms of project delivery and its challenges. “There are so many government-initiated projects that are listed but funding delays and project acquittals have been a critical downfall. That is why alignment is necessary at this time to ensure we overcome some of the challenges faced,” he said. Pomaleu stressed that the Organic Law gives us powers to makes laws and further define our characteristics. “However, there are different levels that should be open for effective and efficient implementation and checks on programme and projects. “What else must we do? Reform is a lifeblood of progress around the world where successful governments and organisations continually adapt to changing realties. We, too, must look critically and ask, how do we represent our people in a changing world? “We need to watch duplications at different structures of government. Over the years, the government has invested in health, education, infrastructure, law and order and economic development,” he said. Pomaleu said it has been observed that the Government must still find alignment and empower. Since Independence in 1975, the country has experimented with difference forms of decentralisation and the proposal from the Constitutional Law Reform Commission (CLRC) that never made it into the Constitution from 1972 to 1974. The 1976 Organic Law looked at integrating autonomy to provinces but it was the 1995 organic law that re-centralised many powers back to Waigani. In 2014, the District Development Authorities Act shifted resources to districts but created new institutional imbalances which caused confusion, hence the call for alignment by leaders. “Despite reforms, the intended reason of empowering provinces has not been fully realised, excessive re-centralisation continues to slow down service delivery as shown in our 22 provinces,” Pomaleu said. “Our people expect fairness, thus the services. It is the leaders, who are collectively responsible to respond to our stakeholders’ expectations. “When national policies are designed far from local authority’s realities, the results cause delays, confusion and disappointment, and this is not a reflection on our people but the systems that we have,” he said.",Politics,Frustration,Nill,The National

Let’s say Lands on customary land matters, what have they done so far? They have to come and advise us on what is being done so far? “This information among key agencies such as Finance, and other sectors also play a key role in achieving this process. Provincial heads are all together trying to get things done, but who is forgetting us in this system at the national level? “Looking at the agenda items, there is so much work in progress, so what is this? And who is going to address us on this. We should be focusing on the problems that we are facing now and that is the lack of funding from the Government,” he said. He said Gulf has not received funding for almost three months and has hindered so much development and work. The governor’s conference, held on Friday, convened a day after the provincial administrators’ conference. Much of the discussions fell on a proposed new provincial government and on previous three proposed organic laws and how line agencies play a part in contributing to a new system of governance.

Kiwi recognised for outstanding service to PNG,https://www.thenational.com.pg/kiwi-recognised-for-outstanding-service-to-png/,01/09/2025,"WHEN squadron leader Chris George of the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) took up his posting to Papua New Guinea in 1986, he knew the mission would be unlike any other in his career. In recognition of his outstanding service and dedication, George was presented with a commendation award by the Deputy Chief of PNGDF Brig-Gen Lari Opa last week. He served for three years (1986-1989) with the PNG Air Transport Wing in Lae, Morobe, a role that demanded not only aviation expertise but also patience and an enduring commitment to partnership. George became known, not only for his professional skills but also his ability to train, mentor and encourage young Papua New Guinean airmen. His focus was always on capacity building: ensuring that the PNG Defence Force (PNGDF) Air Transport Wing developed the capability to stand independently and serve the needs of its people. Looking back, George’s time in Lae highlights the often unseen side of military service; quiet, patient work that builds institutions, strengthens relationships and leaves lasting impacts long after deployments. For him, the posting was not just about aircraft or operations, it was about people, community and cooperation. “There is always a connection with the Christchurch residents and young people, including married Kiwi men who became involved in PNG projects, this involvement created a cultural association and change of experiences,” he said. George highlighted one of the most common skill exchange practices which they did every time apart from his normal aviation duties. “I recall, boat building activities, the focus is on creating boats which were significant both culturally and practically, skills imparted during this activity included traditional and modern boat building techniques,” he said. George also valued the part of storytelling while doing work. He recalled: “Story telling was an integral part of the learning process while building boats, these approach allowed skills to be shared and preserved between the traditional canoe and the more modern fiber glass boats.” Today, George RNZAF is remembered by his colleagues in PNG and New Zealand as a professional who gave his utmost in service of two nations’ shared interest. His commendation is a fitting tribute to a career marked by dedication, leadership and humility.",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National
NCDC to link up CCTV cameras at 80 sites around nation’s capital,https://www.thenational.com.pg/ncdc-to-link-up-cctv-cameras-at-80-sites-around-nations-capital/,01/09/2025,"NINETEEN closed circuit television cameras (CCTV) have been connected around the city to cover 80 sites during the independence celebrations in the National Capital District (NCD). NCD Governor Powes Parkop said by Friday, they should have the other cameras connected to reach 96 cameras across the city. These cameras will create profiles using artificial intelligence (AI) of wanted persons in the city, making it easier for police to track them down at the command and control centre at Four-Mile. “Some of the hotspots will come on the screens that will be monitored by police and other specialists back up artificial intelligence,” Parkop said. “It has no full capacity yet but if there’s a need, we will have more screens. “These screens are enough, the AI will be watching all sites, shifting the cameras to the site that needs immediate attention for facial identification.” Parkop said these all were covered by the National Government funding of K15 million plus K5 million from NCD Commission to improve safety and security. He said that in addition to what they would be installing were cameras from the PNG China Association during the time of Assistant Police Commissioner Anthony Wagambie Jr. “There are a more than 100 cameras already covering Erima, Gordon, Waigani, Boroko, Sabama, Koki and some other parts of the city,” he said. “More than 100 were already in place but they did not have a command and control centre, we will link all of them before Sept 16. “We’re trying to fast track procuring process. “Procuring the cameras and the software and hardware from China and is taking a bit of time but the basic equipment are already here.” Since it’s powered, they (NCDC) are also looking for alternatives to have a standby generator or solar to support the screens when the power supply goes off. These initiative will be supported by a rapid response unit with six new vehicles recently donated by NCDC. Assistant Police Commissioner NCD and Central Benjamin Turi said that these cameras and what they were doing were for the people. “The number of regular police is about 600 and you minus 100 from that for administration and we’re left with 500,” he said. “There are 461 officers in the country that are about to retire and a quarter of that is in Port Moresby. “We’re planning on having all the police officers learn to drive and having every sector have a rapid response unit to respond to clashes in the city.”",Security,Trust,Powes Parkop,The National
PM apologises to Karamui for road delays,https://www.thenational.com.pg/pm-apologises-to-karamui-for-road-delays/,01/09/2025,"PRIME Minister James Marape has apologised to the people of Karamui, Chimbu, for delays in road development and reaffirmed the Government’s commitment to delivering road connectivity under the national Connect PNG programme. He acknowledged that despite previous allocations in 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Karamui road project had not progressed as expected. “We did allocate funds for your road in past years and I have now directed the Works and Highways Department to investigate what has happened to those allocations,” he said. Marape stressed that while other roads across the country had seen continued progress – including Kikori to Mt Hagen, Telefomin to Tabubil and the current drive from Port Moresby to Alotau – Karamui has faced setbacks due to disagreements over routing and competing priorities at provincial and district levels. “We have misfired on this road. “Different preferences on routes have caused delays. I have now instructed the Works and Highways Department to select the best and most direct route into Karamui without further interference. The Government will deliver this road,” Marape said. He emphasised his personal connection to remote communities, recalling his own childhood experiences. “As a child who grew up in remote Papua New Guinea, I understand the pain of isolation. I remember my own mother crying when she lost children in those difficult conditions, with no access to health services or roads. I was only six years old when I saw her bury my baby sibling at Oksapmin. “These experiences shaped me, and they remain with me to this day. “That is why I know the struggles of Karamui and other remote places — and why I give you my fullest commitment that Karamui will not be left behind,” he said. He said communities such as Karamui, Oksapmin, Middle Ramu, Simbai, Maramuni, Kabwum, Rai Coast, Kandrian, Kaintiba, and many others are among the remotest parts of the country still waiting for access, but Connect PNG is designed to change this. “Through Connect PNG we are fixing this. This programme is not just about my government, but about every government that will follow. “It is a 20-year programme, step-by-step, kilometre-by-kilometre — building roads, jetties, ports, and airstrips to connect the unconnected and reach the unreached. “Our mission is clear: no part of PNG remain cut off,” he said. He also pointed to progress at Kaintiba, recalling his earlier visit there in 2020 when the people cried and pleaded for a road. “Today, I am proud that heavy machines are already at Kaintiba, building the road. Just as Kaintiba has now been reached, just as Telefomin has been reached, and just as we can now drive from Port Moresby to Alotau, or from Kikori to Mount Hagen — so too will Karamui be reached,” he said. Marape further appealed to all leaders in Chimbu to allow the national Government to implement the main road corridor to Karamui, while supporting smaller feeder roads separately. “Enough is enough. “Let us work together for the people. Karamui must be unlocked and my government will not rest until that is achieved.",Politics,Trust,James Marape,The National

Islanders get copra weighbridge,https://www.thenational.com.pg/islanders-get-copra-weighbridge/,01/09/2025,"THE people of Rabaul’s Watom Island in East New Britain are set to benefit from a new copra weighbridge. The weighbridge is expected to ease the struggles they have long faced in transporting and selling their copra on the mainland. The facility, which also served as a cocoa buying point, was opened during the same event as the launch of the new Watom Island Beach Resort. For years, islanders have relied solely on boats to travel to the mainland to sell their copra, often risking their lives at sea and spending large sums on transport costs. The new facility now provides a safer and closer option for selling their produce. The weighbridge is owned by Daniel Tolulu and January Daniel, who said the initiative was driven by their desire to support their community. “We have a heart for our people. “Even though we struggle at times, we are doing this for the benefit of the people of Watom Island,” Daniel said. She explained that in the past, copra was weighed using a hanging scale, but with the upgrade to a weighbridge, farmers on the island now have access to more accurate and efficient measurements. Daniel also highlighted the difficulties previously faced by herself and her husband, including late travel by boat to the mainland. In some cases, they arrive late after the Coconut Products Limited (CPL) office had already closed, forcing them to sleep at the beach until the next day. Another common challenge was fuel shortages. When boats ran out of fuel and fuel stations were closed, they were often stranded overnight on the mainland. The weighbridge, located at Nabil village in Vunakabi, Watom, is the only one of its kind on the island.",Business,Joy,Nill,The National

K340 million port for WNB,https://www.thenational.com.pg/k340-million-port-for-wnb/,01/09/2025,"PNG Ports Corporation Limited (PNG Ports) will be delivering a ‘climate change resilient’ K340 million port to the people of West New Britain. This will also bring more than 300 immediate jobs, spin-off benefits for the locals, and multiple future business opportunities. During a ground-breaking ceremony on Friday, PNG Ports chairman Harvey Nii said this significant investment was for the people of West New Britain who housed Kimbe Port – PNG Ports’ third busiest port. Nii explained that the 16-month project would see the existing port undergo “major marine and land rehabilitation works” to increase cargo volumes and vessel traffic by 2027. He said upon completion, the upgraded port infrastructure will be climate resilient, with the incorporation of climate change, disaster resilience and social inclusion in the project design. The Kimbe Port is critical to the growth of the New Guinea Islands. Last year, 252 vessels were received at the port, with a throughput of over 450,000 revenue tonnages, much of this is attributed to the trade of crude oil palm, cocoa, vanilla, copra, fish and logging. State Enterprises Minister William Duma said this crucial project marked a “transformative chapter” for the province. “We must remind ourselves that we are not merely launching a construction project, we are laying the foundation for enhanced connectivity, stronger national unity, and sustainable prosperity for generations to come,” Duma said. “As our country marks 50 years of independence, it is a moment for all of us to reflect on our achievements, acknowledge all the obstacles we had to overcome over the years, and renew our commitment to building a new future for our children and our grandchildren.” The project is being funded by the Australian Government through the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP). Australian high commissioner Ewen McDonald was also in the province to co-officiate during the event with Duma, witnessed by provincial parliamentary leaders, AIFFP head Jonathan Kenna, government departmental heads, and leaders of traditional landowner groups. McDonald said: “The PNG Australia relationship is a relationship between family. “Our modern day relationship is about supporting conditions for economic prosperity. “We’re investing in high quality, sustainable infrastructure. “Investments in roads, ports, power and telecommunications are all fundamental for creating an environment where businesses can thrive, and communities can prosper.” The project has been divided into the land and marine component, with Global Constructions Limited and Pacific Marine Group to carry these out respectively.",Business,Trust,William Duma,The National

A group of 16 soldiers embarked on a 1,200km-walk led by Lt Geoffrey Key and took 64 days to arrive at Taurama. Private Kenny Malulu, then 24, from Northern’s Biage village in the Kokoda Local Level Government was part of that historic journey. Now 74, Malulu vividly recalls the journey. “We were given messages placed nicely in envelopes and were given clear instructions to pass it on,” he said. “We were told to live off the land. “We had no idea of the content. “At that time, it was approved that chief minister Michael Somare be the Prime Minister. “Our bosses at Moem wrote letters to support the decision. “We walked (carrying the) letters to show our commitment. “Announcements were made through the radio about the walk and people were asked to provide us rations along the way.” Malulu said that they went past Brandi then took a short-cut to Murik Lake and then to Angoram where they got on two dinghies to cross the Sepik River. They faced rugged terrain and unpredictable weather, but their camaraderie and determination kept them going. The team overnighted across the river and set off the next day to Ramu in Madang. They took on a canoe to take them across the river to Bogia. “We followed the beach all the way to Bogia station and overnighted at a school,” Malulu said. “In the morning, we left Bogia and walked the highway till we reached Madang town around 5.30am. “We went to the police barracks to rest.” They left Madang along the highway and rested for two nights. On the third night, they rested near the Highlands highway. Of the 15, three were married. Malulu and his other friends were single at that time. They were ready for such an adventure to prove that the country has a strong army. “It was lovely meeting people along the way who were so proud to see us and offered us shelter and food. One of the challenges was finding clean drinking water. Drivers along the highway offered to help but Key said no.” The name “Antap Long Ol” described how soldiers crossed provinces to get into Port Moresby.

Central bank launches commemorative banknote and coin,https://www.thenational.com.pg/central-bank-launches-commemorative-banknote-and-coin/,29/08/2025,"THE Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) yesterday marked a historic double milestone, the nation’s 50th Anniversary of Independence and 50 years of its own national currency, with the launch of a commemorative K50 banknote and 50t coin. BPNG Assistant Governor for Currency and branch operations Ron Sikar said 20 million pieces of the new K50 banknotes and 2.5 million pieces of the new 50t coin have already been received by the banks. Governor Elizabeth Genia led the ceremony in the presence of Prime Minister James Marape, Foreign Affairs Minister Justin Tkatchenko, members of the Government, representatives of the business and diplomatic communities, and family members of the nation’s founding leaders. “Papua New Guineans will see the new currency in circulation,” Genia said. “The K50 note retains Parliament House, continues to honour Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare and carries the golden 50th Anniversary emblem with the Raggiana Bird of Paradise in flight, symbolising the nation’s future. “The 50t coin keeps its iconic seven-sided shape and crest, now joined by a coloured inlay of the PNG flag, representing unity and progress.” Genia paid tribute to the late Grand Chief, describing his legacy as a guiding presence throughout the anniversary celebrations. She also acknowledged the late Sir Julius Chan, who as Finance Minister in 1975 drove the establishment of the Kina and Toea, and the late Sir Henry ToRobert, the nation’s first Central Bank Governor, who guided the transition with professionalism and authority. She said next year, the BPNG would issue a redesigned K100 note featuring Sir Julius. “The new design celebrates our currency history and trading spirit, a fitting recognition of Sir Julius as our first finance minister and as a nation-builder who placed PNG in the world.” Genia recalled that the introduction of the kina and toea in 1975 was a national education campaign in itself. Booklets and posters were distributed in English, Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu. Radio and press campaigns explained the denominations and designs. And banks trained their staff with specimen notes. To ease the transition, the Kina was set equal in value to the Australian dollar and both currencies circulated side by side until the end of 1975. Farmers and smallholders were initially cautious, but confidence grew quickly as the Kina and Toea became embedded in daily life. “Fifty years ago, the notes and coins represented the first heartbeats of our nation. Today they are the backbone of our economy,” Genia said. The names themselves – Kina (pearl shell) and Toea (small trade shell) – reflected ancient systems of value and exchange. “By choosing these names, our leaders embedded culture into the heart of our economy. Every Kina and Toea carries our heritage into the modern economy,” she said. Genia reaffirmed BPNG’s focus. “We will sustain price stability, manage exchange rates responsibly and expand access to financial services to all Papua New Guineans. “This is not just economic housekeeping. It is the unfinished business of independence. “From now on, may every Kina and Toea carry our pride and our promise.” The commemorative K50 note and 50t coin will circulate alongside existing designs for many years to come.",Business,Trust,"James Marape, Julius Chan, Justin Tkatchenko, Michael Somare, Sir Julius Chan",The National

Government still resisting push for decentralisation of powers: Minister,https://www.thenational.com.pg/government-still-resisting-push-for-decentralisation-of-powers-minister/,29/08/2025,"THE Government continues to control funding and decision-making from Waigani, despite its intention for decentralisation, an official says. Local Level Government and Provincial Affairs Minister Soroe Eoe said the key issue is to do with the centralisation of powers, despite three prior proposals for decentralisation. “Provinces remain dependent on national MPs and on district (DSIP) and provincial service improvement programmes (PSIP) funding mechanism, undermining the independence of local governments,” he said. He said this at the 2025 provincial administrators’ conference yesterday in Port Moresby. The dialogue among all administrators was for greater power and functions transfer to the provinces in a bid to accelerate improved service delivery to the people. Eoe referenced three proposed organic laws: “This assessment provides a new task for a newlook provincial government system that aligns with national priorities and aspirations, so for now, where have we gone wrong and where do we want to be in the next 50 years?” Eoe said “Performing the 1995 organic law is critical for governance and development because the current system has significant weaknesses that hinder effective service delivery and accountability. “The proposed reform aimed to rebalance physical power and grant provinces physical autonomy to govern themselves “There is overlap and confusion in service delivery, with the creation of the district development authority Act. This has caused overlapping roles and confusion between national, province and local level governments, thus leading to inefficiencies and wasted resources,” he said. “Proposed reforms seek to clarify responsibilities and streamline government structures and change in development demands. “The population has grown rapidly and development challenges have become increasingly complex and the current organic law is inadequate to these modern realities. “Proposed reforms aim to empower provinces to grow their economies and meet the demands of development. “The reforms aren’t simply about shifting the powers on pages, we are about creating a culture of responsibility and shared leadership.” He said decentralisation was the way forward to empower provinces to grow their own economies, strengthen their institutions and build resilient communities.",Politics,Frustration,Nill,The National

During a recent inspection of building materials in Port Moresby for four major infrastructure projects in the district, Amuli, the district development authority (DDA), of which he is chairman, would support them with K3.5 million. The building materials inspected were for the Kokoda High School four-in-one double classroom and administration office (K1 million), Kokoda Police Barracks and ablution block (K1 million), Magurie community health aid post (K500,000) and solar lights under the Sohe rural housing scheme (K1 million). Following the inspection, the payments would be made to the suppliers to prepare for the shipment of the materials to Oro Bay in Northern, and then onward to the respective project sites for construction. Amuli said that he was satisfied with the progress and reaffirmed his administration’s commitment of the projects with the use of the district services improvement programme (DSIP) funds of the DDA. “While the need for service delivery in Sohe is huge, the resources available to Government are limited,” he said. “The little DSIP funds we receive from the Government must be put to effective use to deliver maximum benefit for our people. “Sohe DDA is ensuring that every Kina is spent wisely to achieve value for money. “Our priority focus remains on critical services – schools, health, roads, and law and order – to improve the quality of life for our constituents.” Acting district chief executive officer Albert Bogembo commended the DDA board for approving the crucial infrastructure projects and assured that the administration team would have them completed.",Development,Trust,Henry Amuli,The National
Training aims to help communities prevent violence,https://www.thenational.com.pg/training-aims-to-help-communities-prevent-violence/,29/08/2025,"THE Madang Archdiocese has taken a step in the fight against gender-based violence (GBV) and sorcery accusation-related violence (Sarv) by hosting a week-long workshop aimed at empowering local communities. Held at the Migiar Pastoral Centre, the event brought together nearly 50 representatives from Catholic parishes, alongside with members of the Foursquare church, village court magistrates and the community policing unit. A statement from the Melanesian Institute said the initiative, a collaboration between the archdiocese, its development arm Diocesan Caritas, and the Grassroots Community Advocacy (GCA) Sumkar team, provided a forum for participants to share experiences and discuss strategies on how to prevent violence. Attendees from the districts of Madang, Bogia, Sumkar and Usino-Bundi engaged in dynamic discussions, focusing on how to de-escalate conflicts before they turned violent. A key theme of the workshop was the integration of faith-based principles into conflict resolution. Participants were encouraged to prioritise spiritual values over emotional responses during family disputes, fostering a collective dedication to ensuring respect and safety for everyone in the community. The sessions were facilitated by the the Grassroots Community Advocacy, with support from the Centre of Hope Safe House and the Melanesian Institute. The workshop equipped attendees with practical knowledge and tools to take back to their communities and implement change. Organisers recognised Father Eugene Grengary, Sr Techla, and Leo Yat for their leadership. The collaborative effort highlighted a unified commitment to combating violence and promoting a culture of respect and safety throughout Madang.",Community,Trust,Nill,The National
Miss Western contestant seeking sponsors,https://www.thenational.com.pg/miss-western-contestant-seeking-sponsors/,29/08/2025,"A CONTESTANT of the Miss Bird of Paradise Western Pageant is seeking sponsorship to register for the pageant which will be held early next month. Sophie Yasa, 23, from Western, Gulf and Eastern Highlands, was selected to contest amongst nine other contestants for the title of Miss Western. The event will be held on Sept 6 in Daru. Campaign manager James Mapo said since the shortlist came out last month, his team was yet to put in a registration of K5,000. “So far, we have sent letters to business houses in Daru, but we are still waiting for their responses,” Mapo said. “We have less than two weeks before the contest.” So far, the owner of a local business called A&A consultants, Theresa Aia, had stepped in to help cover for the wardrobe and makeup for Yasa. Yasa, in her appeal, said she was born and raised in Daru, and it was education that brought her out to Port Moresby in 2022. “Joining a beauty pageant is not all about beauty or having some talent. “For me, it’s about using the platform to help address social issues that I have witnessed my whole life growing up on the island and in Western,” she said. “This is an opportunity for me to be a role model for other women in the province who are suppressed every day by social issues and culture norms also. We want people to see change in different views and one is through such events. “We are also encouraging tourism by promoting our culture and traditions, having the largest land mass and having a lot of great sites for tourists to visit,” Yasa said.",Culture,Anticipation,Nill,The National

A life in three worlds. Andrew records experience in memoir,https://www.thenational.com.pg/a-life-in-three-worlds-andrew-records-experience-in-memoir/,29/08/2025,"WHILE there are no official records, Andrew Menger Marubu believes that he was born in 1958, at Sol in the upper Mendi Valley. His father, Marubu Pon Mondo, had three wives and Andrew was the third born, and only son, of his second wife, Pim Payim Porom. He is one of a decreasing number of people who have experienced the ‘three worlds’ that have created modern Papua New Guinea. He has experienced traditional life, life during the Australian administration and life since Independence. He has undertaken the extremely difficult and time-consuming task of recording his experiences of living during this historic time in a draft personal memoir. There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity for those who have lived through this historic period to record their experiences and observations. During his career, Andrew has worked in many parts of Papua New Guinea in a range of strategic roles. His work has also taken him to Russia, China, Thailand, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Western Samoa, Australia, New Zealand and even to the tiny isolated Pacific island of Niue. He explained that his parents would have rarely ventured beyond sight of the place where they were born, before the Australian Administration stopped tribal fighting in the Mendi Valley. Andrew’s wife is a nurse from the Eastern Highlands and the occupations and lives of their children – a lawyer and running her own law firm, a printer, a PNG Power worker, a nurse, a policeman and a medical student – would generally be quite unfamiliar to their grandparents. The people and governments of most nations have had centuries to navigate the politics and technologies of a globalised world, which Papua New Guinea has had to achieve in little more than one generation! Andrew has written of his experiences and observations of Papua New Guinea negotiating its place in the world over the past 50 years; a valuable record of successes and failures to inform future decision-making. He also describes the experiences and observations of the first 17 years of his life during the Australian Administration; especially his interactions with teachers, medical staff and missionaries. Finally, he identifies and explains valuable traditional models used in crisis management, conflict resolution, environmental management, and in community cooperation and regeneration that could be adapted to help address some current and future issues. Andrew highlights effective traditional knowledges used in agricultural, architectural and art practices, developed over centuries or millennia that should be celebrated and not forgotten. Those ideas align with a statement made by Sir Michael Somare in 1975, on the eve of Independence: Every nation must build its identity and future on the strengths of its own past. A nation’s strength is its past. A people’s successful future lies in pride in their past. Traditional life Andrew’s memoir includes detailed descriptions of the traditional lives of his parents and ancestors. While there was constant potential for tribal fighting, Andrew also describesSai haundanMok inkceremonies that contributed to cohesion within a group and also reaffirmed friendships with allies.Sai haundbegan with community members cooperating to buildhauslainsfor future guests andMok inkended with a huge pig-kill where pork was distributed to friends. He also described trade fortigassotree oil – used in singsings – with Foi people around Lake Kutubu and for salt obtained from Enga people near Surunki. Life during the Australian Administration The first Australian that Andrew came into contact with was a nurse at Mendi hospital following an accident. He was impaled on a stick that had an empty round meat tin nailed to it, to create a toy ‘truck’, when it hit a tree-root. Momei Pangial, the first president of the Upper Mendi Local Government Council, persuaded his parents to take him to Mendi hospital. In his very early teens, Momei had attached himself to a patrol and worked his way from assistant cook to eventually representing the people of Mendi in National Parliament. He was able to clearly present the objectives of the Australian Administration to his people, including the power of Western medicine and health care. Andrew suggests that for most villagers, the ability to safely travel as the result of stopping tribal fighting by the Australian Administration had the greatest immediate impact on their lives. Other influences included western medicines and health-care, standardised education and legal systems, the cash economy, and the introduction of Christianity. For the nation as a whole, the introduction of democratic government on three levels – local, provincial and national – and management models were important legacies. Andrew attended Bela Primary T’ School from 1964 and entered Mendi High School in 1971. He was an active member of the Mendi High School cultural activities group. A part of the programme included examining traditional activities such asTie Nolor ‘cassowary race’ that avoided open warfare andTimpceremonies where, after around a generation, all economic, social and spiritual debts were repaid and communities could have a new beginning free of ongoing discontent. The programme also included collaborating with villagers to construct a museum where aspects of the different cultures in the Southern Highlands could be displayed and discussed. The museum was modelled on the largest traditional building in the Mendi Valley – aPolunda –that in turn was an interpretation of a Foi (Lake Kutubu) men’s longhouse. It was supported by six huge posts that had to be extracted from surrounding mountain forests. Life since Independence After graduating from Mendi High School, Andrew attended Sogeri National High School. He entered the University of Papua New Guinea in 1977 and graduated with a degree in social work. That university course had a great influence on decisions and values over his lifetime. In 1980, he entered the public service with the Office of Information that took him to East Sepik and to Eastern Highlands, where he met his wife, Dorothy (nee Kasive), a nurse from Asaro. Next, Andrew was transferred to Daru to serve under the Department of Western Province where he reached the level of assistant secretary. This was followed by a position with the Department of Housing and Urbanisation in Port Moresby. He has also been first secretary to the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and an advisor to provincial governors and members of parliament, including: The Governor for Southern Highlands; the Governor for Western; the Member for Kavieng and Minister for Defence; Member for Kandrian-Gloucester and Minister for Forests; and Member for South Fly and Minister for Sports. Memoirs such as Andrew’s, especially if well illustrated with contemporary photographs of the people, places and events that are discussed, will be extremely valuable historical records for future generations. They would complement Sir Albert Maori Kiki’s 1968 classic:‘Ten Thousand Years in a Lifetime’. If Andrew’s memoir can be edited and published it would serve as a key model for others to follow.",History,Trust,Michael Somare,The National
Bishop Urame calls for real repentance,https://www.thenational.com.pg/bishop-urame-calls-for-real-repentance/,28/08/2025,"A CHURCH leader says that it is a mockery to call for repentance without “genuine repentance”. PNG Evangelical Lutheran Church Head Bishop Dr Jack Urame, reflecting on Repentance Day celebrated annually on Aug 26 since 2007, said there had never been any genuine repentance. “PNG has been celebrating the event annually for the past 18 years, yet the reality of the brokenness of our society does not show that there is genuine repentance,” he said. “Repentance by words without actions is a deception of our claim as a Christian country and a denial of our Christian duty.” Urame supported the call by churches for “repentance, reconciliation and to reset the future of the nation”. “We can’t ignore or deny the brokenness which appears in different forms. “Issues of lack of basic services, law and order breakdown, unemployment, youth disorientation, drug, violence, lack of good health care, economic inequality and social injustice are signs of brokenness and suffering confronting our people. “National repentance day provides the time for us to reflect, change, heal and transform our nation. “Without genuine repentance, healing and restoration and future of our nation is not bright and promising.” He said prayer alone could not heal the country’s “brokenness” nor solve corruption, weak governance and ineffective management of the affairs of the country. “Prayer must go together with genuine repentance and real action to mend the brokenness of our nation, from our homes up to the high government offices,” he said. He said the political leaders must lead by example by providing honest leadership. “The Government is entrusted with the responsibility of care to mend the brokenness, heal our nation and give hope,” he added. “The future we want, after 50 years of our political journey, is one with social stability, economic progress, development progress, peace, justice, unity and harmony.”",Politics,Sadness,Nill,The National
"In strife-torn Enga, Kunalin tribe embraces peace",https://www.thenational.com.pg/in-strife-torn-enga-kunalin-tribe-embraces-peace/,28/08/2025,"IN strife-torn Enga province, the Kunalin clan at Sirunki has shown restraint worthy of praise and notice. Situated atop Sirunki where the river Lai has its headwaters – flowing south into the Gulf of Papua and north to the mighty Sepik and onto the Bismarch Sea – the Kunalin opted to throw away violence into the Lai and embrace peace. It did so last Thursday in the face of great aggression and intimidation from a neighboring Laiagam tribe. The tribe invaded Kunalin land, set fire to 13 houses, slaughtered pigs and cut down trees before withdrawing. All through this, Kunalin tribesmen watched from a distance, without a word or action raised in anger or retaliation. The Kunalin tribe live on the border of Enga’s Wabag and Laiagam districts. Their restraint has earned the praise of Jude Tukuliya, the managing director of Conservation and Environment Protection Authority (Cepa), who is from Sirunki. Tukuliya said such a gesture was unusual in Engan culture and particularly in one such as Kunalin, known for its violence and warrior spirit in recent times. It was a true testament to the people’s desire to turn away from violence and embrace peace, he said. The Kunalin from Sirunki station came together with six other tribes in the LLG, including Lakolam tribe from Wabag to launch the community peace programme on the National Repentance Day in Sirunki. The Kunalin clan was attacked on a wrong impression that the clan was responsible for the killing of a man from Laiagam. It was later confirmed that the deceased was being pursued by his enemy from Laiagam into Sirunki and murdered. Tukuliya said the Kunalin wanted to change the image of the region from ‘wild west’ to ‘peaceful west.’ He also acknowledged CARE International for preparing the community well in the last five months, conducting trainings, doing peace advocacy, and identifying livelihood projects for the communities to take on to sustain peace. Other speakers on the occasion, Nelson Leia, the provincial law and order director, with representatives from the provincial government, and Nathan Luso with Rodney Watanikam from Jacob Luke Charitable Foundation and Lyumban Foundation said it was about time clans from all parts of Enga learn to “turn the other cheek”. Sirunki LLG interim president Douglas Tamarua Sirunki, who is from Kunalin, said Sirunki was the gateway to west Enga; Laigam, Kandep and Porgera-Paiela districts, known for tribal fights. If the gateway could shut the door to violence and open it to peace, it was hoped that the same could be embraced by all throughout the west. Youths surrendered home-brewing equipment and marijuana, old and young with their leaders marched in solidarity with the conviction of establishing lasting peace in Sirunki and beyond. Michael Daniels, chairman of Sirunki Peace Foundation Advocacy Society and deputy principal of Sirunki Secondary School said the Kunalin and the rest of the tribes are ready to embrace and promote peace.",Society,Trust,Nill,The National

The districts affected are Wapenamanda, Lagaip, Porgera-Paiela, Kandep and Kompiam-Ambum. They will include an alcohol ban, restrictions on the movement of people and public gatherings. The three months began from last Thursday. “The declarations are necessary as the provincial government seeks to invoke emergency powers to enable government agencies to control the recent escalation in tribal conflicts and warfare posing serious and imminent public safety risks to our people and also impacting delivery and access to public services across the province,” he said. Tsaka said the declaration would enable government agencies to invoke emergency powers to restrict movement, conduct arbitrary checks, detain suspects, confiscate properties, enforce curfews and other emergency measures to address security threats and restore the rule of law. “An automatic liquor ban comes into effect in all declared fighting zone areas and the Liquor Commissioner and Commission are required to advise all authorised licenced premises of this ban,” he said. “The law enforcement agencies are to work with the commission to enforce the ban.” Tsaka said the movement of people and vehicles in and out of the declared fighting zones would be restricted to ensure public safety. “Public gatherings and assemblies in any public areas within the declared zones will be strictly restricted too,” he said. Tsaka said that all declared areas would undergo random searches and inspection by law enforcement agencies. “Individuals found carrying prohibited items or suspected of illegal activities will be subject to arrest, detainment and appropriate criminal charges would be laid and prosecuted,” he said.",Politics,Fear,Nill,The National
Political party rep says government has not paid them,https://www.thenational.com.pg/political-party-rep-says-government-has-not-paid-them/,28/08/2025,"A POLITICAL party general secretary has called on the Registrar of Political Parties to pay registered party executives gratuities as was the practice before.

The Pangu Party general secretray raised the issue of gratuities and the late payment of funds to political parties on behalf of all party executives during the disbursement of government grants to political parties on Monday.

Assistant police commissioner (National Capital District and Central) Benjamin Turi said anyone destroying buildings or recklessly damaging the vehicles would be dealt with. He said the vehicles were for the people to benefit from and not police officers. “The building itself, I came for inspection a month ago, we’re happy to have a local contractor do the renovations. It will support the prisoners instead of taking them all the way up to Sogeri,” he said. “These vehicles will not be tinted. Take care of them and no drinking and driving.” Turi said the incident scene at Barakau last month where a police vehicle crashed into a construction truck was not a good look when he did inspections. He also said they might need a prisoners’ van for easier transportation from 15-Mile to the court house. “To the public, you are our eyes. “If you see any misuse like carrying families in these vehicles take the number and video or pictures and report it to us.” MP Keith Iduhu said the police station renovation cost around K380,000 to serve people of 15-Mile, lower Sogeri and Hiri East. Iduhu said the areas required logistical support and was for this reason the district had arranged the delivery of two new vehicles. “We commit these vehicles into your care to support the policing needs of our community. “We trust that you will take care and maintain the good conditions of the building with pride and discipline,” he said. “Let us all commit ourselves to being better citizens and more effective public servants.

"Court dismisses motion, rules in favour of Dr Ambi",https://www.thenational.com.pg/court-dismisses-motion-rules-in-favour-of-dr-ambi/,28/08/2025,"A COURT has dismissed a motion filed by Health Minister Elias Kapavore and Social Change and Mental Health Services (SCMHS) director Dr Nelson Mek seeking to dismiss Dr Umadevi Ambihaipahar’s proceeding for being an abuse of process. National Court judge Susan Purdon-Sully yesterday dismissed the notice of motion as the defendants had failed to rely on a specific provision for summary dismissal provided for in Order 16, a provision sufficient to address their complaint. The court heard that in 2017 Ambihaipahar (better known as Dr Uma or Dr Ambi) was appointed acting director of SCMHS by the then-health minister. On Jan 15, she was served a letter of suspension dated Jan 8 by Kapavore. She filed a judicial review proceedings styled OS (JR) No 5 of 2025 on Feb 10 seeking leave to review the decision of her suspension. On March 4, Kapavore served the plaintiff with a notice of revocation of her appointment and appointed Mek as the director, which was gazetted on Jan 29. The plaintiff withdrew her proceedings on April 3 and filed a fresh proceeding on April 28, seeking leave to review the decision to revoke her appointment. Leave was granted and Mek was added as a party to the proceedings. Kapavore and Mek filed the motion on June 10 to dismiss the plaintiff’s proceedings, arguing that it was incompetent and an abuse of process as she had failed to disclose a reasonable cause for action. The plaintiff raised grounds on competency and argued that the defendants relied on an incorrect jurisdictional basis for order for summary dismissal of the judicial review proceedings which renders the motion’s nullity. The court upheld the plaintiff’s objection as the defendants had invoked the same jurisdictional power in the National Court Rules, deeming an abuse of process.

China brings gifts for veterans,https://www.thenational.com.pg/china-brings-gifts-for-veterans/,28/08/2025,"VETERANS of the Pacific Islands Regiment league on Monday were presented two flags, 200 ties and other items by the Chinese Embassy. The league led by president and retired Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) commander Jerry Singirok was established in May as a voice for soldiers from the First and Second battalion and veterans who have served in the regiment. Defence Attaché Senior Col Jiang Tuan said it was a pleasure to show respect to the new veteran’s league of the PNGDF. “We want to keep this good relation not only for the economic areas but also between the two forces and also between the two branches of veterans,” Tuan said. Singirok thanked China’s people’s liberation army for the gifts and said between 1995 and 1996, as commander, he sent the first lot of officers to China for short terms courses hoping that they would build a relationship on the basis that our Government has declared that Papua New Guinea is a friendly country and has no enermies. “This friendship is to the extent that we’d like to study the model in China because veterans in China came to PNG to see conditions and opportunities here in PNG and wed like this association to foster that relationship but more importantly look at the welfare of the veterans,” Singirok said. Other veterans at the event included Brig Gen Francis Agwi, Col Michael Daniels, Maj George Morris, Maj Moses Jenjet and Warrant Officer Chris Mora. Singirok said the veterans cover the first regiment at Taurama and the second regiment in Moem Barracks that was established in 1965 and this has been 60 years in existence with more than 3,000 members. He toldThe Nationalthat the league would be the mouthpiece for Veterans Affairs and for current members who cannot speak openly on matters of operations and administration for the Defence Force. “We hope the government will recognise the faithful work of the soldiers and honour them accordingly,” he said. He added the regiment traces its roots to the Papuan Infantry Battalion and the New Guinea Infantry Battalion — two heroic units during the Southwest Pacific Campaign World War II. “Since then the regiment has stood as the foundation of the PNGDF since 1951 and has served with honour across the region,” Singirok said.",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National

Solar power saves college’s poultry project,https://www.thenational.com.pg/solar-power-saves-colleges-poultry-project/,28/08/2025,"THE self-sustained Christian Leaders’ Training College (CLTC) in Banz, Jiwaka, has owed Bank South Pacific Financial Group Limited K3.2 million from its poultry project since 2020. However, CLTC has recently commissioned a K1.4 million solar-generated electricity unit that would help to keep the poultry project and other income-generating projects operating to make money for the repayment of the debt. The solar power will also provide constant electricity for the learning institution. CLTC principal Dr Maxon Mani said the poultry project, which generated much money for the college was affected during the Coronavirus period, creating the huge debt which the college was now repaying. Mani said the poultry project, which chicken and chicks to the Highlands, was managed by Tablebirds from 2015-2019, and when that company left, Signature Poultry took over in 2020. However, Mani said Signature Poultry left during the Covid-19 period after the business was making a loss, resulting in the debt of K3.2 million. He said as a Christian organisation, CLTC took on the debt quietly, and was now repaying the loan. “We are slowly reviving the poultry project, selling 80 boxes of chicks per week. “Also, we are now selling 5,000 meat birds per week. Previously, we used to sell 180,000 –  200,000 birds in a week,” he said. He said CLTC did not have the capacity to rebuild the project to its full potential, however, an application had been put to the Department of Livestock and Agriculture for support to maximise production. He said egg production was being revitalised to meet the market demand. Commenting on the solar power project, Mani said: “Electricity supply is integrated into solar power, PNG Power supply, and generator set, whereby one electricity source is switched off, the other electricity is automatically connected and switched on. “The solar system uses 1,000 solar panels to charge the batteries, producing 700 kilowatts of energy per day.” He said the solar system was funded by New Zealand and Australian benefactors while the solar panels, batteries and accessories were bought in from Germany.",Business,Trust,Nill,The National
Training centre celebrates 61st anniversary,https://www.thenational.com.pg/training-centre-celebrates-61st-anniversary/,28/08/2025,"THE Christian Leaders’ Training College (CLTC) in Banz, Jiwaka, celebrated its 61st anniversary last week as a lead-up to the 50th Independence anniversary celebrations. Attended by few of the 2,000 alumnae who passed out from the centre since 1964, staff, students and the surrounding communities, the celebration was marked with a thanksgiving programme to God for His faithfulness in building leadership in the churches in the South Pacific. CLTC principal Dr Maxon Mani said the college with its two campuses in Lae and Port Moresby, was accredited by the Commission of Higher Education in 2010, with the first graduation for the Masters in Theology programme held in 2012. Mani said CLTC was looking forward to offering doctorate programme in bible and theology by 2030. He said a submission was made to the Department of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology three years ago, which was pending approval. The college had the capacity, and was placing the academic staff on doctorate programmes to qualify them for teaching as part of the preparatory stages, he said. Mani said master’s programme was offered in 2008 and degree in1979, five years after the college was incorporated as a national institution. Mani said the Evangelical Alliance Churches, Pentecostal and the mainline churches had their pastoral leaders trained in CLTC to serve the church, Government and community. He said there were three strands of study programmes — agriculture, technical trades, and bible and theology. But in 1995, agriculture and technical skills programmes were taken out because government schools were providing them. “However, we have seen the need to take on agriculture and technical trades, as we see more students coming out from Grade 12,” Mani said. He said apart from the bible and theology programmes, CLTC streamlined community transformation integrated programmes which included scripture study, farming, and business studies five years back.",Education,Trust,Nill,The National

Prime Minister James Marape reminded everyone of what Sir Michael had declared in 1975, that no human wisdom could hold together the country’s thousand tribes and 800 languages without being anchored in God. “Sir Michael told us that no human wisdom can hold this land together,” Marape said. “He said this nation must be anchored in God, and God alone. “Today, standing at the threshold of our 50th year, I see the deep wisdom in his words.” The atmosphere at the stadium was filled with words of praise and worship songs by Christians of all denominations. There were live band performances by the gospel band P2UIF and African gospel singer Sinach. Marape urged all Papua New Guineans to seek forgiveness and reconciliation, and rededicate the nation to God. He also requested the people to forgive him for a “curse” he made during the 2019 Repentance Day, that corruption and those who practised it were holding Papua New Guinea back. He said yesterday that it was intended only for the corrupt public servants and politicians. “I remove the curse I made seven years ago as it is not for the nation, and I ask for forgiveness,” he said. “Repentance must go beyond words and be reflected in a real transformation of character. “Repentance is not lip service. “It must be anchored in true transformation – in our hearts, our families, our communities, and in the highest offices of this land.” Marape also held himself accountable. “If I, as your Prime Minister, am a stumbling block to our nation’s progress, I ask God to remove me and raise up someone better to lead Papua New Guinea,” he said.",Religion,Trust,"James Marape, Michael Somare",The National
Seven warring Wabag tribes reconcile,https://www.thenational.com.pg/seven-warring-wabag-tribes-reconcile/,27/08/2025,"SEVEN warring tribes in Lagaip and at the western end of Wabag districts in Enga came together for a peace ceremony at the Surinki government station on Repentance Day yesterday. It came as tribal fights were reported in Mulitaka and Wapenamanda, and Mt Hagen in Western Highlands. The seven tribes, who sporadically attacked each other, sought forgiveness, and vowed not to take up arms for conflict resolutions. They instead elected to support family building through viable self-sustained projects, and build a peaceful Enga. Men, women and children from Lakolam, Aiyokolam, Leprapus, Apanda, Sirunki station, Kaipale, and Lyamala, marched into the station for the event organised by Care International in PNG and its partners, the Sirunki Peace Advocacy Society, the Surinki Peace Committee and churches. The initiative is a peace-building and livelihood support project to support changes in the western districts of Wabag and Lagaip, promoting a new identity grounded in peace, unity and community resilience. The project is supported by the Minderoo Foundation in Australia through Care International. Surinki local level government president Douglas Tamarua said the western end of Enga must promote peace. He said members of his Kuualin tribe demonstrated that by not retaliating against a tribe from Laigap which attacked them just two days before Repentance Day. Sirunki peace committee member Michael Danus said: “The people of Sirunki and Western Enga want change. We believe that through faith and collaborative efforts, we can restore the glory days of our land.” Care International in a statement said a training had empowered the people to identify the root causes of conflict and to develop their own solutions.

This means that something is very wrong with the country. “We really need good leadership to take the bull by the horn and deal with corruption which is destroying our country.” Namani told the 2025 PNG Update seminar last week that the systems to address corruption were already in place but strong leadership was lacking. He said that institutions such as the Ombudsman Commission, Auditor-General and the judiciary, needed to be empowered to hold those who practised corruption accountable. “These institutions need to be empowered and protected from any outside interference,” he said. “We have the laws in place to allow them to operate but there has been a low rate of prosecution of about 20 per cent in the country. That is unacceptable.” He added that adherence to the Constitution would not only address corrupt practices but also allow for greater socio-economic development of the country. He said: “The Constitution was born out of careful thought and we shouldn’t change it. Among other things, the Constitution also allows for economic development. Papua New Guinea is blessed with so many natural resources yet we cannot translate these blessings into economic development for the people.

Airline board chairman Karl Yalo said Seddon was suspended so that they could look into information on spare parts and other administrative issues. Seddon’s suspension came before the airline received its first Airbus A220 on Sept 15. Tomuriesa asked why should somebody come and do the hard work, use his wisdom to bring these planes into the country, and then somebody else comes and takes the credit? “I think this is nonsense,” he said. He urged the Government to look into this and act quickly as this was not in the public’s interest.

Political parties cautioned to comply with financial returns,https://www.thenational.com.pg/political-parties-cautioned-to-comply-with-financial-returns/,27/08/2025,"POLITICAL party executives have been cautioned to comply with financial returns or face grants being forfeited to the government. Registrar of Political Parties Emmanuel Pok said this when paying K3.4 million to 16 political parties with MP representatives for administrative use. Each registered party is expected to acquit an election report, due three months after an election, and the annual report due each year on March 31. Pok, referring to Section 88 of the Organic Law on Integral Political Parties and Candidates (OLIPPAC), said party executives who do not comply will be guilty of misconduct in office under the leadership code and will be referred to the Ombudsman Commission. The payment on Monday is state funding for 2023 and 2024. Each party will be paid K10,000 for each MP. “Though we face delayed funding situations, when the state pays, it backdates and pays in full. “As of today (Monday), the State does not owe any funds to political parties. “It is now for the executives to ensure they comply with the commission with their acquittals or they face penalties,” he said. Since 2001, when the OLIPPAC was introduced, the state invested over K85 million over the last 24 years. This includes fortnightly salaries and monthly stipends for political party executives. “If there is no reasonable justification for two consecutive years, party registrations will be cancelled,” he said. The commission has expended a sum of over K1 million in political party funding and K1 million in stipends for presidents and treasurers of political parties. From the K3.4 million paid by the State, over K3 million has been disbursed to the 16 political parties.

National Research Institute Professor research fellow Dr Thomas Webster told the 2025 PNG Update seminar last week that MPs had a responsibility for the development of the nation and not just of their own people. “People have developed a mind-set that MPs are meant to deliver on their needs and requests such as fixing infrastructure or paying for funeral expenses,” he said. “The focus of many MPs now is to secure funds for their electorates and provinces. “It is not about national issues or how best they can address them but about their electorate and how they are able to secure their funds.” Webster urged all MPs to understand the primary roles as legislators in Parliament, which was the representation of the country’s legislative arm of government. He said that MPs, through Parliament and parliamentary committees, needed to hold the executive government accountable to the people. “MPs, even though they have been elected by their people to be represented in Parliament, must make decisions in the best interest of the nation,” he said. “Parliament makes laws and elect the executive government and ensures accountability of the executive government. “Parliamentary committees, which are also empowered by the Constitution, must also be strengthened to provide oversight over the executive government. “These roles have been lacking as there has been a decline in the ability of Parliament to hold the executive government accountable.” Webster added that Papua New Guineans must also understand the roles and responsibilities of their elected leaders, stating that elections are one of the most important democratic processes for them. “People need to know about their role in the development of the country,” he said. “They are able to contribute through their elected leaders during elections every five years.",Politics,Trust,Nill,The National

Nomane said proper fiscal consolidation, a government policy aimed at reducing budget deficits and national debt by either cutting spending or increasing revenue to improve fiscal sustainability and investor confidence, was still left wanting ever since Prime Minister James Marape took office in 2019. “On the eve of Papua New Guinea’s 50th Independence anniversary, the 2025 national budget is on the brink of failing because of the Government’s failed fiscal consolidation,” he said in a statement on Monday. “After six years, we continue to miss revenue targets, and the prime minister is unable to make the tough decision to cut spending on Connect PNG and the public service. The latter takes up 33 per cent of the budget and crowds out development priorities. “From the 5.6 per cent legislated fund for Connect PNG programme, more than K8.5 billion has been spent on road infrastructure without any audits in the last six years. “This lack of transparency and governance is synonymous with crony capitalism and parochial politics.” Nomane said if the Government was focused on decreasing expenditure, the country would have stabilised debt, curbed inflation, reduced deficit, and created fiscal space for investments. “The Government defends itself by saying its borrowing is within the ambit of the Fiscal Responsibility Act and brags about a sustainable debt-to-GDP ratio of 52 per cent. “The sad reality is that gross domestic product (GDP) is artificially high because inflation is high, and the Kina is in depreciation. “GDP is not high because of high economic output,” Nomane said. “The current situation is that failed revenue has led to cash shortages, increasing arrears and putting pressure on debt repayments, and those districts that received only K3 million out of K20 million in 2025 will not receive 100 per cent appropriation. “The 2025 Budget will fail without an immediate supplementary budget to correct this budget blowout.

Wasi making busking known in Wewak,https://www.thenational.com.pg/wasi-making-busking-known-in-wewak/,27/08/2025,"STREET preachers speaking to passersby are common in Port Moresby and Wewak, East Sepik, among other centres. Musicians who busk, or perform on streets, are rare. You will find one or two at Boroko in Port Moresby. Musicians who busk on the streets or beside shopping malls are common in towns and cities in the western world. In Wewak, there is one musician who is bringing this rare practice to the sea-side town. Leo Wasi can be found busking beside the QP Trading shop, opposite the Tang Mow Plaza and hotel car park. The artiste, with his acoustic guitar, will be seen most days of the week, donned in white and sporting a nice hat as well. His favourite numbers are the golden oldies. He also sings with an accent that is more foreign than local. “I come here almost every day,” Wasi said. “I also do tutorials for those who want to play the guitar.” Wasi said he charges his students K25 for two-three hours. “I have roots in Chambri here in East Sepik, but I came from Lae, in Morobe,” he said. “I am here for a while. I do not know how long I will be staying.” In the meantime, the show goes on.",Culture,Trust,Nill,The National
‘We were the youths of Independence’: Max Hufanen Rai recalls how student activism helped drive PNG’s push for nationhood,https://www.thenational.com.pg/we-were-the-youths-of-independence-max-hufanen-rai-recalls-how-student-activism-helped-drive-pngs-push-for-nationhood/,27/08/2025,"IN the final years before independence, the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) was more than an academic institution – it was a political engine. Student leaders debated, campaigned, and confronted the doubts of a divided country. Max Rai was one of them. “I was one of the student leaders who always spoke pro-independence,” he said. “Because I was very close to the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, I would stand up and argue against anyone who opposed independence.” Rai entered UPNG in 1974 after completing Form Four at Brandi High School. He was part of a cohort of Sepik students who had come through one of the country’s top secondary schools at that time. “Preliminary year is like combining Form Five and Form Six,” he said. “After that, I did a degree for three years.” But it wasn’t the academic structure that defined his time – it was the political climate. Rai became student president of the Pangu Pati branch and a regular speaker at the university forum. “Sometimes I chaired meetings. Other times, anything said about Somare or Pangu Pati, I would stand up against other people.” The forums were held at lunchtime, open to students and lecturers alike. “When there were elections, we would have forums,” Rai said. “I would be chairing the meeting promoting Pangu Pati. And I travelled around the country campaigning – in Madang, in Rabaul, and different places.” But not everyone was convinced that gaining independence was the right way to go. At least not yet. “Many in the Highlands thought they weren’t ready,” Rai said. “But we said: Let’s get independence and worry about your problems later. We told them the Australians weren’t going to build roads in the highlands. We have to become independent, find our own money, and build our own bridges and roads. “But the Australians supported our move for Independence and that made a big difference.” Rai said the Sepik students were especially vocal. “We were ready. Definitely,” he said. “Even though we had similar infrastructure problems, our councils were already building roads. “Most of the roads in our province were built by councils – not the national government.” The forums at the university weren’t just talk. They shaped public opinion. “We were promoting independence all the time,” Rai said. Rai’s connection to Sir Michael ran deep. His sister’s husband had worked with Sir Michael atRadio Wewak, and Rai had known him since he was young. “Those people who said negative things about Somare, I would stand up and confront them and then I would go and report all that to him,” he said. Sometimes, while Rai was in UPNG, Sir Michael would send for him directly. The UPNG administration at the time encouraged student involvement in the lead-up to independence. “They encouraged us to take part in independence – a historic event that would transform everything in PNG, including the university,” Rai said. “Some people did not because they were scared that something might happen. But nothing happened. “We celebrated independence (with) no problems.” On September 16, 1975, Rai and fellow student Gabriel Dusava attended the flag-raising ceremony at Sir Hubert Murray Stadium. “People arrived so early. The place was packed,” he said. “When Gabriel and I caught a bus and arrived, they said: ‘Place is full. Wait outside.’ So we had to stay on the roadside and watch the flag go up.” Rai remembers the moment vividly. “The Australian flag came down for the very last time,” he said. “A lot of people were crying. They were sorry that the Australians were leaving. Not necessarily overnight. The flag coming down meant that they were going to eventually leave. And our flag went up, and it’s been up there all these years.” Rai felt pride – not just in the country, but also in the role students had played. “We were the youths of independence. We pushed for it. We believed in it. And now we were seeing it happen,” he said. “In the early days, we had to nurture the country. You didn’t have to graduate from an Australian university to come and do miraculous things. You have to graduate from your own country and go through the experience.” During his time at UPNG, Rai also led demonstrations against government decisions he believed weren’t in the nation’s interest. “If you don’t agree with the government, you must,” he said. “We led many demonstrations. Not violent. But we made an impact.” Sir Michael knew Rai was involved. “He would tell the people to come and tell me to go up and talk to him,” he said. “I’d go up and brief him and say, we’re demonstrating for the public. We must make an impact for public support.” Rai believes student power was essential in those years. “Often the opposition parties were not very active,” he said. “In politics, you trade positions. Sometimes, some things that were not good for the country – you need student power to force the government to change.” Rai said the forums were the backbone of that movement. “Almost every day at the university forum, if we thought that something was not in the nation’s interest in the long run, we would debate.” After graduation, Rai joined the Department of Foreign Affairs and later studied at the Australian National University. But even outside of UPNG, he still did all he could for the country that he and many others of his generation were nurturing. He went on to be a United Nation’s diplomat and an ambassador to several countries, including China. He laid the ground work for Chinese investors to come to the country and for PNG students to study in China. Looking back, Rai credits Sir Michael’s cabinet strategy for PNG’s peaceful transition. “He put the right people in Cabinet to represent the whole country,” he said. “They went out and convinced everyone. That’s why we got independence without trouble.” Rai said he was proud of the country’s resilience since gaining independence. “There’s no country like PNG,” he said. “We have thousands of languages and yet our people still get along.” But he’s also clear-eyed about the risks and how fragile unity can be at times. “Any disintegration will be a disaster,” he said, adding that one province deciding to leave may lead to more pulling away. “At independence, many thought we’d fall apart, but we didn’t.” Rai said Sir Michael had always intended for provinces to gradually become autonomous so that the people would not have to rely on the Government or donors. “It came out in the Constitutional Planning Committee to ensure that it goes in the Constitution. That eventually, provinces should be autonomous to ensure that they take the lead in building their own provinces,” he said. Rai urges young Papua New Guineans to think nationally. “Don’t think about your province. Think PNG. Promote the country first, then your place of origin,” he said. Rai said in that way, everyone would be contributing to nation-building as it was everyone’s responsibility. “PNG will become a strong and powerful country. A competitor to Australia and New Zealand.” Rai is not just hopeful – he’s proud. “As somebody who was part of the youth of independence, I must say: I’m really proud of our country,” he said. “We’ve come a long way.”",Politics,Pride,Michael Somare,The National
Deadly infectious diseases on Australia’s doorstep,https://www.thenational.com.pg/deadly-infectious-diseases-on-australias-doorstep/,27/08/2025,"Adelaide: Australians have little knowledge of the threat on their doorstep from the world’s deadliest infectious diseases and it has a crucial role in fighting them, the head of a global health partnership says. Lady Ros Morauta, chair of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, is visiting Australia this week to lobby MPs to increase our contribution to its work. “These diseases are a huge threat to Australia,” she told AAP. “HIV, for example – there are heaps of Australians who go to PNG and to Fiji, and the increase in HIV in those two countries in the last couple of years is extraordinary.” The Global Fund’s Indo-Pacific regional impact report, released on Monday, exposes the urgent health emergencies on Australia’s doorstep. Papua New Guinea recorded 11,000 new HIV cases in 2024 and declared a national HIV crisis in June, while Fiji declared an HIV outbreak in January after almost 1,600 new infections last year. TB remains PNG’s leading cause of death, with its health minister declaring “a war” on TB in June. Lady Ros, who has lived in PNG for 43 years and was the nation’s first lady from 1999 to 2002, said Global Fund’s impact as a multilateral funder of global health grants had been “amazing”. Over the last two decades, the Global Fund partnership has saved 65 million lives and cut the combined death rate from AIDS, TB and malaria by 61 per cent, she said. “It’s the most fantastic organisation, because it’s very much country-led, country-focused and performance-driven. It’s not the donor saying, ‘oh, you should do this’, she said. Funding is based on a national plan put forward by the nation, and implemented by government agencies and the private sector. “If you say you’re going to distribute half a million mosquito nets, you have to distribute them for the next lot of money to come,” Lady Ros said. There were still huge health challenges in the region, and Australia should support its neighbours by tackling them, she added. Australia pledged AU$266 million (about K720m) for 2023-2025, and the fund is now seeking AU$330 million (about K893m) for its next funding cycle. “Australia has been a donor to the Global Fund from the very beginning – and it’s in Australia’s interest, as well as being the right thing to do,” Lady Ros said. Australia is expected to announce its next pledge to the fund in 2025. Source: AAP",Health,Fear,Nill,The National
Australia in the dark over China-Nauru development deal,https://www.thenational.com.pg/australia-in-the-dark-over-china-nauru-development-deal/,27/08/2025,"Canberra: Australia discovered a major deal between Nauru and a Chinese company through a press release, months after signing a pact that demands advanced notice of security and critical infrastructure agreements. Australia is providing Nauru AU$100 million (about K270m) in budget support and AU$40 million (about K108m) for policing in exchange for an effective veto of security and critical infrastructure agreements with third countries. The treaty, under which Australia has transferred $40 million in 2025, stipulates Canberra must be consulted on agreements affecting Nauru’s security and critical infrastructure. Any pact then needs to be mutually agreed upon before Nauru signs. Foreign Affairs Department officials revealed they found out about a AU$1 billion (about 2.7b) infrastructure investment proposal signed by Nauru and the China Rural Revitalisation and Development Corporation via a media release. First assistant secretary in the department’s Pacific division Mark Tattersall played down concerns when questioned at a public hearing on Monday, saying it was only a proposal that had not yet gone to Nauru’s cabinet. Any implementation or investment was “potentially some time off”, he added. Tattersall insisted the security pact was operating as planned despite saying Australia was “interested by the language” in the Chinese agreement. “When it was released by press release on the Nauruan government website, we noted language in the proposal that potentially triggers some elements of treaty provisions,” he told a parliamentary hearing into the treaty. “We’ve reached out to Nauru and counterparts to seek further details.” Australia has since received further details, Tattersall said. “We have agreed to continue any discussions with Nauruan counterparts to see if treaty provisions are indeed triggered by the proposal,” he said. Canberra has also reached out to Beijing. Tattersall admitted Australia had found “not a great deal” of detail about the Chinese company. “There does not appear to be a large body of internet presence for the entity in China,” he said. Liberal MP Henry Pike said it was “strange that it wasn’t flagged by the government of Nauru”. He questioned the rationale for calm after Tattersall referred to the agreement as “just … an investment proposal at this time”. “It seems strange to me that something … isn’t officially policy of the Nauruan government when you’ve got the minister for foreign affairs and trade and his deputy in Beijing signing a document,” Pike said. Officials from Australia and Nauru have formally met six times to discuss their treaty’s implementation. Department of Foreign Affairs assistant secretary Jeff Roach said the treaty ensured Pacific security issues would be tackled by Pacific nations, something Australia is championing as it tussles with Chinese influence in the region. Nauru ratified the treaty in February after it was signed by the two nations’ leaders in Canberra in December 2024 but it still needs to pass the Australian parliament. Tattersall said he hoped it would be ratified before Pacific island leaders meet for a regional forum in mid-September. Source: AAP",Politics,Surprise,Nill,The National
Trump to chair Gaza meeting in Washington this week,https://www.thenational.com.pg/trump-to-chair-gaza-meeting-in-washington-this-week/,27/08/2025,"Gaza: US special envoy Steve Witkoff says President Donald Trump will chair a meeting on Gaza at the White House and added that Washington expects Israel’s war in the Palestinian territory to be settled by the end of the year. The meeting will be held on Wednesday. The US State Department separately said Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar in Washington the same day. Trump had promised a swift end to the war in Gaza during the 2024 US election campaign and after taking office in January, but almost seven months into his term, that stated goal remains elusive. An Israeli security official said on Tuesday that none of the five journalists were among the six Hamas targets killed. Israeli forces struck Nasser hospital in Khan Younis in the south of the enclave on Monday, killing at least 20 people including journalists who worked for Reuters, the Associated Press, al-Jazeera and other outlets. In its statement on Tuesday, the Israeli military said troops had identified what it said was a camera “positioned by Hamas” in the area to observe its forces. It said they operated to remove the threat by striking and dismantling the camera. The statement identified what it called “several gaps” that Israel’s Chief of the General Staff had instructed be further examined: “Firstly, a further examination of the authorisation process prior to the strike, including the ammunition approved for the strike and the timing of the authorisation. “Secondly, an examination of the decision-making process in the field.” The statement said the Chief of the General Staff had emphasised that the Israeli military directs its activities solely toward military targets. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Monday that Israel deeply regretted what he called a “tragic mishap”. An Israeli military spokesman said on Tuesday that journalists working for Reuters and Associated Press were not a target of Israel’s strike on Nasser hospital. “We can confirm that the Reuters and AP journalists were not a target of the strike,” he said. On Monday, the Reuters live video feed from the hospital, which cameraman Hussam al-Masri, a Reuters contractor, had been operating, suddenly shut down at the moment of the initial strike. Masri was killed in the attack. Reuters and other news providers often deliver live video feeds to media outlets worldwide during major news events to show the scene from the ground in real time. Reuters has frequently broadcast a feed from Nasser hospital during the Gaza Strip war, and for the past several weeks had been delivering daily feeds from the hospital position that was hit. The journalists killed also included Mariam Abu Dagga, who freelanced for the Associated Press and other outlets, Mohammed Salama, who worked for Qatar-based broadcaster al-Jazeera, Moaz Abu Taha, a freelance journalist who worked with several news organisations including occasionally contributing to Reuters, and Ahmed Abu Aziz.

"Unitech student fined for obstructing police duty, locked up in Buimo",https://www.thenational.com.pg/unitech-student-fined-for-obstructing-police-duty-locked-up-in-buimo/,25/08/2025,"A MAGISTRATE on Friday ordered a second year student of Papua New Guinea University of Technology in Lae, Morobe to pay K4,000 fine or face two years in jail at Buimo Prison. Ezekiel Kimbu, 26, from Goroka’s Kama village in Eastern Highlands, was convicted by magistrate Nasiling Bingtau after finding him guilty of one count of obstructing a lawful instruction from a member of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary. The court fined Kimbu and ordered that his K300 bail be converted to court fine which leaves K3,700 to be paid before being released. Bingtau further ordered that three months be deducted from Kimbu’s two-year jail term, which means he will now serve one year and nine months in prison. He will be kept in custody at Buimo Prison until such time that his fine is paid in full. On Aug 9, 2025, Kimbu was at East Taraka in Lae, Morobe between 2am and 3am when police caught up with him. At that time, police noticed drunkards standing in front of a canteen and were drinking and making loud noises. The drunkards were cautioned by a member of the police to leave the place and the canteen keeper to close her store as it was into late hours. At that time, police took into consideration a fresh ethnic clash in Lae so such groupings in the odd hours was not tolerated. Kimbu then asked the police why they asked for the shop to close when nothing was happening there at that time. Police arrested Kimbu for disobeying and obstructing police duty, charged him and had him before the court where he was found guilty as charged and sentenced.",Law,Sadness,Nill,The National

Marape praised Solomon Islands’ tourism potential, encouraging Papua New Guineans and the international community to visit. “PNG is still growing in tourism, but our cousins in the Solomon Islands will look after you well. “They are not an extension of PNG. They are a proud nation of their own,” Marape said. Manele departed for Australia on Friday.",Politics,Trust,James Marape,The National
